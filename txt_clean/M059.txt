This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   .   Section 4: CEP Overview      The SLT developed mission of the Beekman Hill International School is to inspire in all of our children the joy of  learning, which transforms wonder into knowledge and knowledge into accomplishment, while fostering empathy  and a love and respect for themselves and all others. P.S. 59's purpose is to positively motivate our students to  become critical thinkers, able to express themselves in creative ways. We aim to construct a school environment in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      which we cultivate the healthy development of their academic, physical, personal, social and emotional personal  selves, poised to become happy productive world citizens.               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Beekman Hill international is an elementary school with 600 students from kindergarten through grade 5. As noted in  detail on the following page, the school population comprises approximately 3% Black, 16% Hispanic, 62% White, and  11% Asian students. Boys account for 52% of the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. Roughly 8% of students  receive free and reduced price lunch.       One of PS 59’s most distinctive features is its diversity, though statistics do not fully reflect the appearance of our  classrooms. While many schools have a greater percentage of English language learners, more often students are  drawn from a somewhat smaller, more homogeneous pool of languages than the three dozen or so spoken by PS 59  students. As a zoned elementary school with no magnet programs to enroll students from beyond the immediate  neighborhood, it seems remarkable to have students born in over 40 distinct nations in the heart of Manhattan.  Because the United Nations abuts the school’s geographic zone, many students register with their family’s eclectic  diplomatic passports, with family members serving in roles ranging from support personnel to officials. It is not  uncommon for students to speak several languages at home while never qualifying for ENL services. Students register  in hard to predict clusters from, for example, the Ukraine and Russia, China and Mongolia, Qatar and Turkey, or  Hungary and Nepal.    While virtually all schools now offer some version of collaborative team teaching to deliver special education services,  we feel PS59 is distinguished by its passionate dedication to ICT. Teachers, service providers, and administrators feel  gratified at the school's deepening capacity to build success and independence in kids who need considerable  additional supports; we are proud of the longitudinal progress of older students who entered our ICT cohort in  kindergarten, and of our dogged efforts to maintain inclusive classrooms for students whose needs might previously  had led to placement in more restrictive settings far from their general education peers. The additional professional  development in which the school invests to support collaborative teachers who can intensify individualization mean  our data indicate ICT makes our general education students thrive. What ICT has taught us about differentiation  continues to flow to other classrooms through the sharing of practices and strategic organization efforts, to  strengthen teaching and learning across the school.   PS 59’s sense of community feels perhaps most remarkable. Parents routinely cite the warmth and familiarity among  adults whose children attend the school, and speak appreciatively of the opportunity to come to their children’s class  for monthly Family Fridays and regular morning curricular workshops to further academic support at home. Teachers  repeatedly describe themselves as exceptionally collegial. Those who volunteer on the new teacher hiring committee  often tell interviewees that PS 59’s best resource for professional learning is access to daily conversation with other  thoughtful, engaged teachers. Asked to describe the school for an exercise with our School Leadership Team, a  kindergarten teacher in her second year remarked that both her official and unofficial first-year mentors continue to  visit her classroom, not just to push her thinking, but to be pushed themselves. A teacher in her first full year stated  that the “collaborative atmosphere is an invaluable feature.” An ICT teacher suggested that being able to discuss her  in-class observations of individual occupational therapy goals with both the OT and the school’s gym teacher in ICT  team meeting structures and PPT means she is more conscious of her students’ overall development. It is what she   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      called an “appreciation for the whole child” that ensures a rapidly growing school continues to feel intimate, helps  kids be well known, and strengthens the school’s ethos of reflective differentiation.    In ongoing efforts to support the whole child, including his or her social and emotional self, PS59 has taken a number  of steps and strengthened a variety of partnerships. We have a longstanding relationship with Mentoring USA via  Bloomingdale’s. Close to 100 mentors support students over the course of two to three years in weekly lunchtime  sessions, allowing them to develop close relationships. Similarly, close to 100 young professionals serving as reading  buddies from Read Ahead, mentoring students during lunchtime. In addition, we have invested in a robust guidance  staff, employing two full time counselors, one an experienced social worker, though our CSE caseload funds roughly  half of one counselor. This allows counselors to host morning yoga sessions, lunchtime book clubs, facilitate work with  peer mediators, lead student council and run a track team, as well as see at risk students and serve as crisis  interventionists with students demonstrating severe behavioral challenges. For several years we have also partnered  with Child Mind Institute to provide another layer of support for students who are experiencing trauma (i.e., illness,  death, separation or divorce in the family, etc.) As expectations increase for schools to serve in a role that  approximates mental health services we strive continually to enhance our skills and expand our capacity to embrace  all students.    We continue to invent new ways to support collaborative leadership and a growth mindset culture of teaching and  learning.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 7% English language learners and 17% special education students. We currently have more  than 50 students with IEPs enrolled in our ICT classes. They represent a range of strengths and a diversity needs  including cognitive challenges that run the gamut from mild learning disabilities to those that are more dramatic,  speech and language based disabilities, social and emotional needs and physical disabilities. Some receive SETSS in  addition to their all day ICT placement, as an added layer of support.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.   Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.   PS59 is a professional community in which all members reflect a growth mindset, and expect to perpetually outgrow  themselves. The principal and administration sees this as among their primary responsibilities - ensuring skilled and  knowledgeable teachers lead each and every classroom. This impacts all aspects of our school culture and community  as well as each of the elements of the framework. This year we have continued to challenge ourselves in terms of  enhancing instruction by building a more collaborative community of teachers and professionals. Teachers have  participated in specialty groups at the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and used 'other teacher work  time' to bring that new learning back to colleagues. Similarly, our Big Apple Award winner participated all year in  citywide leadership conversations as well as attending District 2 math leadership opportunities and Metamorphosis  "TLCs." We've established a more robust mentoring program with monthly meetings for mentors and mentees with a  yearlong curriculum of learning opportunities, as well as social events with mentors, mentees and school  administrators. We've also established and formalized a new structure for professional learning in small groups  around areas of shared interest, dubbing them inquiry cycles. We've hosted two this spring and have more planned   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      for the fall. As we strive to cultivate leadership among teachers, our new Assistant Principal is proud to describe  herself as 'home-grown' having taught here in multiple grades and positions across ten years and has now made a  seamless transition into the school leadership position. We've devoted a tremendous amount of attention and effort  into professional learning around math and are excited to be thinking ahead toward another year with an on staff  math coach. We engaged in data driven professional study geared toward identifying strengths and weaknesses in our  work with kids. In response to those results, we designed intervention, enrichment and increased PD.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M059   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   614   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Our June Instructional Report summarizing school- and grade-data from the NYS ELA and Math assessments indicate  varying needs by grade. While as a school we continue to outperform the district, city and state, our overall NYS  testing data in ELA reflects a slight drop from 82% proficient to 78% proficient, reflecting a lower proficiency rating in  our substantially smaller third grade cohort. In our data inquiry work we noted the lower rate of proficiency reflected  similar trends on second grade reading level data and may indicate a need for more robust supports in grade 2 and 3.  In prior years with other cohorts, when this has happened, students typically rebound in fourth and fifth grade as they  become more familiar with the assessments. While there are small variations in some data sets, several are of note.  Our girls tend to perform at higher proficiency levels than our boys the last two years. Student performance in third  grade indicates a need to improve writing about reading, particularly in response to informational text, as it is a  relatively new skill for many. We hear high level thinking reflected in classroom discussions and will continue to strive  to support students in transferring those skills to this writing genre. Grade 4 and 5 students would benefit from  improved skills in determining the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in both fiction and non-fiction texts.  This testing data is mirrored to a degree in our classroom independent reading whole book assessments.       Several additional areas have stood out in our work together this spring. Observation cycles indicate a need for math  curriculum that is more consistently rigorous, vertically aligned, and geared toward depth of understanding. Similarly,  our writing instruction in the upper grades would benefit from a greater emphasis on cultivating students who can  think, talk and write about their reading, and write with power, joy and purpose. Finally, we are always aiming to  expand our capacity to meet the needs of every child by making the school environment as supportive as possible.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   The Framework for Great Schools calls for instruction that is customized, inclusive, motivating and aligned to the CCLS  with students engaged in ambitious intellectual activity that supports the development of critical thinking skills.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      By June of 2019, we will aim for teacher teams on all grades to implement with fidelity a minimum of two context for  learning investigations in mathematics and for students to be engaged accordingly in rigorous mathematical thinking  aligned with the Framework and the CCLS.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Students K-5  9/18-6/19         Revisit the need to adopt a Core Math Program, as opposed to  the comprehensive set of Context for Learning Investigations, in  order to support newer colleagues in the school and on the  grade, in teaching grade level curriculum efficiently and  effectively. We would continue to encourage grade level teams  to make use of creative and engaging supplements, such as Math  in the City and teacher designed investigations.      To support teachers in these efforts, we will invest in Cathy  Fosnot's New Perspectives online platform which provides a wide  range of professional development resources including content  information, video sample lessons and conferences, and a guide  to math congresses.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15                3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  We will use Tuesday morning parent engagement time to host workshops by grade level strands that build families'  capacity to serve as strong and informed partners in supporting students. In addition, teachers will be open during  this time for one on one parent meetings and other forms of communication. By mid-year we will host math  meetings for families in three grade level bands: Pre-K-1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5. We plan to survey families post- conference regarding the effectiveness of each session. We plan to have Family Fridays allocated such that families  have multiple opportunities to engage with students in class in math activities and investigations that mirror the  CFL work typically engaged in.    We now keep families informed of school initiatives through our schoolwide Weebly presence that includes  regularly [Monthly/Weekly] updated class pages with links to curriculum overviews, upcoming events, and  resources for both parents and students (e.g. articles, website).    We have invested in a schoolwide subscription to Dreambox which gives students access at home and in school to  mathematical resources that adjust according to student need. It provides families with the opportunity to gain  greater familiarity with math strategies and content and to monitor their child's progress at school and at home.  Dreambox uses mathematical language and tools that parallels what is being discussed in the classroom, giving  parents a greater understanding of what is happening in the classroom. Both families and teachers have access to  the data on Dreambox, ensuring consistency with understanding student progress. A literacy subscription to  Learning Ally was implemented this year which gives students access to an online library of leveled e-books from  any electronic device. This allows for families to log on to read with their children and become knowledgeable  about reading levels. Learning Ally also will read texts to children in order to help their comprehension, thus  allowing students to interact with texts above their reading levels.           Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  We plan to leverage our professional development efforts to support within- and cross-grade professional inquiry  on this topic, and maximize our implementation of expertise gained through outside consultants. We will use  NYSTL funds to support the purchase of curricular materials, online subscriptions and select related professional  reading.         Part 4b.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  By January 2018 we will aim for Dropbox (or Google Drive) shared units of study for the first half of the year to  meet set criteria for strategy instruction and the introduction of specific models, and to include specific vocabulary  terms for each unit.       By January 2018 we will carry out a cycle of observations focused on math discourse.      By January of 2018 we will host three meetings for families - one for lower grade mathematics, one for upper grade  mathematics, and one on Dreambox.       By January of 2018 we will have implemented, scored, gathered and shared data on student performance in  mathematics via BOY NYCDOE performance tasks.      Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  We will collaborate with the math coach and classroom teachers to design a checklist for units of study for each  grade. E-CAM data will reflect a gradual increase in student performance in primary grades. Teacher-designed  classroom assessments will reflect a gradual increase in student performance in the upper grades.       Advance observation data will reflect ratings of Highly Effective or Effective for all returning classroom teachers in the  area of 3B and 3D.      Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans     Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and  school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The Framework for Great Schools emphasizes the importance of a school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers. That sort of school culture is threaded with structures that ensure each  student is known well as a 'whole child' by at least one adult, and preferably the community, who helps to personalize  a wide range of supports and coordinate social-emotional learning, child/youth development, and guidance supports  that impact students’ academic and personal behaviors and lifelong healthy habits. A comprehensive needs  assessment of PS59, and we suspect most school communities, reveals that we are welcoming cohorts of students in  recent years whose social and emotional needs are more pronounced and complex and may tax the equitable  distribution of resources across the whole of the school. Many students face illness, divorce and separation, and other  life disruptions that undermine their persistence and resilience and ability to be happy and successful in school. OORS  reports as well as soft data including staff surveys, parent feedback, the nature of recent incidents, and direct  observation all point to the need for an even greater level of coordinated support.   In addition, in recognition of recent research, we aim to provide students with enhanced opportunities for physical  activity, and access to a comprehensive health program (e.g., adolescence, cyber-safety, conflict resolution) that  better prepares them for wellness in middle school and beyond.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June of 2019 PS59 will build more robust support systems, adding to an already extensive web of wellness supports  incorporating social, emotional and related academic needs, maximizing personnel and community resources  proactively to offer opportunities and services for all students while reducing the amount of behavioral referrals , with  a focus on all grades including Pre-k through 5.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Beekman Hill International School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [PS59] will support parents and families of Title I students by:       ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;       Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:       ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Beekman Hill International, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by  Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.       Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with Common Core State Standards to enable participating  children to meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:    I.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY  Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components:  1.   The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

All benefit from scaffolded literacy supports across the day  providing them access to more complex texts and to grade level content that meets and exceeds  grade level expectations.  Title III funding will be used to support several supplemental direct  instruction initiatives as described below:  Our Title III LEP supplemental enrichment program will consist of a before and after school  program. Morning sessions will run for two hours per week, M, TH and F mornings from 8:00- 8:40 am.  Afternoon sessions will take place three afternoons per week from 3:00-4:30pm.  Our  ENL teacher will co-teach with classroom teachers. In that way we can best accommodate our  students, staff and families.  While the bulk of the allocation will go toward per session for direct  session, $1449 will be used for materials including: Refreshed leveled text collections (e.g.,  Rigby On Our Way to English Leveled Readers; Leveled Literacy Instruction take home  books).  Instruction will take place in English.    Our standardized assessment results, including NYSESLAT, indicate that upper grade students  continue to benefit from support in developing proficiency in writing. Our strongest academic  supports have traditionally been offered in grades K-2; students entering PS59 after second  grade, particularly those requiring additional supports such as our ELLs, tend to be at a  disadvantage. As part of an effort to remedy this, early bird (8:00-8:40 M, TH, F) and after- school (M-F 3:00-4:30) literacy programs will be provided for students in grades 3-5 who face  high stakes NYS assessments in April and May, the results of which impact the middle school  choices they will have.  Title III funds will be dedicated to per session for teams comprised of  general education teachers team teaching with our ENL teacher so that planning and instruction  is more effectively targeted toward ENL students.  Our general education teachers will focus on  the content of writing while the ENL teacher will provide scaffolded language support.  Students  will meet in small performance level cohorts two to three times a week for the 2-3 weeks prior to  the NYS literacy assessments and the 2-3 weeks prior to the NYS math assessments. All of our  upper grade ENL students will participate.   The program will begin in January and run  through May, with before and after school sessions on varying days by class, Monday through  Friday.  Our incoming ENL teacher will collaborate with one teacher on each grade level to co- teach the cohort of students on that grade where we will cluster our ENL students.  The program  will be conducted over the course of 12 weeks.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45   rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             Sarah Seliger at the MFSC will provide professional development to our ENL teacher at no cost  to Title III.

We seek to help parents to understand their children’s educational goals and our  in-school practices so parents are better supported in being effective partners. The ENL teacher  hosts an ENL parent information session in the first days of school to outline our program and  how it supports their children. Across the year, our ENL teacher collaborates with classroom  teachers to reach out directly to parents of ENLs to ensure participation in community  building as well as learning opportunities hosted at school.  We host three workshops for Title III LEP families and all ENL students. The parent morning  workshops will be hosted by our ENL teacher in collaboration with our parent coordinator and a  classroom teacher.  The purpose of the workshops is to support families in becoming knowledgeable about how they  can support students in their academic growth.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?     PS 59 uses a combination of assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  Teachers administer Concepts  About Print, Letter/Sound Identification, as well as High Frequency Words assessments in addition to TCRWP formal running  records, Whole Book assessments, In-book assessments and Performance Tasks. Performance Tasks and Whole Book  assessments also serve as an indicator of writing proficiency in addition to the On-Demand and Baseline writing assessments  which are also administered. These assessments are complemented by informal observations during carefully targeted  individual conferences in both reading and writing. These assessments show that many of our early readers are still working on  their reading skills, but in general are progressing steadily through reading levels.  Our school also relies on Words Their Way  inventories to provide information about the literacy development of our ELLs.  Many of our Beginner and Intermediate ELLs  are in the Letter Name Alphabetic and Within-Word Pattern stage on the Synchrony of Literacy Development.  Reading  assessments generally show that our Beginning level ELLs who have just arrived from their home countries are typically   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      reading below grade level, and those who have been in our school for more than two years are reading at higher levels but still  need additional support with inferring and comprehension, as well as self-expression in oral and written forms.  Therefore the  majority of our ELLs participate in Early Bird sessions and some of our 1st and 2nd grade ELLs work with our Reading Recovery  teacher to build their reading skills, including phonemic awareness, decoding, background knowledge and comprehension  skills.  Classroom teachers as well as the ESL teacher work with all our ELLs to build and develop both oral and written  academic language which can help ELLs master content. Information from student assessments is used when planning for  instruction, as well as when targeting skills and setting student goals.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Professional development in the administration of a variety of assessments and shared time for analyzing student work in  grade level and cross grade teams.  Before and during school small group intervention, after school support for students taking  NYS assessments.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     When evaluating the success of our ESL program, we take into account data from multiple assessments in different areas. The  NYSESLAT is a major indicator of ELL progress as it is the one standardized test that is ELL specific and gives data for all four  language modalities. Knowing the breakdown in modality for each student enables teachers to understand each student’s  areas of strength and areas for development which is essential for planning targeted instruction. NYSESLAT results also show  how our school is succeeding in meeting the Annual Measurable Achievement objectives (AMAOs).  Although we are still  awaiting the RNMR report that will enable us to calculate our exact AMAO progress, we can still see favorable results from  previous NYSESLAT results overall. According to May 2015 NYSESLAT results, 10% of students scored at the Entering level, 6%  scored at the Emerging level, 3% scored at the Transitioning level, 32% scored at the Expanding level, and 48% scored at the  Commanding level. In addition, two students passed out of ESL according to the new proficiency measure of scoring an  Advanced or Expanding on NYSESLAT and a 3 or 4 on the ELA. Of the 14 students who took the NYSESLAT for the first time, 11  scored at the Emerging level or higher, as 1 scored at the Emerging level after one month of instruction, 4 scored at the  Expanding level, and 6 scored at the Commanding level.  Of the 17 students who had already taken the NYSESLAT in prior  years, 13 students moved up one or more levels, with 9 scoring at the Commanding level.  Of the 4 who stayed at the same  level, 1 student was at the Expanding level on the cusp of becoming Commanding, and the other 3 are students with IEP and a  reading and writing disability or speech disability.      We also rely on assessments such as TC Running Records, whole book assessments, performance tasks, standardized tests, as  well as classroom work and writing pieces that are aligned with the CCCS to evaluate the success of our program for ELLs.  We  look at movement in reading levels, as well as comprehension, oral language skills, and performance in other content areas.      Finally, we consider the participation of parents to be very important, and consider parental involvement in trips, school  events and other activities to be evidence that our ELLs are integrating effectively into our school community.  It is this  combination of academic achievement and social integration that informs us as to how our program is advancing.             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We use team meetings, grade level and cross grade meetings, after school professional development, and RTI/PPT teams that  analyze results to determine effective responses.  Interventions are implemented by all staff with additional slots in their  schedules.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50            Within the Response to Intervention framework, student data in the form of assessments and observational anecdotes is used  when discussing concerns relating to the student’s progress at RTI meetings, which are held weekly. As noted above,  assessment data includes TC running records, whole book reading assessments, performance assessments, on-demand writing  assessments, Concepts About Print, and phonemic awareness assessments, as well as Words Their Way spelling inventories.  After discussing a student at an RTI/PPT meeting, teachers leave with strategies and suggestions on how to support the  student in the general classroom.  If students need further support based upon data and recommendations by the RTI team,  students may then receive Tier II support in the form of small group intervention. If small group intervention during specified  rounds of after/before school is not sufficient for students who require more individualized instruction, Tier III support is  provided in the form of Reading Recovery, Reading Rescue or at-risk SETSS. Reading Recovery, Reading Rescue and at-risk  SETSS are provided on a 1:1 basis for students who have not made sufficient progress in Tiers I and II as reflected in their  assessment and observational data.            6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results place most of our current students at the Entering, Expanding, and Commanding levels. This  fall, we have 10 students at the Entering level, 3 at the Emerging level, 9 at the Expanding level, 0 at the Transitioning level, 9  at the Expanding level, and 6 at the Commanding level. The Entering students are split between upper and lower grades, with  3 in Kindergarten, 3 in 1st grade, 2 in 4th grade, and 2 in 5th grade. The Expanding students are spread across all the grades  except for Kindergarten, with 3 in 1st grade, 2 in 2nd grade, 2 in 3rd grade, 1 in 4th grade, and 1 in 5th grade. The  Commanding students are mostly in the upper grades, with 2 in 2nd grade, 2 in 4th grade, and 4 in 5th grade. This data reflects  the nature of our student population, as we register new students each year from around the world. When students first  arrive, they are at the beginning or Entering level. However, after a year or two, they quickly gain proficiency in English. This  explains why we do not have any students at the Transitioning level. Also, sometimes we register new students in the spring,  sometimes even after the NYSESLAT has been administered. Those students test as Entering on the NYSITELL and remain at  that level until the NYSESLAT is administered again the following spring. We also register new students who have some  proficiency in English. They often test at the Expanding level.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our ELL teacher works closely and participates in all study groups and team meetings in order to effectively communicate  regarding the achievement of our ELLs.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      In our school’s Freestanding ENL program, students who require standalone ENL are pulled out of their general  education classroom for direct ENL instruction with the TESOL certified ENL teacher. Students are pulled in groups  that are formed by taking students’ grade level and English language proficiency level into account. Students are  grouped within two continguous grades and within two language proficiency levels in order to allow for an effective   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         range of abilities within each group and similar needs within the group that enable students to feel comfortable and  encourage risk-taking with language production. Integrated instruction is provided with the ENL teacher in  conjunction with a common-branch certified general education classroom teacher, whereby the ENL teacher pushes  in to co-teach and support ELLs within their own classroom.                b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        PS 59 does not have a TBE program.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.         PS 59 does not have a DL program.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our students are grouped by proficiency levels so that Entering and Emerging students receive their mandated 360 minutes of  explicit ENL instruction per week and Transitioning and Expanding students receive their mandated 180 minutes of ENL  instruction per week. In addition to 180 minutes of explicit ESL instruction, Advanced ELLs also receive 180 minutes or more of  ELA instruction per week with their classroom teacher. As PS 59 does not have enough of a language majority in the student  population to offer a dual language or transitional bilingual program, native language arts is not offered.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the Freestanding ENL program, the goal is to build English language skills through content area instruction. Consequently, all  core content is delivered in English using ESL strategies, with native language support. The ENL teacher plans units of  instruction that support language development by integrating the teaching of language skills and vocabulary along with ELA,  Science, and Social Studies. ENL teacher collaborates closely with content area teachers (e.g., science, art) gathering relevant  vocabulary, preteaching and/or pairing visual supports with unit vocabulary and language structures in classroom resources to  provide scaffolded supports. Units are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, and assessments are given to  determine the level at which students are currently performing (i.e., running records, IRA, on demand writing tasks for each  unit, genre and grade specific language checklists and rubrics, exit slips in mathematics).  Instruction is then planned to meet  students in their zone of proximal development and scaffold them toward grade level expectations. Teachers strive to apply  Universal Design principles, incorporating effective ESL strategies that build students’ listening, speaking, reading, and writing  skills, along with making content comprehensible, students are able to build English language skills along with core content  knowledge. PS 59 does not have a dual language or transitional bilingual program.                4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      For Spanish-speaking students whose NYSITELL scores indicate that they are entitled to ESL services, the Spanish LAB is also  administered.  The Spanish LAB is given by the ESL teacher and a native Spanish speaker on our staff.  In Fall 2012 there were  two  students who required the  Spanish LAB.  Following parent preferences and small numbers of each of our ELL home  languages, we have not needed to evaluate students in any other languages for placement in Dual Language or TBE   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      programs.  Therefore, with the exception of the Spanish LAB, we do not evaluate students in their home languages.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       ESL instructional planning at PS 59 takes into account both students’ ESL level and strengths, as well as their grade-level  expectations and goals.       a) P.S. 59 does not currently have SIFE students. If we had a SIFE student, we would strive to get the most accurate  information possible regarding the child's history (social and if any, academic). We would liaise with appropriate social service  agencies (refugee centers, if applicable, etc.). We would attempt to accurately assess the child's literacy, math and other  academic skills to see what the best groups and programs would be for the child. In addition, we would provide mentoring for  the child via a same age buddy, and through continuous assessment and instruction, in addition to working with the child's  parents/guardians, ensure that the child is able to integrate into our school community while maintaining connections to his or  her first culture. We would provide a combination of small group instruction and grade-level specific content-based  instruction.      b) Newcomer classes focus on helping students build a bank of vocabulary and language that will help them with daily  interactions in school. The goal is for students to build social language as quickly as possible, in addition to introducing  academic language that will help them in the classroom. Through ESL classes which integrate content with language, students  acquire content while learning reading, writing, and language skills with grammar infused throughout. Through content  learning, students build both oral and written language.  Reading and writing strategies are taught in order to support students  in classroom learning, as well as help them work towards grade-level goals.      c) For developing ELLs, support focuses especially on strengthening the academic conversation skills of this group of children,  in order to foster academic writing.  Academic vocabulary and syntax are especially emphasized, as well as building listening  comprehension through partner and whole group discussions. Building oral academic language and conversations is PS 59’s  instructional focus, and through targeted instruction in the general classroom as well as the ESL classroom. Through targeted  instruction and practice with higher-level vocabulary and language, we hope to help developing ELLs quickly attain the  proficiency necessary to pass the NYSESLAT and be successful on the ELA.      d) As PS 59 is a K-5 school, we have not had ELLs receiving services for more than six years (Long Term ELLs), if this situation  were to occur, we would develop a focused plan to target this student’s needs. We would focus on strategies that would help  build skills in areas of weakness in order to move the student forward.      e) Former ELLs who have passed out of ESL continue to receive support in academic language through oral conversation and  writing, as well as targeted vocabulary support to help students build robust language skills. Although students may have  passed out of the NYSESLAT, in order for these students to do well on the ELA and rise to the challenge posed by the Common  Core State Standards, students are given support with higher-level thinking, reading and writing skills, all of which are based  on high-level partner, small-group, and whole-group conversations.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Teachers support our ELL-SWDs both inside and outside of the classroom in developing their English language skills by using  strategies and techniques that are specific to each child’s IEP and planning instruction that targets student needs.  Teachers of  ELL-SWD students use balanced literacy in a to-with-by gradual release approach, using instructional strategies that scaffold  and support students, providing multiple entry points and multiple ways to demonstrate understanding. Students are  immersed in language rich environments, all classrooms (including science and art) include extensive libraries with a range of  text levels and topics to support students’ developing skills as well as interests.  Given our large number of students with  speech and language classifications, classroom resources (i.e., charts, labels) include visual supports such as photos,  illustrations and illustrative examples.  Classrooms have access to an extensive collection of reader’s theater resources,  provding authentic and engaging opportunities for oral rehearsal and fluency practice.  All classrooms have access to state of  the art laptops which they may use to access reading programs, audiobooks, and vocabulary building programs.  We are  building a collection of i-pads and e-readers so that students who benefit from multi-modal support can enhance their skills  and engagement.  Content for ELL-SWD students is grade appropriate, with instructional materials provided at the reading  level of the student in order to allow for student access to grade-level content. With the additional support of small group  instruction, teaching grade level content with reading-level appropriate materials allows for ELL-SWD to access academic  content while supporting their English language development.  The ESL teacher consults with the SETSS teacher, speech  teacher, guidance counselors, collaborative team teachers, and occupational therapists about ELLs with special needs, sharing  ideas, notes and strategies that are working.  Small group support by the Reading Recovery teacher provides additional reading  and writing instruction for first and second graders.  Reading Rescue is an intervention program conducted before school and  during the school day for identified students in first grade, including ELLs and ELL-SWDs that provides additional opportunities  for targeted, one-on-one attention for students. In our first year of implementation, 2014-2015, the program proved  effective.  We've trained additional tutors this year to expand the program.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     Through collaboration with the team of teachers and specialists working with each child, an individualized schedule with a  combination of special programs (such as Reading Recovery, SETSS, Speech, OT, and PT where applicable), whole group  instruction, small group instruction, and in-class interventions is developed to best support each of our ELL-SWDs toward  meeting their student’s goals.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Teachers scaffold and provide extra support for all ELLs  (especially newcomers) in their Literacy blocks as well as in science,  math and social studies.  Instruction is made richer and more accessible through the use of an inquiry method in which  students generate questions of interest, and are immersed in content area investigations.   Teachers ensure students not only  read and discuss texts across content areas, but examine authentic artifacts, visual images and primary sources. Additional  targeted intervention is provided through our extended day small group instructional programs before and after school.  For  ELLs receiving services for 4-6 years, teachers conduct more frequent Guided Reading sessions aimed at supporting them in  transitioning across levels at an accelerated pace; teachers use strategy lessons to focus on individual writing  needs.  Instruction also uses programs such as Readers’ Theater to cultivate improved reading habits and strengthen reading  skills. Research-based Words Their Way is used to identify and target specific gaps in reading and spelling skills. ELLs with  special needs or at risk also benefit from small group instruction in reading or math with the SETSS teacher.  The school  convenes an intervention squad each September to identify students at risk and ensure that supports are in place.  The  Reading Recovery teacher supports students in 1st grade who need Tier III intervention, as well as other struggling 1st and 2nd  grade students who need additional small group support with phonemic awareness and reading skills. Students, including ELLs,  benefit from our Reading Rescue morning and daytime program, funded through a partnership with Teachers College.  Our ten  trained tutors support students one on one each morning and during the day.  Students in grades three through five are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      provided after and before school test preparation classes in math and literacy for 3-5 weeks before NYS assessments. Since  there is a great diversity of home languages at PS 59, all targeted intervention programs are conducted in English. As always,  ELLs are encouraged to make use of their home language as a support where applicable.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?         For the upcoming school year, we are planning to continue with our Freestanding ESL program due to the varied language  backgrounds of our student population. We do not anticipate starting a Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual program as we  do not have more than 3 students in two continguous grades who share the same home language receiving ESL services.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?      No programs will be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.     All of our ELL students have access to enriched school programs, including weekly music instruction, keyboarding instruction  provided before and after school by our fully licensed and highly qualified music teacher, opportunities to audition for our  upper grade school chorus, opportunities to perform with all students in two school-wide musical productions in December  and June, weekly art studio sessions with a licensed NYC DOE art instructor and early bird art programs for select students in 8- week cycles, and weekly technology classes. Kindergarten students participate in our Arts Connection dance program, 1st  graders participate in African dance, 2nd graders participate in the City Center dance program, 3rd – 5th graders participate in  Stages of Learning theater instruction and a drama production as well as a NY Philharmonic classical music program, and all  students in grades K – 5 participate in a chess program. Our ELLs are included on all school trips, the Title III program, CASA  after school arts programs, Girl Scouts, track team, and PTA-sponsored after school clubs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     All ELLs have access to laptops in technology class as well as in the classroom. Newcomer ELLs are given opportunities to use  laptops in class to provide access to online activities and educational websites to build their reading and language skills.  They  are also given picture dictionaries to help them with vocabulary during class assignments.  Native language glossaries are  provided to ELLs who would benefit from this during tests and in class.  SmartBoards help provide visual aids in all classrooms;  Words Their Way targets individual spelling/reading needs; and Reader’s Theater helps to build fluency and confidence.  Students are immersed in language rich environments, all classrooms (including science and art) include extensive libraries  with a range of text levels and topics to supportstudents’ developing skills as well as interests.  Given our large number of  students with speech and language classifications, classroom resources (i.e., charts, labels) include photos, illustrations and  illustrative examples.  Classrooms have access to an extensive collection of reader’s theater resources, provding authentic and  engaging opportunities for oral rehearsal and fluency practice.  All classrooms have access to state of the art laptops which  they may use to access reading programs, audiobooks, and vocabulary building programs.  We are building a collection of i- pads and e-readers so that students who benefit from multi-modal support can enhance their skills and engagement.  Content  for ELL-SWD students is grade appropriate, with instructional materials provided at the reading level of the student in order to  allow for student access to grade-level content. With the additional support of small group instruction, teaching grade level  content with reading-level appropriate materials allows for ELL-SWD to access academic content while supporting their English  language development.  The ESL teacher consults with the SETSS teacher, speech teacher, guidance counselors, collaborative  team teachers, and occupational therapists about ELLs with special needs, sharing ideas, notes and strategies that are  working.  Small group support by the Reading Recovery teacher provides additional reading and writing instruction for first and  second graders.  Reading Rescue is an intervention program conducted before school and during the school day for identified   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      students in first grade, including ELLs and ELL-SWDs that provides additional opportunities for targeted, one-on-one attention  for students.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      In the Freestanding ENL program, native language support is provided with books in French, Spanish, Russian, Ukrainian,  Italian, Turkish and Japanese in the lending libraries of the ESL teacher and some classroom teachers.  Students are invited to  bring in native language books to read in addition to English books during independent reading time.  Our parents, most of  whom are quite proficient in English, are also advised that a Freestanding ESL program includes use of the home language, and  are encouraged to allow students to use the native language at home, as opposed to forcing an all-English environment.  Parents are also encouraged to help students build on and continue developing native language skills at home in order to help  foster and maintain language and literacy skills in the home language and enable easier transference to English. Students are  allowed to use their native languages for assignments as they transition to producing oral and written work in English.  A  number of staff, both in and out of classrooms, speak some of the home languages of our students, and readily help out with  translations and other communication issues if they occur.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.       Required services and supports correspond to the ages, grade levels and ELL levels of our ELL students.  Content matches their  grade level but correspond to their reading levels in order to allow content to be accessible and comprehensible.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?       All ELLs have access to laptops in technology class as well as in the classroom. Newcomer ELLs are given opportunities to use  laptops in class to provide access to online activities and educational websites to build their reading and language skills.  They  are also given picture dictionaries to help them with vocabulary during class assignments.  Native language glossaries are  provided to ELLs who would benefit from this during tests and in class.  SmartBoards help provide visual aids in all classrooms;  Words Their Way targets individual spelling/reading needs; and Reader’s Theater helps to build fluency and confidence.  Students are immersed in language rich environments, all classrooms (including science and art) include extensive libraries  with a range of text levels and topics to supportstudents’ developing skills as well as interests.  Given our large number of  students with speech and language classifications, classroom resources (i.e., charts, labels) include photos, illustrations and  illustrative examples.  Classrooms have access to an extensive collection of reader’s theater resources, provding authentic and  engaging opportunities for oral rehearsal and fluency practice.  All classrooms have access to state of the art laptops which  they may use to access reading programs, audiobooks, and vocabulary building programs.  We are building a collection of i- pads and e-readers so that students who benefit from multi-modal support can enhance their skills and engagement.  Content  for ELL-SWD students is grade appropriate, with instructional materials provided at the reading level of the student in order to  allow for student access to grade-level content. With the additional support of small group instruction, teaching grade level  content with reading-level appropriate materials allows for ELL-SWD to access academic content while supporting their English  language development.  The ESL teacher consults with the SETSS teacher, speech teacher, guidance counselors, collaborative  team teachers, and occupational therapists about ELLs with special needs, sharing ideas, notes and strategies that are  working.  Small group support by the Reading Recovery teacher provides additional reading and writing instruction for first and  second graders.  Reading Rescue is an intervention program conducted before school and during the school day for identified  students in first grade, including ELLs and ELL-SWDs that provides additional opportunities for targeted, one-on-one attention  for students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      Newly enrolled ELLs take tours of our school before the school year begins or at time of enrollment if joining the school  midway through the year in order to help prepare them and know what to expect.  Our parent coordinator informs families of  the offerings at our school and reaches out to find out who may need translation services or other assistance.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?       PS 59 does not offer language electives, but the PTA sponsors afterschool French and Spanish clubs in which some of our ELLs  participate.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?      PS 59 does not offer a dual language program.           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?     1) Professional Development for ELL personnel at PS 59 is abundant and ongoing. Teachers at PS 59 engage in professional  study groups meeting weekly in cycles to learn/practice/reflect/practice/share within our community.  Topics for this year  include growth mindset, assessment, and language development.  Topics studied in prior years include close reading,  integrating literacy with content area instruction, inquiry cycles, accountable talk in Math and Reading, debate, grand  conversation, grammar and sentence structure conventions planning for all learning modalities and using bands of text to  move struggling readers. All study groups focused on supporting struggling students, and English language learners in  particular.  For a number of years the school-wide focus has been on developing oral language through academic  conversations for all students, as even native speakers of English need to learn the academic language necessary for engaging  in discussions and expressing their thoughts clearly when talking about literature as well as content area subjects. Our  collective goal is to identify and implement the most effective strategies for these students and others who might be  vulnerable.  Our principal, our assistant principal, and all teachers participate fully in these groups.  Also, on Chancellor  Professional Development days, there is often a focus on literacy for ELLs as well as the Common Core Learning Standards; all  staff members engage in professional studies on these days.  Attention to differentiation and the particular needs of ELL  students are integral to all of our literacy work. Staff developers from Teacher’s College provide professional development for  classroom teachers in study cycles, as well as a consultant from Metamorphosis who provides professional development for  math in study cycles. Each ensure their efforts are angled to emphasize structures that enhance instructional intensity for all  students including targeted small group instruction based on ongoing formative assessment. For example, primary literacy   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      consultants have coached teachers in using shared reading in a small group structure, pairing sight word review warm-up with  partner reading.  Upper grade consultants have supported teachers in developing effective strategies for teaching into making  meaning of complex vocabulary in context and constructing meaning for figurative language based on patterns of individual  student literacy assessment results.        Outside of the school, staff members serving ELLs attend professional development sessions to learn effective teaching  strategies for the ELL population. All staff members participate in an ELL training at the beginning of the school year and will  continue to receive professional development at calendar days and institutes at Teachers College throughout the year. PS 59  has also contracted with Goldmansour and Rutherford to provide 10 full days of professional development in differentiating  instruction, supporting regular classroom teachers and our ICT teams.        2) Professional development at PS 59 that takes place on Chancellor Professional Development days, after-school study group  cycles, and with outside staff developers and consultants all aim to assist all teachers in supporting ELLs with the Common  Core Learning Standards (CCLS). With the population and language diversity present at PS 59, we have many students who are  not identified as ELLs who require ESL services, but who come from homes where more than one language is spoken. As a  result, Professional Development aims to support all students in achieving goals set by the CCLS in Reading, Writing, Speaking  and Listening, and Language. Professional Development topics this year have included academic conversations and the  standards set by the CCLS by grade, as well as Performance Tasks and their alignment to the CCLS. Regardless of the topic of  Professional Development, the CCLS is interwoven throughout and taken into consideration as these are the standards that  students will be held to and need to work towards. Over the course of the last few years, we have revised and updated our  units of study across subject areas so that each is Common Core aligned. Recognizing the unique challenges of more rigorous  NYS assessments, we provide extra targeted intervention before and after school in the weeks prior to their adminsitration.            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.     3) Staff members at PS 59 are able to help 5th graders who are transitioning to middle school in several ways.  The parent  coordinator in particular provides a great deal of support for kids and families with applications and the process in general, and  making arrangements for students to go on middle school tours throughout the school year. Mentoring USA mentors from  Bloomingdale's meet with fifth grade students to help them prepare for the interview process. Fifth grade teachers have  established a relationship with several of the local middle schools our students typically attend and plan to invite sixth grade  teachers to visit students in classrooms and later to invite small groups of students for whom the transition is anticipated to be  especially challenging to visit the middle school with their classroom teachers.  They are planning to visit a nearby popular  middle school program this fall, so that they have a clearer sense of how to best prepare fifth graders for the challenges that  lie ahead.  The Parent Coordinator supports staff and families with researching middle schools and making a decision on which  schools to apply to. The ESL teacher also meets with fifth grade parents to discuss their concerns regarding middle school, and  supports them in having discussions with their children about the transition. In addition, the ESL teacher is working to develop  a relationship with the middle schools to which many ESL students attend.         4) ELL training for staff members at PS 59 is continual and ongoing for all staff members through each school year. At the  beginning of the year, teachers serving ELLs attend professional development sessions to learn effective teaching strategies for  the ELL population. All staff members participate in an ELL training at the beginning of the school year and continue to receive  professional development throughout the year.  Staff have participated in workshops that discussed how to support ELLs in  academic conversations, vocabulary development, and language development. Throughout the school year, all teachers  serving ELLs attend staff development offered through calendar days at Teachers College on topics such as supporting ELLs in  Writing Workshop and Reading Workshop, how to build academic vocabulary for ELLs, and how to support ELLs in rising to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         challenge of the Common Core Learning Standards. Professional Development days provide additional opportunities to engage  in learning and discussion about supporting ELL students. The ESL teacher has the opportunity to attend professional calendar  days at the Reading and Writing Project focused on ELLs, as well as professional development offered through the NYC DOE  Office of ELLs and through the CFN.  Our CFN ELL Specialist offers professional development days six times in the school year,  covering ESL compliance, reporting, assessment, instruction, and planning. All teachers maintain record of their professional  development sessions via an official certificate from the specific organization offering the session, as well as through notes  which teachers share with their colleagues upon return.      Powerpoints from all presentations, schedules for each literscy and math consultant day that include focus topis, principal's  weekly notes noting ongoing topics.                Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      1. The ENL teacher provides parents of ELLs with extra individual meetings to discuss program goals, language development  progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. These meetings are  in addition to the initial Parent Orientation meeting and Parent-Teacher conferences held three times each year at PS 59. In  addition students receive customized ESL progress reports in addition to those all students receive.  In order to ensure  effective communication, the necessary school staff needed to inform parents about their children’s language development in  all content areas will participate in the meeting, assisted by a qualified translator/interpreter in the parent’s preferred  language of communication as necessary.  These individual parent meetings will be scheduled by the ENL teacher to take place  during Tuesday morning Parent Engagement time, or at other times before and after school at the parent’s convenience.      2. The ENL teacher will keep records for annual individual meetings with ELL parents through use of a spreadsheet with a list of  all ELLs and Commanding students. This spreadsheet will be used to facilitate scheduling of parent meetings as well as to keep  track of past meetings, upcoming meeting dates and additional parent outreach. The ENL teacher will keep a sign-in sheet for  parents to sign when they attend these additional parent meetings. This sign-in sheet will be kept separate from Parent  Orientation sign-in sheets and Parent-Teacher conference sign-in sheets for accountability purposes.           2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      Parents are very involved at PS 59, mainly through the very active Parent Teacher Association, which holds regular meetings  and hosts a multitude of events throughout the school year.  Some of these include Meet the Teacher Night, weekly morning  coffee talks, Block Party, Fall Picnic, Scholastic Book Fair, Monster Mash, Disco Night, Picture Day, International Night, the  Spring Fling dance, Valentine's Day Ice Cream Party, Book Talks for parents, and our annual auction. ELL parents not only  attend these events with their children, but also volunteer to assist with them. The PTA has formed a sub-committee  specifically designed to support International Families in connecting with the community. They meet regularly to plan  activities  and connect new families with those that may have recently made a similar transition.  The parents of new ELLs are  invited to an Orientation with the ESL teacher as soon as it is determined that a child is an ELL.  Parents keep in touch with the  ESL teacher via email, informal meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences, progress reports, and an ESL website which provides  updates on classroom activities.  In addition to the ESL teacher, parents of ELLs are kept informed of their child’s activities  through their classroom teachers, as well as monthly Family Fridays and Open School Week when parents can visit and  participate in their child’s classes.  Furthermore, the Parent Coordinator keeps our parents informed of important dates and  opportunities for children and parents to attend events hosted by the NYC DOE Office of ELLs.  The Parent Coordinator also  reaches out to ELL parents before meetings to assess their language needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         The school relies first on the Home Language Identification Survey to identify the written and oral interpretation needs of our  families.   Families indicate in what language they would prefer to communicate verbally and in writing on the second page of  the survey.  In addition to this initial assessment, all staff involved in the registration process (including the ESL teacher and  Parent Coordinator) speak with families (and would use the NYCDOE Translation Office if it ever became necessary) to gather  information about communication preferences and needs.        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Adele Schroeter, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS59                                                                              School DBN: 02M059  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      PS 59 relies on the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to identify the written translation and oral  interpretation needs of our families. When completing the second page of the HLIS, families indicate their  language of preference when communicating verbally with school staff and when receiving written information  from the school. In addition to this self-provided information by the parent, staff involved in the registration  process (including the ESL teacher and Parent Coordinator) meet with families and speak with them to gather  information about communication preferences and needs. Other methods of data collection are also considered,  including the ATS Report of Preferred Languages, Blue Card data, Parent Surveys, and teachers' class surveys.  When necessary, the school uses the NYCDOE Translation Office to make contact with parents who do not speak  English. If parents indicate a preferred language for written or oral communication that is other than English, we  keep track of those requests in a spreadsheet that indicates the class and grade of the student, along with the  requested language for written or oral communication. Although many families at PS 59 speak languages other  than English at home, parents historically prefer to communicate in English.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    If parents indicate PS 59 has  families of both ELLs and  non-ELLs that represent  over 31 language  backgrounds. Despite this  diversity of languages, most  of our parents prefer to  communicate in English  both orally and in writing,  and are able to do so, or  have close family members  who regularly assist them  with translation and  interpretation needs. Our  needs assessment findings  this year showed that  parents of newly enrolled  students so far this year  have requested  communication in English. If  parents of students who  enroll later in the year  request communication in  another language, this  information would be  communicated by the ESL  teacher to the students'  classroom teachers and  service providers where  applicable, as well as to the  Parent Coordinator, by  referring to the second  page of the HLIS. In the  past, the few parents that  have needed translation  and interpretation services  have also expressed their  preference that older  siblings (age 18+) or other  relatives and family friends  assist them with the  translating of English  communications, as  opposed to an outside  person.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64             3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.

Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.

Parents at PS 59 are very active and involved, not only in their children's academic lives, but also in school events and  activities. The Parent Coordinator supports this strong parent base and plays an integral role in assisting families of  English Language Learners. Our Parent Coordinator facilitates connections between same-language families, so they  can act as mentors and support for each other, and utilizes our multilingual staff to assist with communication. To  ensure that the school is in compliance with Chancellor's Regulation A-663 (Translations), our Parent Coordinator  ensures that parents know about the translation and interpretation services available. She posts signs in various  languages to let families know about services offered in multiple languages, such as homework help. The Parent  Coordinator provides information about our website and its translation features, and arranges for translation of  documents as needed. She seeks outside sources if a family has a language need that is beyond that which the NYC  DOE provides, ensuring that all families, ELL or non-ELL, have access to the information parents need to support their  child and foster their academic success.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive.
