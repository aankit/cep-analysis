This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The Mission of P.S. 163Q is to engage all students in learning experiences that build upon their strengths and natural  curiosities. We believe that each and every student is special and unique enabling us to better understand and nurture  their gifts. With parents, teachers and all staff members working side by side, we will create an engaging, rigorous  environment where students are able to talk about their thinking, challenge their ideas, grow new ideas and put their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      thoughts into action. Through this collaboration we are creating a body of learners that will have the skills to be the  change agents of today’s world. Our students will “USE THEIR MINDS TO CREATE CHANGE.”            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 163Q is an Elementary School located in the heart of Flushing, Queens. As a neighborhood school, PS 163 services  almost 850 students across grades Pre-K -5. Public School 163 is a welcoming environment that services a diverse  community of learners and families.      To ensure the success of the PS 163Q learning community, we have adopted the mantra “Using Our Minds to Create  Change”. This mantra summarizes our school’s mission and our belief about how students learn best.      Through our side-by-side Mandarin Dual Language Program we are able to create an environment where the  language and culture of our students are celebrated, revered and used as a scaffold to ensure their academic success.  Our program also supports families who would like to acquire a second language through immersing themselves in  the culture, language and academic demands of the Mandarin DL program. This provides a forum for all students to  be celebrated as they learn from one another. The school also provides a range or Enrichment and Arts opportunities  for its students through partnerships with Young Runners, Inside Broadway, Suparc Inc, Cool Culture, Shadowbox  Theater and the Queens Botanical Gardens.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   As a diverse community of learners our goal is to ensure all students have access to an engaging curricula that is  aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Currently our school population consists of 50% of students  identified as English Language Learners and 14% of student’s that have IEPs. Our charge has been to strengthen and  deepen our content knowledge of our students and how they learn best, so we can provide the appropriate supports,  strategies and scaffolds to ensure that they’re successful. It is important that each and every student is provided an  equal opportunity to engage in rigorous learning tasks. This is a direct result of teacher and administrative teams  deepening their knowledge about each and every student that we serve. Although PS 163 has had great success in  this area, we’d like to continue to build upon this work as a next step to further grow, deepen and strengthen our  practice.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools Report 2018 identifies that PS 163 is highly effective in the area of rigorous  instruction. In the areas of effective school leadership, collaborative teachers, strong community ties and trust, we are  effective.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 25Q163   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   804   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  To recruit Highly Qualified Teachers the school has developed partnerships with Columbia University, St. John’s  University and Queens College. Students enrolled in the teacher education programs at these colleges are able to  complete student teaching residencies and classroom observations at our site. This enables student teachers to  engage in on-going professional development provided at the school level supporting the transfer of teaching  methodology to real practice. This also helps the school when hiring and recruiting Highly Qualified Teacher’s to  support our learning goals.           2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All teachers currently on staff are deemed Highly Qualified. The team will continue to support teacher growth through  the Inquiry Process, Professional Development Opportunities and utilizing the Charlotte Danielson framework as a  tool for providing feedback and identifying next steps and best teaching practices. This work will also support the  school in retaining Highly Qualified Teachers. Paraprofessionals will take part in teacher PD sessions and city-wide PD  sessions to support paraprofessionals.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  The school holds parent open-house workshops run by school administration, the Parent Coordinator, and Guidance  Counselor. These workshops include visits to the classrooms, informational sessions regarding preparing your child for  Kindergarten and workshops that focus on the Common Core Standards students will engage with in Grade K. This  summer the school will add an additional workshop outlining specific academic benchmarks parents can begin to  support their children with to give them a head start with the expectations and goals of Kindergarten. The Guidance  Counselor and Parent Coordinator will also hold a separate session explicitly for parents to prepare them for the  transition they will face as their children take this next step and ways they can respond to support them.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     This year the school Instructional Cabinet comprised of teaches from all grades, anENL provider, Special Education  Provider and administrators met to review current assessment practices and its alignment in measuring the CCLS. The  team will meet after school to determine which Local Assessments would be reflective of the learning communities’  beliefs about how students learn and truly provide a measure of each student’s progress with the CCLS. The team will  meet 4 times during the year to measure the effectiveness of current assessment practices alongside the selected  local assessments. The SWIT (School-Wide) Instructional Team) will engage in this work at well. SWIT will continue the  work of the Local Assessment Team as their work is directly aligned.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 163Q in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 163Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy, math,  and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

In the  2016 NYSESLAT, 49% of our students showed gains of at least one level, 43% of the students  remained at the same level, and 7% decreased by one level. The 2017 EDAT data reveals that  46% showed gains of at least one level, 51% remained at the same level, and 3% decreased by  one level. We noticed that in the first grade, 10% of the students   increased of one level, 68%  remained at the same level and 21% decreased by one level. We also noticed that the writing  modality is the first area of need and speaking modality is the second area of need in grades 1- 5.  The EDAT also reveals that 18 students have an at-risk level of 3 or greater in grades 3-5.  In the spring of 2019, ENL students in grades 1-5 will be offered an opportunity to participate in  an 8 session Saturday morning test prep program starting in February and ending in  April, from  8:30-10:30, where they will work closely with six ENL or bilingual licensed teacher to further  develop their speaking, listening reading or writing skills. The six content area teachers will  co- teach by rotating in small groups with the ENL/bilingual teacher. The students will be grouped  by weakest modality and will use the Finish Line New York ENL test prep book. The teachers  will record attendance on each scheduled session. The parents will be informed of the program  and any other information in their native language using the Translation and Interpretation unit.  All records will be maintained in room 433 and stored in a locked file cabinet.        The district's math goal is to implement a "Theory of Action" in mathematics to deepen student's  conceptual understanding and problems solving skills. We are aligned with this goal  by  targeting the lowest 2% in grades K-2. In the fall of 2018, P.S. 163 will begin a partnership  with Project BRIDGE, through St.John's University. All ENL students in kindergarten will be  invited to participate in a three year project. The students will participate in a before school math  program starting in October of 2018 and ending in May of 2021. The teachers will receive  training on applying math strategies that are differentiated by attending classes at  St.John's.  Students will have an opportunity to develop math and English proficiency.   The  program will start at 7:00 a.m. and end at 7:55 from Monday- Friday. The students will work  with two licensed ENL teacher's. The parents will be informed of the program and any other  information in their native language using the Translation and Interpretation unit.

Their  focus will be to look at different vocabulary building strategies to help their students acquire  language. They will plan and infuse differentiation in their lessons for all language levels and  record their strategies on their literacy curriculum maps.  All teachers will reflect on their work  at the culminating session by presenting data on two students they tracked during the course of  the work.  This work will take place after school on a Tuesday or Wednesday from December  through February for two-hour sessions on nine days, with six ESL/Bilingual teachers.

We will invite parents by sending invitations in their native language.  We will have six licensed ESL teacher's  who will assist the families in coding. We will have  various staff members providing translation to support the activities in the preferred language.  We will purchase 60 Ipads and robotics equipment.  We will notify the parents by sending letters  in the preferred language. All participants will sign an attendance sheet for each session.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data to determine the level of language proficiency in order to place the student. This data  is also used to help the teacher form groups for differentiated instruction.   Wonders running records (DRA), Wonders benchmark and unit assessments, Wonders weekly assessments, one on one and  small group conferences with ELL students, daily observations of ELL students in the classroom setting. For our Dual Language  program, the teachers create their own assessments in literacy and in Math.                 2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Teachers collaborate with each other, the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher work together to create lessons based on  the ENL students’ needs. Lessons are differentiated based on what is needed for the ENL students at various levels of language  acquisition.  Results of student data are shared among teachers through the use of Dropbox as well as conversations at grade  level meetings.  Professional development is given to the staff regarding ELL language development and testing.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  NYSITELL, NYSELAT, NYC Performance Tasks, NY STATE ELA and Math Exams, MOSL, 4th grade Science test and the NYC  Chinese Reading Test.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Through looking at the EDAT we identify students who are at a risk level of 4 or greater.  They get first priority to all TITLE III  programs.  In addition, in grades 3-5, students are invited to ELA and Math afterschool test prep.  Within our literacy  curriculum, teachers use recommended interventions to support each group's needs.  Children are assigned individual work  that is based on the assessments through the digital portion of the Wonders program which they can access at  home.   Another structure is Family Math Night where the parents learn how to support their children in understanding the  math curriculum.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We use Tier 1 to incorporate high quality evidence- based instruction for all students. This includes instruction that has been  shown to be effective fro ELLs, and differentiation to meet students diverse needs. Instruction for ENL students in English  language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level. Students move into Tier 2 if they demonstrate a need for  more targeted and intensive academic support. This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate settings  with instruction focused on specific learning target. Tier 2 instruction should also be tailored to meet ENL students language  needs through small group instruction and should be incorporated into research-based intervention strategies.   We use data  to guide instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework by having classroom teachers collect individual information on all  students. Teachers use conference notes and running records to determine the reading level of the student.  The teacher then  uses this data to drive instruction for each student by creating small groups and incorporating UDL. They can modify the  curriculum by repeating or changing the order of lessons, tailoring the lesson presentation to draw upon the learning strengths  of the students, and pairing the students with peers who can assist them in the classroom.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSITELL, NYSELAT, Wonders benchmark and unit assessments, Wonders running records, NY State ELA and MATH exam,  MOSL, NYC Performance Tasks, reading and writing conferences, exit slips, turn and talk opportunities, and teacher  observation notes.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ENL teachers print and share the RLAT results with the classroom teachers, clearly identifying which students are ELLS and the  required number of minutes of ENL per week.  We also share the EDAT report during weekly grade level conferences so  teachers can learn the at-risk levels of all of their students.  Teachers use this data to form small groups for all lessons. In  addition, our grouping of students for our AIS periods are formed by looking at data.  Teachers can utilize this information in  order to target student weakness in ELA , Math and the four language modalities on the NYSESLAT.          Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           P.S. 163 has a Push-In and Pull-Out program with heterogeneous grouping. If an ELL is identified as Entering or  Emerging they are mandated to have 360 minutes of service. The 360 minutes are divided, with 180 minutes devoted  to standalone ENL and 180 minutes devoted to integrated ENL in all content areas. . If an ELL is identified as  Transitioning or Expanding, they receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL in all content areas. . If a students reaches the  Commanding level, they are required to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in all content areas.  For students  identified as Entering or Transitioning, there is flexibility in the minimum number of minutes in standalone or  integrated ENL in all content areas.  During the integrated model, instruction is in the content areas. We teach math,  social studies, science and ELA to all ELLs for 180 minutes a week. For commanding students, we teach them for 90  minutes a week.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We will open 2 TBE Kindergarten classes in 2017-2018 school year.  One is a special education self  contained  Mandarin Kindergarten, the other is a TBE Mandarin general education Kindergarten.   At the entering  level, TBE students are expected to receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English.  As a  student's English proficiency increases, more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English.  When  determining the amount of home language and English language use and instruction, teachers should consider a  number of factors including, but not limited to, students' proficiency levels, educational backgrounds, content  knowledge, and home language literacy skills.  This allows for differentiated instruction that meets the individual  students' needs.  As students develop English language skills, time in the home language decreases.  When ELLs reach  commanding on the NYSESLAT, they are placed in a monolingual class in English, with home language supports.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.          In our dual language program, we use a 50/50 model, with 360 minutes of Native Language Arts and  bilingual instruction given.  Students are serviced by a licensed bilingual and an ENL teacher on the English side.  On  the English side of the program, the teacher uses Reading Wonders as the literacy curriculum and Go Math as the  math curriculum.  On the Mandarin side, the teachers translate the curriculum by aligning the skills to the program's  target language.  The teachers use Go Math by translating the content to create their lessons.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              In our dual language program, we use a 50/50 HLA, with 360 minutes of NL and integrated instruction given in one of the  four content areas.  For students who receive their  mandated 180 minutes in integrated instruction. In our ENL program, if an  ELL is identified as Beginner/Entering or Low Intermediate/Transitioning they are mandated to have 360 minutes of service.  The 360 minutes are divided, with 180 minutes devoted to standalone ENL and 180 minutes devoted to integrated ENL in one  of the four content areas. If an ELL is identified as Intermediate/Transitioning or Advanced/Expanding, they receive 180  minutes of integrated ENL in one of the four content areas.  If a students reaches the Proficient/Commanding level, they are  required to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in one of the four content areas. . For students identified as Low  Intermediate/Entering or Intermediate/Transitioning, there is flexibility in the minimum number of minutes in standalone or  integrated ENL in one of the four content areas. .       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                 The content areas are delivered in each program model by using the six types of scaffolding techniques which include  modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, text re-presentation, and metacognition. Teachers at P.S. 163 use  these techniques in the following ways. When modeling, our teachers demonstrate what they want the student to do first, or  complete the task together. When teachers use bridging as a technique, they allow students to access their prior knowledge in  order to make a connection to the current lesson. Through contextualization, our teachers provides visual support that the  student can understand when language is not enough. Schema building is critical when learning a new concept for the first  time. Our teachers allow students to preview information by using graphic organizers to gather information in pieces in order  to understand the whole. When using text re-presentation, students get an opportunity to use academic language by  presenting it in another fashion either orally or in written form. Our teachers show the students how to use metacognition by  teaching them multiple strategies that they can apply when performing a task. The students are allowed this ability because  the teachers have taught strategies within the scaffolding techniques that students can rely on. The current innovations in  content area study all involve the New York State standards. Teachers' increase rigor in their lessons through Depths of  Knowledge (DOK) by challenging their students through DOK 3 and 4 levels. The Mary Ann Cucchiara workshops provide the  city with the latest strategies that help support language development for the CCLS. The strategies include, juicy sentences,  deconstruct/reconstruct, conversation frames for cause and effect, paragraph frames for summarizing chapters, and academic  language frames to add tier three and four words when writing and speaking  3-          In each model program the materials vary by subject. In ELA, we use Reading Wonders as our literacy curriculum, which  includes a word study component.  In social studies we are using the NYC Passport program.   In math, all programs use Go  Math, which includes workbooks and a media component that gives all the students a visual model. In science, all classes use  the Science Fusion program.   Hands-on experiments are conducted  in the science lab as well as in the classroom.  All lessons  are conducted in English. In our dual language and TBE programs, the language of instruction is Mandarin.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    As students enter our school, the Spanish Lab is administered to Spanish speaking students who are identified as ELLs.  In our  Dual Language program, in grades 3-5, students take the NYC Chinese reading test each Spring.  In our K-5 Chinese dual  language classes, we informally assess throughout the year to determine the students' strengths in their native language by  using running records, end of unit assessments in math, individual conferences, small group instruction, and guided reading  groups.   All grade 3-5 Ells are given the option of taking the mathematics or science state exams in their native language.  We  also distribute glossaries in various languages in order for students to understand all exam questions.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status         a. We differentiate instruction for ELL subgroups through the following programs and strategies. The school supports SIFE  students by first informing the classroom teacher that the student has had interrupted formal education. The child is then  afforded all the services which includes the Saturday test prep program, and small group instruction with the F-Status  provider. The student is also taught in their native language, were applicable. We understand that a SIFE student can have  intensive social and emotional needs. They can show withdrawal or display aggressive behavior in the classroom. Therefore,  we provide guidance services to help the student get adjusted to his/her new environment.E       Through our social and emotional school wide program, EAR Time (Emotions, Actions, Response), groups of students are  meeting with various staff members as a way to build trust.  During EAR Time, students can talk about any topic and the staff  member listens and guides when appropriate.  One of the goals is to allow the students to recognize that there are people  other than their classroom teacher that they can go to and confide in. within the school community.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      b. In addition to their 360 mandated minutes, we offer the newcomers a six-week vestibule program in grades K-5. These  students are introduced to basic survival vocabulary and important phrases like, “Can I please go to the bathroom?” The  program also involves touring the different parts of the school in order for the students to become familiar with their  surroundings.   c. At P.S. 163 we do everything possible to prevent Long Term ELLs (LTE). We are working on ways to improve how we teach  ELLs in years 4-6 by considering new programs aimed at improving ELLs at risk for reading problems. Through the Response to  Intervention program (RTI), the Pupil Personal Team (PPT) discusses students who are struggling in academic or behavioral  areas to find what strategies or interventions can be implemented. The team will then devise a plan to provide services which  may include at risk speech, SETSS or counseling which will be delivered for a specified period of time.   d. Our plan to service long-term ELLs are as follows. First we look at data including the NYSESLAT, ELA, and unit assessments to  find the students' weaknesses. We will invite them to all Title III activities which will promote language acquisition.  Currently,  we do not have any long-term ELLs.   e. Former ELLs get 90 minutes a week of mandated ENL services for two years. They receive Academic Intervention Services  (AIS), and content area support,  They also are eligible for test accommodations such as time extensions, separate location,  and the use of bilingual dictionaries.   The Former ELLs/ current ELLs receive testing accommodations for up to two years by receiving time and a half, native  language glossary,  and separate location                6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           P.S. 163 strives to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment. In order to meet the needs of  grade level curriculum we look at their IEP’s, focusing on their present levels of performance and goals in order to understand  their diverse needs. By understanding that all students learn differently we can assess which learning style hones in on their  strengths and develop lessons that cater to them. We have ICT classrooms in grades K-5. Special Education teachers also  provide SETSS instruction in grades K-5. We use the Wonder Works program by Reading Wonders, to support literacy  development. Students also have access to technology by using Ipads to perform activities in our literacy and math programs.        Through a LEAP grant awarded to us this year, we are accelerating English language development for our ELL-SWDs in lower  grades.  Through this 36 session program, the students are being introduced to many art forms, including music, dance, and  the visual arts, to promote language growth.  The grant also includes professional development at the Metropolitan Museum  of Art for all the teachers involved.  Also, the students will visit the museum to connect their work with artists and their various  pieces.  Lastly, the school will host an assembly for the parents to take part in their students' work through the creation of an  "on the spot" mural.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?          Our school achieves IEP and English proficiency goals for ELL-SWDs by providing the following support:           Curricular- Depending on the students needs, there is room for modifications. Teachers can teach at a slower pace and  redo lessons the next day if students do not succeed at the first attempt. They can tweak the curriculum depending on the  student's success. Teachers can use trade books that are on the student’s level to reach goals such as retelling of stories.           Instructional- Teachers meet with students 1:1 and in small groups. The teacher changes the instructional strategies and  simplifies/modifies them in order to achieve the same intended outcomes. For example, pictorial support, modifying the  amount of input/prompting given to students, and longer time frame for teachers to teach. The classrooms are equipped with  Promethean boards. This technology helps students answer questions by supporting them with pictures, words, video clips,  and oral presentations.     Scheduling Flexibility- Within the least restrictive environment in mind, we look to move students who are succeeding into a  less restrictive setting.  For example, if students are doing well in ELA or math, we offer a less restrictive classroom for that  area of study.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention programs for ELA, math and other content areas are as follow:   Newcomers- Title III Afterschool and Saturday programs, which include math and NYESLAT test prep. AIS support in ELA and  math throughout the year.   Developing ELLs- Title III Afterschool and Saturday programs which include ELA, math, and NYSESLAT test prep  programs. AIS support in ELA and math throughout the year.   Long-Term ELLs- Title III Afterschool and Saturday programs which include ELA, math, and NYSESLAT test prep  programs. AIS support in ELA and math throughout the year.   ELL students with disabilities- Title III Afterschool and Saturday programs which include ELA, math, and NYSESLAT test prep  programs.  AIS support in ELA and math throughout the year.   SIFE- Title III Afterschool and Saturday programs which include ELA, math, and NYSESLAT test prep programs. AIS support in  ELA and math throughout the year.   Former ELLs- Title III Afterschool and Saturday programs which include ELA, math, and NYSESLAT test prep  programs. AIS support in ELA and math throughout the year.   All programs are offered in English. Dual language students in grades K-5 are offered content taught in English and Mandarin.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       Based on last year’s parent selection forms, we opened up a Kindergarten TBE program for the current school year.  The latest  parent selection forms indicated a continued trend for this type of Kindergarten class.  24 surveys indicated interest in TBE, so  we will continue this program for September 2018.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not make any changes for this school year.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.      Ells are afforded equal access to all programs. Letters are sent home in the parents preferred language that describes the  program and all the details for attending.  ELLs of all NYSITELL and NYSESLAT levels are offered these programs. All Title III  programs are for ELLs only. Parents are again notified through the parent preferred language.    We have begun using the “school messenger” robo-call system.  Phone calls are made to parents in their home language (as  indicated on ATS) regarding school programs and important schoolwide information.  Throughout the year, our school has offered a variety of after school and weekend programming available to our ELL  students.  Parents are notified through their preferred language. These include:       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Each classroom in the school has a Promethean Board that is used with all of our students including our ELLs. In addition, we  have six mobile carts with laptops of which all teachers, including our ENL teachers, have access to. Classrooms have been  provided with 2 IPads each and in addition, there is a mobile cart with Ipads for all to use.  We have leveled libraries available  for all of our students including our ELLs to check out books on their independent reading levels. We have hands on tools such  manipulatives for use in mathematics instruction. In addition, the following materials are used to support the learning of ELLs –  computer software, thesauruses, picture dictionaries (Oxford and Longman) with accompanying CDs, bilingual  dictionaries,  Wonders guided reading books, Big Books, Paired books (fiction and nonfiction about the same topic), anchor  charts, sentence frames, word walls, shades of meaning word walls,  classroom library of picture books, chapter books, poetry,  science, social studies and math books, games and maps.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      How language is assessed by visiting  classrooms and looking for the following: materials accessible to students, rich- print  charts, anchor charts and authentic student work. We also communicate with teachers about their needs for language  support. This is conducted in all of our programs.   Throughout the self contained and Free Standing ENL programs, ELLs are given the opportunity to express themselves in their  native language when needed through their writing. When incoming ELLs arrive from other countries, we try to team them up  with students who speak their language. We want our ELLs to feel comfortable and confident in asking questions and  expressing themselves. We also have bilingual dictionaries and bilingual libraries available for their use. In the Dual Language  program, students are encouraged to express themselves in the native language orally and in writing.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our English Language Learners are given their required ENL service support in relation to their ages and current grade level.  They are given bilingual texts, glossaries and translation services when necessary. In addition, instruction is differentiated in  order to meet each child's individual needs as they strive towards both English proficiency as well as meeting their grade's  curriculum requirements.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We have a district wide Title III summer school program for ELLs in grades 3-5 . We give newly enrolled ELL students the  opportunity to come to our school during the summer and familiarize themselves with both P.S. 163Q as well as provide them  with educational opportunities during the summer months. The ENL coordinator, parent coordinator and administration are  involved in these activities. New ELLs who enroll throughout the school year may participate in the previously listed residency  programs.   A Pre-K and Kindergarten parent orientation are held prior to the beginning of the school year.                17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are offered at this time.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   P.S.163Q’s Dual Language side-by-side English-Mandarin program consists of 300 children in grades K-5.  Language instruction employs a 50-50 model. The classrooms are distinguished by color. Red is for  Mandarin and Blue for English. We follow the standard New York City curriculum for instruction. The  English and Mandarin curricula complement each other through the alignment of the Reading Wonders  Literacy program. This allows students to utilize what they are familiar with in the Native Language  classroom to the application of the learning in the second language classroom. We also offer a project-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         based learning environment.   The students learn the core academic areas in both English and Mandarin to develop academic  proficiency. The class make-up consists of English proficient students and Mandarin proficient students  based on home language who are English Language Learners. Students are integrated for the entire day.  Literacy instruction in English and Mandarin alternate daily. Word study/Phonics, and math are  alternated daily in both languages as well.  Students are taught  the content in Science and Social Studies  in English.  Science and Social Studies Mandarin materials are insufficient to deliver instruction in  Mandarin at this time.  Although materials are lacking in these two content areas, teachers do use L1  supports to make the content more comprehensible.  In an effort to help students develop an appreciation and respect for cultural diversity, students receive  an additional instruction of culture.  Students in the dual language program participate in a Lunar New  Year performance through creating authentic crafts,  learning traditional songs and dances and wearing  costumes representing the Chinese culture. During this time, students are integrated for cross-cultural  studies and activities. Our Mandarin instruction is delivered using Traditional Characters, in order to build  a foundational system for learning. As students progress through this program, they will be introduced to  Simplified Characters.           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?       P.S. 163 provides many opportunities for ENLteachers to learn the latest methodology. Our ENL coordinator holds training in  NYSESLAT test prep strategies for ELL teachers during grade conferences, as well as disseminating the latest NYS learning  strategies.  Teachers also receive training on how to administer the NYSITELL to incoming students.    Another workshop will teach all teachers how to identify Ells going through the process of language acquisition vs a learning  disability.  Also, we will have a workshop  helping teachers in the mainstream classroom who have ELLs.      There will be monthly Reading Wonders Professional Development for all the teachers.  Through the PD, teachers will learn  how to differentiate instruction and locate resources that will help all learners.  In addition, there will be Professional  Development for all teachers on understanding the EDAT data.  This PD will occur in September 2017 at each grade meeting.      Our non-pedagogical staff receive training at the district office. For example, our parent coordinator attends monthly  workshops to support the families in the community. Our guidance counselor receives social/emotional training to share with  the staff and her children. Our school secretary attends workshops on procedures for registering students.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   The school also provides training to teachers of ELL students who are transitioning from elementary school into middle school.  The teachers are given workshops by the guidance counselor on the various forms the teachers and students need to fill out.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Procedures are gone over with the teachers who are recommending ELL students to specialized programs or schools. Teachers  are aware of the translation help that is available from our staff (Chinese).     We meet the 15% ELL professional development for all teachers through the following activities. One workshop will teach all  teachers how to identify Ells  going through the process of language acquisition vs a learning disability.  Also, we will have a  workshop  helping teachers in the mainstream classroom who have ELLs. The course provides an overview of ELLs instructional  needs, and offers a variety of research-based strategies and techniques that support their academic development and social  integration. Participants will explore ways in which instruction and assessment can be adapted to not only benefit the ELLs but  the class as a whole. They will develop activities that promote language development and acquisition and engage students  socially and academically.      During the grades' sixth prep, teachers are sharing strategies for multiple subgroups including ESL.  They incorporate the  strategies into their curriculum maps as best practices.  In addition, we will concentrate on the study of helping our ELLs learn  content. Teachers will learn how to balance the dual focus on language and subject matter, and also learn a helpful framework  for designing content-based classes and lessons. Teacher teams will examine different criteria for choosing and developing the  content to teach, as well as factors influencing the choice, development, and adaptation of materials. They will learn several  useful activity types and how to integrate listening, speaking, reading, and writing in content-based instruction with students  at different proficiency levels.  Records will be kept by keeping an attendance record and agenda. Also, the teachers will  submit a form indicating items that were applied to their curriculum maps at each meeting.    Our ENL/bilingual  teachers receive 50% professional development by attending  workshops specified for ENL students. In  addition, Monday PD days provide an opportunity for workshops to be held in-house.     At the beginning of the year, our ENL Coordinator presented a workshop on how to read and analyze the RLAT report, so that  teachers knew how to identify their ELLs, and understand their current proficiency level, and how they scored on the latest  NYSESLAT (or NYSITELL) exam.  Our Assistant Principal also gave a presentation and showed a video about translation and  interpretation.     Several teachers attended a series of workshops with MaryAnn Cucchiara.  They turn-keyed this information to the entire staff  on Monday, March 5th.  They provided all teachers with ELL strategies to help in the teaching of academic language.    During testing time, the ENL Coordinator presented two PD’s.  One was best practices for test sophistication (March 13th),  explaining what the NYSESLAT exam comprises, and how to best prepare students to take this test.  The second one was how  to properly proctor the exam.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Teachers make appointments throughout the year to discuss all students work, progress, next steps, exams, and language  needs. The teachers use the T&I unit for over the phone translation.  The teachers work around the parents schedule when  arranging appointments.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We have a parent coordinator who is an important part of our community. She is responsible for:  As a member of the school staff supervised by the school principal, the parent coordinator partners with and supports the  work of their Parent Association/Parent Teacher Association, School Leadership Team, community groups, and parent advisory   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         councils. She outreaches to all families regardless of language to become involved in the school's environment, especially by  volunteering and serving on SLT and committees.     We have translations services available through our staff who speak Mandarin and Spanish. We use the translation  unit for  support in any other language. As much material as possible goes home in our three major languages, English, Chinese and  Spanish.       School leaders and staff will engage families to support teaching and learning through:      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    In our Dual Language program, the teachers create all the materials.  NYC lacks Mandarin based materials in all content areas.                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Francine Marsaggi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 163                                                                              School DBN: 25Q163  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We use the RHLA and RAPL reports on ATS to ensure communication via phone or mail represents the parents  language. We also view PART III of the HLIS, to know in what language parents prefer to receive written notices.  The HLIS also informs us of what language parents would prefer to speak to school staff. The translated student  emergency cards help us identify the language spoken by the parent.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      During emergencies we write a letter home explaining the situation. We translate the letter using staff members who  speak the preferred languages. If the school needs to evacuate, all teachers bring a ROCL to call the parents using the  T&I unit.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff members are required to sign that they have read all Chancellors regulation, including A-663 on their first  reporting day of the school year. Our LAC holds professional development every September to the entire staff on how  to ue the T&I services. All staff members will send letters to be translated in the preferred language to our secretary,  which in-turn, the letters will be sent to T&I. We will send our LAC to T&I periodic training on the language access  requirements. Our ENL teachers determine the primary language spoken by the parent at registration. This  information is located on the students blue emergency card. Parents are notified through the following ways: A copy  of the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities which include their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in  the preferred language. In our lobby we have a welcome poster informing the families of the preferred languages.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Lastly, our security guard has a welcome card where the parents can point to in order to identify their preferred  language.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      P.S. 163 welcomes all parents in a friendly non-threatening manner. The parents view the welcome poster as soon as  they step through the door. We give every parent a Bill of Rights, Language Access Guide, and have access to the  Language ID Guide. All letters sent home for events will be translated in the preferred language.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will gather information formally and informally. We give parents surveys in order to find out how they feel about  the school, events in the school, staff and administration, safety, and curriculum. We also speak to parents every  chance we get to get their feedback about on the spot activities and concerns.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70
