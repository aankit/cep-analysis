This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 41’s motto is “Believe and Achieve”. We believe that all students at PS 41 can show improvement academically  and socially. This is reflected in our school mission, which states, “At P.S. 41, we nurture and serve every child to be  productive citizens while reaching their highest potential."      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 41 is an academic home that promotes and nurtures each child’s social and emotional development. We improve  student achievement through collaboration, differentiated and rigorous instruction. P.S. 41 is a place where students  are held accountable for their own learning by establishing realistic and measurable goals that encourage all students  to become critical thinkers and problem solvers. P.S. 41 has a learning culture in which staff members are relationship  managers that project positively and have a holistic and a shared approach to learning. Staff and students will  participate and use Brain Power and R.U.L.E.R in and outside of the classrooms. The Ruler Approach helps staff and  students identify emotions through self-awareness and self reflection. Brain Power gives staff and students the  tools(exercises and activities) to enhance ones mood. The school staff values proactive problem solving and embraces  the learning process, not just its outcome. Staff members hold themselves and each other accountable in their  commitment to P.S. 41’s mission.       At P.S. 41 we have approximately 867 students. Below you can see the student population breakdown.   Black (429)  Hispanic (392)  Asian (15)  White (24)  Free Lunch  SWD (152)  ELL (99)  Title   49.48%   45.21%   1.73%   2.76%   98%   17.18%   11.4%  98%       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At P.S. 41 eleven percent of our students are English Language Learners. Recently, we have learned through data  collection that a vast majority of English Language Learners are the bottom ten percent of students on each grade.  The ELL staff needs to develop systems that constantly assess the students and modify their instruction based on  student’s specific needs. English Language Learners are a targeted population that would benefit from individual goals  as well as differentiated classroom instruction and homework assignments. Also at PS 4.1 our Students with  disabilities is a targeted population. We track tracking individual IEP goals, using our progress monitoring structures  making sure high frequency progress monitoring is being made that will hopefully impact achievement. ELL teachers  and Special Education teachers have data talks, set goals and create actions plans for the students.             4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Progress    By the end of the 2017-2018 school year there was no change in our data for "strong family community ties" of  Frameworks for Great Schools. The goal during this school year was to increase parent participation in school wide  events and enhance parental relationships within the school. In order to reach this goal teachers, staff and  administration used different resources to communicate with parents such as REMIND, Pupil Path, and School  Messenger. Families also received monthly newsletters, access to teacher websites, face book, and parent  engagement/communication time every Tuesday.       Key Areas Of Focus   According to the data, there was a .24% decrease in collaborative teachers , and a .23% decrease in effective school  leadership. Due to the decrease in two major areas we will have determined these areas as our priority . Across the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      school we have teachers participating in professional learning workshops focused on assessment in instruction,  teachers participate in inter visitation to facilitate conversation on best practices and teachers attend and lead weekly  PLC meetings. Administrators will provide specific feedback during post observations and schedule different  professional development both inside and outside District 11. Also, the principal meets with each individual staff  member in the school to see what needs they may require to be and feel successful.                   2017-2018 Multi-Year School Quality Summary  2016  `2017  2018   Rigorous Instruction   Collaborative Teachers    Supportive Environment   Effective School Leadership   Strong Family-Community Ties    Trust    4.58  4.44  4.41   4.58  4.79  4.55   4.07  3.66  N/A   4.70  4.74  4.51   4.19  4.40  4.40   4.49  4.53  4.47         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X041   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   920   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Student work products and discussions reflect high levels of  student thinking, participation, and ownership. For example, classroom visits demonstrated teachers differentiating  instruction, providing opportunities for student discussion and students engaging in rigorous activities during inter- visitation and school visits. As a school we strived to be as cohesive as possible creating reading memos specially for  our 10-10-10 model, running lab sites so teachers could observe best practices and overall being goal oriented in  reading, writing and math.    Priority Needs   According to the data, one priority need is in math instruction especially in the fifth grade where there was a 4%  decrease. To help with this priority need we embraced the initiative of Algebra For All and departmentalization. We  have sent teachers and administrators to Algebra For All Professional Development. Two other priority needs are our  ELL students and Students With Disabilities            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

We  offer parent workshops once a month during the school year and parent attendance is between forty and fifty  parents. We service approximately eight hundred fifty students. When we hosted a parent association meeting we  had over eighty parents in attendance. We learned that parents would prefer to support their students and volunteer  their time rather than coming to their child’s school for a workshop.    In November 2017, we hosted a Thanksgiving Feast where approximately 600 parents attended. In May 2018, we had  over 80 parents attend Career day and approximately 685 parents attend the student-led presentation during open  school night.       According to the data there was no change in parental involvement in the school from this year to last year.   The more parents that attend the events we host then we will develop stronger family and community ties. When  parents are involved in the development of their child's education students become more aware of how important it  is to go to school. The administrative team analyzed performance data of students whose parents are heavily involved  here at P.S. 41 compared to students whose parents are not as involved. We tracked the involvement of the parents  and compared it to student performance and learned that those students scored either a 3 or 4 on either the ELA and  Math state exams.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  At P.S. 41, we host Kindergarten Orientations twice a year inviting the students and parents to the school. During  these sessions we share with parent’s kindergarten expectations. To help both parents and preschool children  transition we provide them with a packet of activities that would prepare students for Kindergarten. At this time  parents meet the Kindergarten teachers who review classroom routines and ways to help their children adjust.    We have developed a partnership with Mind Builders who have a early childhood program. During the school year the  preschool teachers from Mind Builders will meet with the Kindergarten teachers from P.S. 41. This joint PD will help  build an open communication between the Kindergarten teachers and the early childhood teachers at Mind Builders.  Teachers will gather data and support one another to develop best teaching practices that will benefit their students.   We also have a partnership with Parent Corp who specifically hosts classes for parents of students who are in early  childhood programs and Kindergarten. Parent Corp helps parents transition their children into school and provide  activities for them to do with their children at home.           4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     At P.S. 41 we have an assessment team that creates the assessment calendar for each school year. There is one  representative on the team from each grade. The member of the assessment team meet with the members of the  grade to discuss the assessments that will be used throughout the entire school year. Teacher teams meet two to  three times a week to discuss and make grade decisions. On Mondays and Tuesdays during professional development  time, teacher teams meet to make instructional decisions based on the analysis of student results. This inquiry  process includes teachers developing common assessments that could be used to improve instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46     used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS41X Gun Hill Road, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support  of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team,  Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  [P.S. 41, The Gun Hill Road School] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 41 has developed a shared understanding of effective instruction by using the Danielson Framework for teaching to guide  our practice.  In literacy and math we are implementing new standards based curriculum using a constructivist approach to  student learning with an instructional focus grounded in timely actionable feedback.  In addition, we rely on ongoing  assessments such as Fountas and Pinnel running records in reading, benchmark assessments in GoMath, formative and  summative unit assessments as well as daily and weekly quick checks to identify gaps between the Common Core Learning  Standards and what our ELLs are capable of doing.  These assessments will also help measure the effectiveness of our  instruction and allow for teachers of ELLS to make necessary adjustments to their practice and to give actionable feedback,  crucial to student success.  Teachers will differentiate lessons based on data to ensure that all ELLS are challenged to learn and  develop a deep understanding of concepts and ideas presented in the classroom.     Classroom teachers and ELL teachers are given more opportunities to collaborate with common planning periods and  scheduled weekly Data Inquiry Team meetings.  PS 41 has taken a systematic and precise approach to inquiry and data-driven   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      instruction.  School wide norms are set in these meetings to remind teachers of ELLs of the inquiry process, keeping our work  aligned to the Common Core and increasing the rigor of everyday instruction of ELLS.            Data from Fountas and Pinnel running records indicates the need for support in reading instruction.  As a result ESL teachers  have been trained and utitlize the Leveled Literacy Intervention program.  This program provides daily instruction in decoding,  writing, comprehension, vocabulary, and sight words through a level library and other resources.  The program provides daily  homework that supports daily lessons.  Directions for homework are translated into Spanish and other languages as  needed.  The Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) is a small-group, supplementary literacy intervention  designed to help teachers provide powerful, daily, small-group instruction for the struggling students.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our Inquiry Team  is needs based and ongoing throughout the year.  There is a facilitator on each grade who meets the  teachers to collect and review data from the assessments to see the areas of strengths/weaknesses.  Lessons are planned and  instruction is differentiated to meet those needs.  This team is made up of Administration, Facilitators, Coaches and Classroom  Teachers.  This data drives instructional planning, addresses specific subgroups where assessments show areas of  weakness.  Our goal is to improve scores that are low as well as meet grade level requirements.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  .  We evaluate the success of our ELL program through data meetings where we discuss our ELL childrens Annual Yearly  Progressions.  These progressions are based on :  Test scores such as the NYSESLAT, NYS Math and ELA.  As well as teacher  observations, informal and formal assessments, reading , math and science unit tests.  Fountas and Pinnel running records,  and inquiry study.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    PS 41 is committed to support and address all students in need.  Once we have reviewed summative data we create a plan of  action.  Some ELLS are invited to Title 3 programs which will support them in areas of concern.  Some ELLs will receive  additional AIS services such as Level Literacy Intervention services.  The ENL teachers along with content area teachers and  school administrators support one another in developing a plan of action for all students based on data.  Children can receive  small group targeted instruction within the classroom via the ENL teacher and or the content area teacher.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   To provide ELLS with rigorous, culturally responsive instruction, PS 41 has a strong response to intervention model in  place.  Progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, and/or services; as  well as whether to consider referral to special education services.  We take into account ELLs language development and  background when monitoring progress.  During the weekly Data Inquiry Meetings, ELL student progress is compared with levels demonstrated by peers with  comparable, cultural and linguistic   background who have received the same or comparable interventions. Teachers and  school leaders use data to determine when it is necessary to adjust instruction for all ELLS.     Additionally, PS 41 has developed a shared understanding of effective instruction by using the Danielson Framework for  teaching to guide our practice.  In literacy and math we are implementing new standards based curriculum using a  constructivist approach to student learning with an instructional focus grounded in timely actionable feedback.  In addition, we  rely on ongoing assessments such unit tests for Ready Gen, benchmark assessments in GoMath, formative and summative unit  assessments as well as daily and weekly quick checks to identify gaps between the Common Core Learning Standards and what  our ELLs are capable of doing.  These assessments will also help measure the effectiveness of our instruction and allow for  teachers of ELLS to make necessary adjustments to their practice and to give actionable feedback, crucial to student  success.  Teachers will differentiate lessons based on data to ensure that every ELLS are challenged to learn and develop a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         deep understanding of concepts and ideas presented in the classroom.     Classroom teachers and ELL teachers are given more opportunities to collaborate with common planning periods and  scheduled weekly Data Inquiry Team meetings.  PS 41 has taken a systematic and precise approach to inquiry and data-driven  instruction.  School wide norms are set in these meetings to remind teacher of ELLs of the inquiry process, keeping our work  aligned to the Common Core and challenging the rigor of everyday instruction of ELLS.       Those children who are displaying difficulty with specific content or skills and are not yet meeting standards are placed in Tier  II instruction. Lessons/Activities are planned, tiered and differentiated to meet specific skills to reinforce the standard based  curriculum. Extra attention is given to these children in smaller group settings working on specific needs based instruction in  conjunction with core instruction. This remediation is done usually within a 6 to 8 week period and progress is constantly  monitored through observational notes of the classroom and ESL teachers, informal and formal assessments and diagnostics. If  after this time expected gains are still not meet the ELL child is then placed in Tier III where intense and individualized  instruction is planned for the specific needs of the child in small group and 1:1 (pull out) or within the classroom(push  in).These children are closely monitored and assessed. If a student is still displaying difficulties and challenges over a  substantial amount of time the School Based Support Team will then start the process to conduct a comprehensive and  multidisciplinary evaluation to help determine the possibility of special education services.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   As per our RLAT report PS 41 currently has a total of  98ELLS    This number represents approximately 11.62% of our school  population.  In grades K-5 we have 32.7% of our ELLS scoring at the Entering Level of language proficiency, 16.4% scoring at the  Emerging level, 20% scoring at the Transitioning level, and 31% % scoring at the expanding level on either the NISTELL or  NYSESlAT exams.  .  As evidenced by the data ELLs have been making continuous positive gains in the NYSESLAT exam.  However, several of our students are getting stuck on the expanding level of language acquisition from year to year.  This data  indicates that we need to support Expanding ELLS in reaching the commanding level.  Therefore, for the upcoming school year,  targeted Title 3 instruction will be provided to these ELLs.  Data also indicates that writing needs to be an area of focus for  transitioning and expanding students.  Our transitioning and expanding ELLS tend to score higher in both listening and  speaking.             7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teachers and content area teachers meet on a weekly basis to discuss progress and next steps.  Together we analyze  data to ensure that programs are created for Ells who need support in specific areas.  Title 3 monies may be used to support  such needs, AIS services may be recommended or small group Tier 2 targeted instruction.     This data drives our units/lessons in our curriculum map planning.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.        :PS 41 is a K-5 school with an enrollment of 964 students.  We currently have 110 English Language Learners (ELLs) in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         grade K - 5 that represents 11.62%  of our total population.  The ELLs are serviced using a combination of freestanding  and intergrated ESL model.  While the majority of ELLs are Spanish speakers, we also have speakers of of  Arabic, Vietnemese, French, Fulani, Hausa and Albanian.   In order to meet their education needs, we provide  additional enrichment programs beyond the school day.  Mainstream ESL student services are provided through a  combination of push-in and pull-out model.  Students are grouped according to needs and proficiency  levels.  All  ESL  teachers are dually certified in Common Branches and TESOL.               Our goal is to ensure that all programs offered to our English Language Learners will foster academic achievement in  all content areas and that the students reach proficiency in English by the end of their third year in the NYC school  system.  Our program also aims to attain the following high-priority goals:  *to increase reading achievement of all ELL students throughout grades K-5.  *To support ELLS with our newly aligned Common Core State Standards  based curriculum:  Ready Gen and Go Math      Our School has implemented a Collaborative Team Teaching (CTT) approach to provide services for the ELL  populations.  The ESL teachers work with the classroom teacher on a daily basis in order to ensure progress for each  English Language Learner.  Two New York State Certified English as a Second Language Teachers push in to ELL  classrooms or pull out small groups for ELL instruction.  One ESL teacher provides services to grades K-2, and the  other ESL teacher provides services for Grades 3-4 and entering and emerging level for Grade 5 students.  One dually  certified 5th grade teacher services all ELLS on grade 5 with collaboration of the ENL pull out person.    Ell students in  Grades K-5 who are at  the entering and emerging levels of English language proficiency receive 360 minutes  of ESL instruction per week, one unit of ENL and 1 unit of ENL/ELA)  as per CR Part 154.  ELL students at  the transitioning and expanding level of proficiency receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction per week as per CR Part  154.    All ELLS are programmed in STARS according to CR Part 154 Regulations.  Teachers align their schedules in order to  ensure that all mandated minutes are followed and programmed in STARS.  STARS is updated on a regular basis for  new entrants and discharged students.  The EDUR monthly report provides support for ELL/STARS coordinators to  ensure programming is correct.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The ELL push in /pull out services will be provided in accordance with the mandated ESL allotted time based on student  proficiency level.  These push in / pull out services are provided by 2  ESL teachers who are dually certified in Common  Branches and ESL. Additionally one dually certified ENL teacher provides mandated minutes to all grade 5 ELLs in a self  contained ENL classroom.  One ENL teacher will provide support for all entering and emerging ELLs on grade 5 as well.    The students who are Entering and Emerging levels will receive 360 minutes of instruction.  Small group instruction will also be  provided by ESL teacher based on needs and data.  The children who have acquired greater academic language proficiency and  perform at Transitioning and Expanding level of English proficiency will receive 180 minutes of instruction weekly in both ESL  and ELA.  This instruction takes place daily within small group pull-out instruction by dually certified ESL teachers.  The certified  and licensed ESL teacher pushes in or pull out for specific amount of time in accordance with CR part 154  regulations.  Newcomers with very limited English will be pulled out a period each day to work on small group instruction in  English Language and strengthen their vocabulary and oral language development.  The ESL teachers work collaboratively to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      both address the needs and promote the strengths of the children.  We will also continue to support English language  acquisition.  We will also continue to support English language acquisition through the implementation and support of the  Leveled Literacy intervention program focusing on strengthening reading and writing skills.:     All mandated minutes for each child are programmed into STARS.  In order to ensure accuracy, District 11 provides us with a  monthly Ell Data Update Report which provides us with detailed information in regards to our programming, compliance and  funding,       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In order to make Content Area comprehensible to ELLs, our teachers utilize the Danielson framework for teaching to guide  instruction.  Modifications for ELLs include:  building background knowledge where concepts explicitly linked to students'  background experiences; previous learning is connected to new learning; key vocabulary is emphasized and repeated in varied  ways.  etc     PS 41 has placed emphasis on science by forming a team of teachers dedicated to developing and teaching the science  curriculum throughout the school.  Science instruction in K-2 involves the Foss Hands-On Inquiry program.  The NYS Common  Core  Science Standards are promoted within read alouds, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading and  writing.  The use of the Scientific Method is utilized for recording observations, data, reactions and responses in science  journals.  Students in Grades 3-5 are using the Harcourt Science Program.  ELL students particularly benefit from these  programs because they are hands-on, manipulative based programs.      The "GO MATH" Mathematics program is the curriculum used in grades K-5.  Go MATH is a comprehensive, balanced  curriculum that is aligned with the NYS Common Core Standards.  The program engages and motivates students through the  use of manipulatives and games.  Teachers differentiate instruction based on student data, focusing on their individual  needs.  Additionally, the GO MATH program provides specific strategies and activities to meet the needs of ELL students and  ensure optimal success for them.     Social Studies instruction in Grades K-2 use Scott Foresman textbooks and hands-on materials, as well the Rosen and Dominie  Press Social Studies Libraries.  These differentiated, leveled content area materials are used for guided and independent  reading.  Textbooks are used as read-alouds and shared reading.  ELL students specially benefit from this mode of  instruction.  In addition, our students have access to World Book online for support in research based projects.  Spanish  translations are offered for this program.       I  :        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLS who meet the criteria are first tested using the NYSITELL .  Those children who are Spanish speaking and fall below the  cut scores are then tested in Spanish using the LAB-R test.  The LAB-R will be used to determine Spanish language  profiency.  State tests for MATH, and Science are ordered in the child's native and utilized when needed for state testing in  order to provide an optimal testing situation for ELLS.  ELLS with lower incidence languages who are in need of an oral  translation will receive translation from an outside vendor for MATH exams. ELLS who are native speakers can be given  translated versions of all Go Math assessments for support in their native language.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         A.  SIFE Students:  We currently do not have any SIFE students at our school however the following plan is in place if needed:  We will examine attendance records to see if a child started a NYC public school, returned to their native country and returned  back into NYC schools system.  This may possibly indicate an interruption in their formal education.  PS 41 will make an initial  SIFE determination within 30 days of a child's enrollment by ensuring the following:  1.  Administer the oral interview questionnaire.  For the children who have a home language of ARABIC, Haitian Creole,  Chinese, or Spanish they will be administered the LENS evaluation.  2.  Student's needs will be prioritized.  The students will be in a mainstream class served by the ESL teacher on a push- in/pullout basis.  They will receive additional interventions from reading/math AIS support staff.  Guidance will also be made  available if needed.     B.  Newcomers:   ELL students new to the country are not usually grouped by grade but by level of language acquisition and  data based needs.   ELL teachers pull-out newcomers across grade levels at least 4 out of the 8 mandated periods .  During this  time the focus is on strengthening basic interpersonal communication skills and intensive vocabulary development.  Activities  such as role playing, dramatic play, cooking, and games are being used to internalize the English language.  This a pull-out  component that allows newcomers to experience their second language in a non threatening, exciting environment.  The  additional mandated time is spent on fostering reading and writing development within the classroom using ESL  methodologies.   Several newcomers will also participate in a computer based ESL program:  Imagine Learning.  Additionally,  we will continue with our Title III NEWCOMER Club which focuses on vocabulary development through music, role playing and  music.  Literacy skills will be reinforced as per data provided by both ELL and Classroom teachers.     C.  ELL students who are still developing and strengthening their English skills will be closely progress monitored through both  formal and informal assessments such as i-ready computer diagnostic, Leveled Literacy Intervention (Fountas and Pinell)  running records,  unit assessments , etc.  ELL teachers and classroom teacher will closely work together to develop lessons that  are scaffolded and differentiated to support "developing"  ELLS.               ESL teachers collaborate with class  teacher to identify gaps in ELL student learning.  These students receive whole class  instruction, small group instruction with classroom instruction and small groups instruction with ELL teacher.  Intensive  academic vocabulary instruction is highlighted during small group ELL instruction.  The ELL teacher scaffolds instruction based  on student needs and English language proficiency levels.  When the need arises for additional support AIS staff will also  provide a level of support.     D.  Long Term ELLs:  We currently have no long term ELLs at PS 41.  However, if in the case that we receive a long term ELL the  following will be in place:     *The student will be continually progress monitored so that instruction specifically devoted to the strengths and weaknesses  of this child   *ELL teacher, AIS  staff,  special ed support services and classroom teacher will work collaboratively to review and plan  effective reading and mathematics lessons         E. Former ELLS:  ELL teachers will continue to collaborate with classroom teachers in order to provide best instruction for these students.  We  will continue to use data to drive instruction and support formers ELLS academically and socially.:       ELL teachers and administration continuously refer to the EPRG (Ell Policy Reference Guide) to ensure that each sub groups of  ELLS are receiving their mandated ENL services and accommodations.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      All teachers at PS 41 use the Danielson Framework to plan and guide instruction.  Danielson allows for modifications that will  support English Language Learners.  Such modifications may include:  re-teaching; scaffolding questions as a support, preview  of academic vocabulary, use of technology, etc.  Ells are provided with grade level materials by using the newly designed Common Core aligned reading (Ready Gen) and math  (Go Math) curricula.  These curricula provide support for Ells through modifications made during lessons to provide scaffolding  lessons & questions in order to allow for comprehensible input.            7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Special Education teachers, including SETSS teachers, and ELL teachers collaborate on a regular basis to ensure that the ELLs- SWDs , academic needs are being addressed.  IEP goals are reviewed and ensured that these goals are being addressed in daily  instruction by all service providers.  ESL teachers and SETSS teachers often push in and work collaboratively in order to provide  academic success for ELLs with disabilities.  Using the Danielson Framework for teaching as a model, lessons are scaffolded to  provide different points of entry for students.  Modifications and adjustments are made as needed based on data.  Thus,  intensive targeted intervention to support ELLs with IEPs such as Leveled Literacy Intervention, Wilson or Fundations Reading  programs.                  8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  c.     ELLS will be chosen based on a collaborative discussion with ELL teachers and classroom teachers.  Data from NYSESLAT will be  considered along with formal and informal classroom assessments, running records, unit tests, etc     Imagine Learning is an individualized computer based program.  It is designed to strengthen and support all modalities of  literacy and language acquisition.  The Imagine Learning software uses engaging multi media to teach students to speak and  read English.  It provides instruction and practice in phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension.  Imagine  Learning provides direction in native language for speakers of Spanish, Arabic, Hatiian Creole, etc.     Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI):  Supports struggling ELLs in intensive reading and writing support.  The LLI lessons,  including reading, writing, phonics, word study and the extensive use of oral language and vocabulary  instruction.  Modifications  are built in to the program to support our English Language Learners.     Raz Kids: In order to support reading, PS 41 has purchased a RAZ Kids license for all ELLS.   This program is an online guided  reading program with interactive e-books, downloadable books and reading quizzes to assess comprehension. Additionally, we  have the MYON reading on line program where students can access books in both English and Spanish books.  Teachers have access to A to Z reading to support guided/independent reading instruction.  Spanish books may be downloaded  for newcomers if needed.     The classroom teachers of ELLS follow the math pacing calendar aligned to the common core to assess students and uses item  analysis to determine student needs.  All students will be identified for intervention based on Go MATH assessments in grades  K-3.  Grades 4-5 we will use a combination of Go Math assessments and prior years State Math Assessment. Go Math contains  an ESL activity guide which will be used for intervention support.  The guide is designed to supplement English Language  acquisition .  Additionally, Go MAth incorporates  differentiated instruction utilizing ESL strategies for each and every  lesson.  These modifications will be used for Tier 2 small group instruction within in the classroom.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                   9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are looking into an effective program that will support our beginners.  Beginners who recently arrived to the US.  We have  been researching materials that would support newly arrived ELLS giving them the basics they need to further develop their  language.  We have recently set up a web cast to preview the Pearson Language Central program.     Imagine Learning will be purchased for 28 ELL students based ELL status.  Entering and emerging ELLS will participate in  Imagine Learning which is a computerized individualized English language program.  Support in native language is provided for  several languages.              10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We do not have any programs that have been discontinued for ELLs. We currently do not have enough parents who choose  bilingual as their first choice.  Therefore we have not opened a bilingual class. However, we have made adjustments to  curriculum material and programs that will benefit ELLS.  We currently incorporate Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) by  Fountas and Pinnel as one of our materials used for ELLS.  We have tweaked the program and worked collaboratively with the  LLI team to better serve the needs of ELLS using the program.  One example of a modification we have made is that some  lessons are taught over a two day period providing more time for differentiation and scaffolding for the more complex LLI  lessons/texts.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLS are heterogeneously mainstreamed into the classroom where they are eligible and participate in school programs  available.   ESL students are invited to all after school programs and enrichment after school programs.  Additionally, Title III  funds are used to have after school programs solely for ELLS based on needs and data analysis.  One ESL teacher will have a  new comers club focusing on oral language development through song, TPR, poetry , technology, etc.  The ESL teachers for  Grades 3-5 will have an after school reading club which will focus on comprehension, phonics and writing.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Ready Gen, Go MAth, laptops, i-pads, smart boards, computer based programs:  ,. Raz kids, Imagine Learning, Starfall; Foss  Hands on Science; Harcourt Science, Math journals; Leveled Literacy Libraries, Leveled Literacy Intervention programs,  fundations, Wilson, math manipulative, World Book online subscription, etc        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support will be delivered in our ENL program through the use of dictionaries, pictures that feature translation  in native languages.  Additionally the following programs provide support in native language.  Ell teachers are able to support English Language learners in their native language by becoming familiar with the make up of  our students' first language.  Knowledge of how their native language words provide support in developing their 2nd  language:  English.       Go Math:  allows teachers to print each lessons, homework and tests for native speakers of Spanish  Think Central: an online program to support Math instruction provides Native language support in Spanish for parents for  lessons and support lessons assigned by teachers.   We also use an online individualized math website:  Mathletics:  This  program is aligned with CCSS and provides both support for struggling students as well as enrichment for other students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         Imagine Learning, an individualized computer program, provides support in native language.  The program provides directions  to students for their native language so that they comprehend the tasks they are working on.     Individual guided reading books , through A to Z reading can be printed and downloaded for speakers of Spanish for  independent reading time.  These will be used for newcomers reading in their native language.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELL teacher services are aligned with grade curricula.  Continual look at data allows for teachers of ELLS to close the gaps  between Common Core Learning Standards and what our students are capable of.  Resources are grade appropriate and  provide the level of support needed to ensure success for all ELLS.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    not applicable     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the kindergarten level, PS 41 offers a parent orientation for all incoming K students, including ELLs.  Kindergarten teachers  and parent coordinator preview procedures for a smooth transition in the our school.  Curriculum and expectations are  reviewed at the orientation.  Parents are encouraged to ask questions, discuss concerns and celebrate their excitement about  becoming part of our school community.  Spanish translation is available.      We also plan to continue our ESL Newcomer Club using Title III funds.  ELL teachers will continue to team teach with general  education teaches to support newly arrived ELLS both academically and socially.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered at PS 41        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?     not applicable:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  As mandated each school must provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses  the needs of English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours  for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co- teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English  as a new language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co- teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.      Individual Teachers will also be sent to workshops in areas that will benefit all children inclusive of our immigrant and ELLs.  These teachers will then turnkey this information to other teachers on the grade or across the grades to provide the building  blocks necessary to support and strengthen the needs of our learners. Monthly meetings will also be in place to discuss ELL  related topics (data, progress, PDs)    ENL teachers and classroom teachers of ELLs will meet regularly on Tuesday afternoons to discuss student progress, how to  support ELLs in Common Core Learning Standards , Language Learning Progressions and to review student data.  These  meetings will serve as tool for future instruction and professional development needs.    ENL teachers will attend monthly ENL liasion meeting and turnkey all information for all teachers of ELLS.    The following topics  in addition to others as needs arise will be covered:     *Supporting Newcomers In the Mainstream Classroom                                                                Fall 2017  *Understanding Stages of Language Acquisition to Support ELLS in the mainstream  classroom                                                                Fall 2017  *Scaffolding instruction for ELLS within Content Areas                                                         Ongoing  Differentiating for ELLS within Classroom                                              Ongoing  * Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT                                                      Spring 2019  * Using Technology to Support ELLs /Imagine Learning                           Ongoing      L.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    .      Teachers and other staff responsible for the delivery of instruction and services to limited English proficient students are  involved in on-going professional development.  ESL teachers and classroom teachers articulate with the DATA CORE teams,  AIS and SETSS teachers, to discuss progress of ESL students.  After analyzing data, professional development activities are  planned based on the needs of students and teachers.    Additionally, teachers attend professional development for our new  Common core Aligned Math and ELA curricula:  Go Math and Ready Gen.      Based on the results of the needs assessment survey given to classroom teachers who service ELLs, and/or teachers who need  the mandated 15% of  hours in  ELL professional development, the following on-site staff development topics will be  addressed:  Professional development will take place during common planning times, Monday and or Tuesday during contractual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         professional development time.

Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At PS 41 we have an open door policy where parents are encouraged to call or meet whenever there is a concern or issue. In  addition to our mandated parent orientation meetings,  PS 41 will have additional  one to one scheduled meetings with  parents of ELLS.  Teachers of ELLS and ESL teachers will utilize the contractual parent contact time on Tuesday afternoons to  meet with individual parents of ELLS based on needs.  If these times are not conducive to parent schedules, other times and  days will be made available.  These meetings will keep parents of ELLS abreast on their child's level and progression.  These  meetings will encourage a "Team Effort" to enable further success in content areas.  If needed we will have Spanish speaking  translators available and will provide oral translation from the Translation Unit if necessary .      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.            ELL parents are invited and actively participate in all areas of parental involvement at PS41.

The Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), required of  parents/ guardians at registration, identifies those students that qualify to be tested using the New York  Identification Test for English Language Learners (NISTELL) within ten days of registration.  The  administration of the HLIS and the initial screening is conducted by the ESL teachers:  Mrs. Calabrese and  Ms. Lantigua.  One of the ESL teachers interviews and assists the parent while completing the  HLIS.  Teachers who speak various lower-incidence languages provide translation services when needed.  If a  language other than English is indicated then an informal oral interview in English and in the native language  is done with the student to determine English proficiency.  After the informal interview, if the student is  dominant in another language, the NYSITELL is administered by the ESL teachers mentioned above to  determine ELL eligibility.  If eligibility is determined necessary parents will be notified within 5 days as per  new CR-PART 154 mandates.  In addition, non entitlement letters , as per results of NYSITELL, will be sent  home withing 5 days of testing.       Our Spanish speakers are tested with the Spanish LAB if they qualify for services based on the NYSITELL  results.  The results determine our ELL population, which can be further identified as ELLs who are Native  Spanish Speakers or ELLs with other native languages.  Subsequently, our will hold a few parent  orientations.   In the Parent Orientations, they view the DOE ELL Parent Orientation on line video in their  home language which informs them of the NYC DOE ELL programs.  Brochures (translated if needed) are also  distributed , further explaining the programs.  The Parent Survey and Program Selection forms are then  given to the parents to complete.  One of the ESL teachers reads the questions on the survey to the  parents.  Parents complete the survey and program selection forms, Appendices C and D, also available in  their home languages.  As a result of the program selection process, we place students according to the  parent selection.  Historically, about 98% choose Freestanding English As a Second Language  Program.  However, if we do have parents who select a Transitional Bilingual (TBE) or Dual Language we  inform them of their options.  We explain that the numbers of students needed across two grades to open a  TBE.  We offer to place their names on a waiting list with the possibility of opening a class if the required  number is attained.  They are further informed of their transfer options to a school within the district that  offers their program of choice.   Entitlement letters are sent to the parent within 5 days of testing.  The  letter informs them of ELL eligibility and invites them to the parent orientation meeting.  Letters are  distributed one week prior to the meeting and reminder letters are distributed two days before the  meeting. as well as phone calls to perform.    Many parents attend the orientation meeting and select a program at that time.  Those who do not attend  receive follow up written notices and phone calls.  As per the new CR_PART 154 regulations, if a parent does  not return or come in to sign Parent Choice forms within 5 school days the following will occur:   The student will be placed in a bilingual class (which currently does not exist at PS 41).  Therefore, these  students will be placed in an ENL class (English New Language).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75        If a parent's choice is not currently available at our school we will inform the parent that the selection is not  available and provide 3 different options.    Option 1:  Keep the student enrolled in our school in the available program.  Option 2:   Transfer their child to a different school where their first choice is currently available.     Currently we  do not have the numbers of students to create a bilingual program due to parent  choice.  However, If the parent choice is not available  at the school, students be put on a waiting to  determine if we gain sufficient numbers to create these programs.     If a parent would like  a transfer, ESL teachers will immediately contact the Department of English Learners  and Student support and coordinate a transfer with office of student enrollment.      Additionally, in order to ensure 100% of parent choice forms are signed,  the ESL teachers attend several  evening school functions.  The majority of ELL parents attend our school wide functions thus, allowing us to  meet individually with parents to discuss their parent choice options.  Parents are also invited to meet one- on-one with an ESL staff member during preparation periods, before or after school.  In addition, parents of  ELLs who are entitled based on NYSESLAT results receive letters of their child’s continued entitlement to  mandated ESL services.  We obtain the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT Exam History Report (RLAT) and identify each  student’s proficiency level.  All ELLs are administered the NYSESLAT in the spring.  Each student’s continued  entitlement is determined by his or her performance on the NYSESLAT, administered annually in the spring.  The scores are reviewed to plan and differentiate our instruction program for our ELLs.  A copy of all these  parent letters are filed in a binder.    Immediately following the identification and entitlement of a new ESL students, the ESL teachers provide  several small group Parent Orientation sessions.  These small group sessions, allows for more discussion and  clarification of parental choices.  In the Parent Orientations, they view the DOE ELL Parent Orientation  online video in their home language and informs them of the NYC DOE ELL programs.  Brochures (translated  if needed) are also distributed further explaining the programs.  The Parent Survey and Program Selection  forms are then given to the parents to complete.  One of the ESL teachers reads the questions on the survey  to the parents.  Parents complete the survey and program selection forms, Appendices C and D, also  available in their home languages.  As a result of the program selection process, we place students according  to the parent selection.  Historically, 100% choose Freestanding English As a Second Language  Program.  However, if we do have parents who select a Transitional Bilingual (TBE) or Dual Language we  inform them of their options.  We explain that the numbers of students needed across two grades to open a  TBE.  We offer to place their names on a waiting list with the possibility of opening a class if the required  number is attained.  They are further informed of their transfer options to a school within the district that  offers their program of choice.   Entitlement letters are sent to the parent once ELL eligibility is  determined.  The letter informs them of ELL eligibility and invites them to the parent orientation  meeting.  Letters are distributed one week prior to the meeting and reminder letters are distributed two   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.   days before the meeting.  .      Many parents attend the orientation meeting and select a program at that time.  Those who do not attend  receive written notices and phone calls.  Additionally, in order to ensure 100% of parent choice forms are  signed,  the ESL teachers attend several evening school functions.  The majority of ELL parents attend our  school wide functions thus, allowing us to meet individually with parents to discuss their parent choice  options.  Parents are also invited to meet one-on-one with an ESL staff member during preparation periods,  before or after school.  In addition, parents of ELLs who are entitled based on NYSESLAT results receive  letters of their child’s continued entitlement to mandated ESL services.  We obtain the LAB-R, NYSESLAT  Exam History Report (RLAT) and identify each student’s proficiency level.   Each student’s continued  entitlement is determined by his or her performance on the NYSESLAT, administered annually in the spring.  The scores are reviewed to plan and differentiate our instruction program for our ELLs.  A copy of all these  parent letters are filed in a binder.        , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77             11.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      PS 41 has undertaken several steps in order to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely  information in a language they can understand. First, the Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) were  reviewed to identify which languages were read and written at home. This was done by the ESL teachers in  conjunction with the school’s bilingual (Spanish/English) Parent Coordinator. Next, an informal oral language  survey was conducted by the ESL teachers with the students to clarify the language needs in the home. Finally, the  classroom teachers discussed with the ESL teachers and the Parent Coordinator the language needs of the parents  with whom they need to communicate. The language in which translation is needed is Spanish. Additionally, it  was determined that for IEP meetings, oral interpretation services may need to be provided in home language.   When parents first arrive at PS 41's main entrance, they are greeted by the multilingual Welcome Poster, located  directly behind the security sign in desk. In addition, the language identification guide is on the main office   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      counter which makes parents aware of the availability of language services offered. The parent coordinator along  with the language coordinator are aware of the direct number for the translation services if needed at any time.  This ensures us to determine the needs of our parents within 30 days of a students enrollment allowing us to  arrange and manage any translation and interpretation needs they may need throughout the school year.  Additionally, many of our registration documents are readily available in alternate languages provided by DOE  translation unit including but not limited to: emergency cards, ethnicity identification, bill of rights, etc.    In order to gather data regarding home language and written/oral language preference, we use several sources of  data. Our primary source is the HOME LANGUAGE survey. Part II of the HLIS allows us to know the language or  preference in the home. We also gather reports from ATS (HOME language Aggregate) to cross reference parental  language choice. Our registration packet and informal meetings during registration enables us to become familiar  with parental choice in written and oral language for conferences, meetings, workshops etc.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
