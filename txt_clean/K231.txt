This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The school’s mission statement conveys our community’s understanding that we are all life-long learners, and seeks  to honor the contributions of all members. The mission statement highlights the role of teacher collaboration, which  is demonstrated in our numerous teacher teams that meet weekly to share samples of student work, analyze data  and plan corrective with the goal of increasing student achievement. Our teacher teams also foster teachers’  professional reflection, the spirit of collegiality and collaboration within our school. We at P231K work to nurture an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      inclusive community of diverse learners. We collaborate in order to plan and implement purposeful instruction that  honors each member’s abilities and contributions. Our mission states:      P231K is a collaborative, safe community that celebrates and individualizes teaching and learning. Parents play an  essential role and are a valuable asset within our school community. Our collective goal is for every student to achieve  the highest level of independence possible by ensuring functional communication, coping strategies, as well as social  skills. We aim for all students contribute positively to the larger society, which may include working and/or attending  college. In order to reach our goal we provide student-centered instruction and support, as well as training for  parents and staff. We vigorously work to provide multiple opportunities across a variety of setting to support learning,  and promote happiness and well-being.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P231K is a District 75 program that services approximately 348 students in grades kindergarten through grade eight  across six sites located in Borough Park, Bay Ridge, Bedford Stuyvesant and Gravesend, Brooklyn. The range of  disabilities includes the following: students with autism, students who are intellectually disabled, emotional  disturbance as well as speech and language impairments.      Our current population also includes approximately 30% of English Language Learners (ENL) who are afforded greater  supports to access academic content through ENL teachers as well as ENL methodologies. Our student population  participates in both alternate and standardized assessments. In addition, we have a small cohort of verbal behavior  classrooms, which address students who are cognitively young and require, intensive pre-academic teaching. There is  also a small percentage of students with the emotional disturbance classification who we support with intensive  behavior interventions. Additionally, there are three inclusion classes across three sites; these classes offer our  students greater access to age-appropriate Common Core aligned curricula and opportunities to socialize with their  typically developing peers.      Our school’s Theory of Action (TOA) is grounded in the work of teachers and teacher teams in collecting and analyzing  student achievement data. It traces a series of steps from assessment through analysis with the ultimate goal of  improving student outcomes. The TOA begins with teachers using assessment tools to collect data for all students and  ends with students being prepared to find their niche in an ever-changing workforce. This reflects our organization’s  focus on students achieving their highest level of independence in an effort to make all students college and career  ready.      Theory of Action:   • If teachers use assessment tools to collect data for all students, then teachers will be able to articulate what  students know and are able to do.   • If teachers are able to articulate what students know and are able to do, then teachers can identify new content and  skills they need to teach.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      • If teachers can identify new content and skills they need to teach, then students will learn the new content and skills  that will move their learning forward.   • If students learn new content and skills that moves their learning forward, then students will be prepared to find  their niche in an ever-changing workforce.         The home-school partnership is an essential part of our school community; parents collaborate with P231K to help us  incorporate effective strategies into our classrooms.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Within the continuum of students with special needs, there are sub-sets of students who require greater supports.  Some of these groups include the following:      Verbal Behavior: Our Verbal Behavior program serves our earliest learners: the students whose profound  developmental and speech delays prevent them from being successful in CCLS-aligned academic instruction. When  placed in purely academic environments, these students struggle to learn and retain skills, because they cannot  understand what is said to them, or express their own understandings. In the past, we struggled to meet these  students' needs and provide them with essential skills for independence and self-advocacy.      To address the needs of these students, we developed our Verbal Behavior program. VB classes focus on teaching  functional communication so that students develop the ability to engage in conversation with adults and peers. Each  student is provided with highly individualized, ABA-based instruction that helps them quickly develop the  communication skills they need to be successful in a traditional academic environment.      Our Verbal Behavior program is an intervention, designed to move students into less restrictive environments as  quickly as possible. When students are able to communicate at the level of a typical 5-year-old, they move into an  academic alternate assessment classroom, where they are now prepared to keep up with a full-day academic  curriculum. We have found that our Verbal Behavior "graduates" are very successful in academic instruction, and  many of them eventually move into an inclusion setting. The Verbal Behavior program provides a necessary  foundation so these students can meet their full potential.      Inclusion: Students in self-contained classrooms are routinely assessed to determine whether they are able to thrive  in a general-education setting. The unit coordinator, cluster teachers, related service providers and an inclusion  teacher are involved in the decision to begin the process of transitioning students to inclusion. Students begin the  transition by being mainstreamed in a general education classroom for several periods each week in order to ensure  that he/she is appropriately placed. The team checks in with the general education teacher to weigh in on placement.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Students who are part of our inclusion program receive a wide range of services depending on their needs. Students’  academic functioning ranges from significantly delayed to significantly advanced, so supports are determined on an  individual basis. The curriculum is adapted for our alternate assessment students who are part of a general education  class and for standard assessment students who are significantly below grade level in reading and math. Inclusion  teachers work closely with their general education colleagues and programmatic paraprofessionals to meet and  differentiate for students’ academic and behavioral needs. Our inclusion classes serve students who are classified  with emotional disturbance, autism, and speech-language impairment. The inclusion teacher offers students  opportunities to work on social skills, provides remediation with individual and small-group instruction, and provides  a space to study, complete homework, and use a computer and printer. These systems are in place to provide our  students with the supports necessary to maximize their levels of achievement.      ELLs: The percentage of students identified as English Language Learners in the P231K community continues to grow.  We analyzed ABLLS-r/S.A.N.D.I. student performance data in multiple key indicators using the baseline and mid-year  scores for ELLs.      Based on the above-referenced student performance data, P231K’s approach to increasing instructional effectiveness  is to promoting oral language. Looking ahead to the school year 2018-2019, our intention is to support greater  achievement with an explicit focus on oral language for students identified as ELLs. This work is informed and guided  by, “Supporting ELL’s Achievement: Oral Language Unpacked” by Nonie K. Lesalix and Julie Russ Harris in partnership  with the NYC DOE Division of English Language Learners and Student Support. Building on the the Title III program, in  2018-2019 we will be offering an afterschool program which focuses on oral communication skills within the context  of fairy tales to further build students' literacy skills. The program is intended to support parent outreach and include  specific dates when parents are invited to participate in the lessons and engage in literacy practices with their  children. The program will run during the fall and winter months.       Students with Emotional Disturbances: Students classified as emotionally disturbed require tiered levels of academic  and behavior management support and intervention. Social/emotional supports range from school-wide expectations  (daily point sheets) and incentives (trips/weekly clubs) to more targeted, individual interventions (Functional Behavior  Assessments/Behavior Intervention Plans). Standard Assessment students with emotional disabilities follow the  general education curriculum with adaptations to ensure maximal student learning. Direct Instruction is utilized to  target specific skill deficits. Expectations for academic activities and routines are clearly communicated, consistent,  and achievable. Classroom environments are set up to support students' individual learning needs, with thoughtful  consideration of various factors that affect student performance.      Social/emotional supports include evidence-based interventions to help students develop skills in the areas of anger  management, self-regulation, and social problem-solving. Students receive school-based counseling services to  develop positive social/emotional skills, and teachers and counselors work together to generalize positive social skills  within classrooms. Crisis de-escalation teams are identified to respond to high-level incidents of problem behavior,  and staff uses Therapeutic Crisis Intervention strategies to create constructive learning opportunities for adaptive  behavior change following crises. In addition, teachers, counselors and parent coordinators work to provide outreach  to parents to collaborate and implement resources to meet the comprehensive needs of children and families.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      P231K has made substantial gains in many areas of our Chancellor’s Framework for Great Schools. These areas include  rigorous instruction, collaboration, strong family-community ties, supportive environment, effective school  leadership, and trust.      With respect to rigorous instruction, teachers are afforded a vast array of feedback and support to improve their  pedagogical practices. Administrators conduct monthly staff meetings and provide detailed observation feedback to  teachers in order to cultivate and improve teachers’ instructional practices. In addition, administrators observe  teachers’ practice and monitor attendance at professional development in order assist teachers in incorporating new  methodologies into their classroom practice and teacher team meetings. The administrative team also support  teachers by providing constructive, non-evaluative feedback in classroom instruction as well as inquiry-based and  other student-centered activities.      In the 2018-2019 school year, P231K will continue to employ strategic scheduling to facilitate teacher collaboration  and increase the time students engage with Common Core aligned content. Through strategic scheduling and  teachers’ selections of professional activities, we have increased the time teachers reflect on their practice, analyze  student work and make adjustments to their instruction.      With respect to effective leadership, the administrative cabinet continues to incorporate feedback from our Learning  Environment Survey, UFT consultation, Extended Cabinet (members include representatives from all sites). This  feedback is later incorporated into the CEP and other organizational goals. Successfully incorporating feedback into  our collective practices is one of many ways P231K strives to be both effective and responsive to all stakeholders of  the community. The administrative body of P231K employs best practices as well as appropriately support students  and staff. The Data Analysis Committee survey staff with regard to the implementation of the P231K's S.A.N.D.I. Units  of Study. Based on student performance data together with results of the teacher survey, the data team convened  and in consultation with the Administrative Cabinet determined the following:     The curriculum calendar for 2017-2018, having monthly units of study, did not provide sufficient time for   teachers to fully teach the content and allow students to explore the content deeply within each unit. As a  result, there was a strategic decision to modify the time-frame for the Units of Study from one month to six  weeks, taking into account vacations, days off and the intensity of topics that may have been cut too short  due to the original time allocation.      An area of strength of the Units of Study is the specificity of the learning targets based on S.A.N.D.I.  assessment data. It does how ever present a challenge for instructional teams to identify and modify  resources to support instruction. The Data Analysis Committee identified five curricula (Attainment ELA,  Treasures, EngageNY ELA and Math and Math in Focus) teachers could use to supplement the Units of Study.  To respond to this need the Data Analysis Committee undertook the task of identifying where resources such  as Equals, EngageNY and Math in Focus are aligned to the Units of Study so as to create a crosswalk. The  intention was to take away what was seen as a heavy lift on the part of classroom teams to locate aligned  resources. The Data Analysis Committee's express goal was to provide staff with a single document which  identifies where, within each resource, the instructional materials for each unit are located.      Teachers were surveyed to share how they would like to receive support in the implementation of the Units   of Study. Survey results focused on three support models. Both inter-visitations and professional  development were most highly prized by instructional teams (representing 94% of the responses) and "in- class coaching" was least desirable representing 4%. As a result of this feedback, the Administrative Cabinet  took the following steps. 1. Professional Development was tailored to address teacher concerns around the  P231K S.A.N.D.I. Units of Study. 2. Election Day Professional Development in November, 2018 will revisit the  Units of Study and continue to make adjustments as needed and requested by staff. 3. P231K administration   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      will work with teachers to provide opportunities for inter-visitations both within sites and cross -sites. During  the 2018 Chancellor's Day professional development teachers were encouraged to have ongoing  conversations with their site supervisors.   Effective Leadership remains an important component to the work of P231K. To improve the feedback loop and  communication between all of the internal stakeholders within and across the P231K community, during the 2018- 2019 school year, we will focus on a targeted, instructional visitation schedule, on-going formal and informal  community surveys the development of the design of an internal P231K website/platform to serve as a resource for  teachers. For the 2018-2019 school year, the administration made a strategic decision to maximize the work of the  Data/Instructional Cabinet. We recognized that the members of the committee had already taken on additional roles  and were in fact able to identify important next steps based on the analysis of student performance data. In 2018- 2019 the Data Analysis Committee will be identified as the P231K Data and Instructional Cabinet, which reflects both  their analysis of data and how P231K uses data to make strategic decisions around instruction.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75K231   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   01,02,03,04,05,06,0 7,08,09,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   352   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        In 2016-2017 we piloted a new the First Author Writing Curriculum with the intention of providing students who  participate in alternate assessment with, “An authentic ELA learning experience that mirrors more closely the writing  experiences of their general education peers in community schools.” To support that work, the school community  believes it is critical for all students to engage in writing on a daily basis and then to share their work with peers.  Developing writing skills is also a critical factor in self-advocacy, independence and transition which were central to  our instructional focus in the 2017-2018 school year. That year we expanded the pilot and nearly doubled the number  of teachers implementing First Author's Writing curriculum. A comparison of baseline and mid-line data from 2017- 2018 demonstrated several important changes as indicated in the First Author table below. Some significant data  points are as follows:              Students demonstrated a 6% increase in scribbling.  Students demonstrated a 13.7% decrease in drawing.   Students demonstrated a 6.3% increase in writing three or more related sentences.   Students demonstrated a 4.9% increase in writing partial sentences, or more than three words.   Students demonstrated a 4.1% increase in writing three or more related sentences.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  P231K extends an open invitation to parents to visit their children’s classroom at any point with an appointment. In  addition, Family Fun Fridays presents an ideal opportunity to our internal school community to share many of the  structures and routines with parents and guardians some of the curricula that help to facilitate the social and  academic success of our students while in school. Our teachers encourage all parents to continue many of these  practices at home.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In school year 2017-2018, the administrative cabinet reviewed and analyzed the VADIR scores by individual sites  based on the nature of the offense and also identified specific students by name to suport strategic decisions to  address by number of weighted incidents.    The administrative cabinet brought together the counseling department on May 2, 2018 to review the VADIR scores  using the Data-Driven Protocol which including making predictions, generating possible explanations, and identifying  next steps. In terms of making predictions ("What we think the data will show…") the following responses were  offered: (1) Different incidents are happening at different sites for example with more aggression at the main site but  non-compliance at the other sites, (2) There won’t be as many reports of aggression. (3) Our VB and early learners will  show up on the list, (4) Middle school will have more coming of age problems, (5) For some students it will be a  onetime incident, (6) More frequent incidents of biting for those students who cannot communicate.   In terms of reviewing the data the team identified the following patterns or trends: (1) There are 2 students at 264  with multiple physical injury offenses, (2) There are 2 students at 180 with multiple physical injury offenses, (3) Sexual  offenses occurring most often at the middle school site (238), (4) Larger sites (180 and 238) have more of the  incidents, (5) Assaults with physical injury occurred across all the sites, (6) 4 students at 30/264 were new to 231 this  year, and (7) 238 just switched from elementary to entirely a middle school setting.   The teams the generated a list of possible explanations (causation) considerations for the VADIR scores which  included the following: (1) For some students they are just new to the 231 environment, (2) For some students we  introduced a change of setting (to VB or from VB) where the level of effortful demand changes (change in demands,  frustration level), (3) Student moving from VB to non-VB setting may not be receiving the same level of reinforcement  as much as before, and (4) Students are getting older, are moving into puberty and are coming of age.   In terms of next steps, the team generated a list of possible actions for the balance of the school year and the 2018- 2019 school year including implementation of Behavior Support Plans (BSP) and FBA/BIPs with greater consistency  and fidelity, providing teachers and paras with more training and more supervision of progress monitoring. An  additional next step included the development of an excel document which includes the name of every student and  identifies their “go to” person, triggers, like and dislikes. When a weighted incident occurs, a Pupil Personnel Team  (PPT) must be conducted to discuss the problem behavior, interventions and next steps; a follow up meeting is also  scheduled.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

The Verbal Behavior (VB) program at P231K uses the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to teach students  pre-academic, academic, and activities of daily living skills. Targeting these skill deficits allows students to scaffold  toward accessing the Common Core Learning Standards. Instruction is built on students’ individual interests and  cultural backgrounds.   The facets of our program include one-to-one language instruction include (1) functional skills, (2) reading and (3)  math instruction, as well as (3) natural environment teaching. The specific teaching procedures rely heavily on the  implementation of positive reinforcement, pairing (building a rapport with the student), fading in the number of  demands, fading in the difficulty of demands, and using errorless teaching. These instructional practices are  differentiated for each student’s individual need. The earliest learners in our program learn to use a functional  method of communication to request their most important wants and needs; the most advanced students in the  Verbal Behavior program learn sophisticated language skills such as describing language, function, feature, and class  of things in their natural environment.   Students in P231K’s VB program are assessed using the ABLLS-r and the Essential for Living program. Students’ IEP  goals and learning targets are derived from the analysis of these assessments. The ABLLS-r measures a student’s skill  sets on 27 different domains such as labeling, receptive language, motor imitation, etc. These are the skills a neuro- typical five-year-old would have upon entering kindergarten. The Essential for Living assessment measures student’s  performance on functional skills such as maintaining appropriate behavior, activities of daily living, tolerating  situations, following directions related to health and safety, etc.   The Verbal Behavior program is driven by data at the student, classroom, and school level. In the classroom, data is  collected and analyzed daily for each student’s requesting program, instructional program, and behavior intervention  plan. During Common Planning and inquiry work, VB teachers look at their collective class data to design and test new  teaching strategies. As a school, we have established a “P231K ABLLS-r Database”, where we track each student’s  ABLLS-r scores three times per year. This ABLLS-r database allows us to measure growth over time and analyze  subgroups that may need additional supports.   As a multi-sited school, it is sometimes challenging to collaborate effectively with all VB teachers spread across six  sites. To help overcome these limitations and foster teacher collaboration, we used various supports and technologies  during the 2017-2018 school-year. Each VB teacher was given a laptop which was used to track data and engage in  collaborative inquiry across sites via Skype. The Data Analysis Team has created an Excel program that teachers can  use to enter student’s data, facilitating easier data analysis and the ability to share information across sites. The  program generates graphs to help teachers analyze trends in student performance. Throughout the year,  administrators, coach, and VB leaders collaborated to identify and support new opportunities in this area and will  continue to do so during the 2018-2019 school-year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26      Data showed that students in upper grade classes (grades 5-8) had plateaued on the ABLLS-r assessement. In  consultation with the D75 Autism Coach, 231K Verbal Behavior Coach and the Carbone Clinic, it was determined that  several classes at our middle school site will focus strictly on the Essential for Living Curriculum. Part of the rationale  for this strategic decision was the understanding that the middle school site was receiving students from what were  strong VB programs across P231K. The concern was that focusing strictly on academic skills meant that some students  would be left behind. With Essential For Living, as an organization we are focusing on tasks that lead to an increased  quality of life for all of our students. The EFL program focuses on eight essential skills...plus one. The eight skills are 1.  Requesting/Manding 2. Releasing a preferred item. 3. Accepting wait. 4. Accepting no. 5. Completing Tasks 6. Task  analysis. 7. Tolerating 8. Following directions Plus one. Method of speaking. To support the program across 2018-2019  the cabinet has identified inter-visitations, district based training and we are currently working with the district office  to schedule a September training for staff. The one-day training for staff will include learning the quick assessment, an  introduction to VB principles and Skinner theory, pairing and requesting and introduction to the Essential 8, plus one.

P231K extends an open invitation to parents to visit their child’s Verbal Behavior/EFL classrooms at any point with an  appointment. Parents are encouraged to continually communicate with their child’s teacher, Verbal Behavior coach,  and/or related service providers by setting up in-person meetings, phone conferences, and through communication  logs.

Our teachers encourage all parents to continue many of these  procedures and practices at home.   During Verbal Behavior Academy, school staff consisting of teachers, VB coach, and a Unit Coordinator, collaborate to  identify strategies to engage families and obtain their input and feedback. Such strategies include drafting parent  letters and surveys, as well as creating materials and resources that can be sent home to help parents implement  strategies being used in school. The letters help inform parents of what is taking place in school, while the surveys  help teachers identify skills parents would like the school to work on with their child. Resources and materials help  ensure what is worked on in school is carried over to the home environment. In the past, resources have included a  video library and teacher-created communication books. Overall, Verbal Behavior academy helps foster a strong  relationship and rapport between the school and students’ families.   P231 K offers parents many opportunities to share many of the structures and routines with parents and guardians. In  addition, administrators, teachers and related service providers offer parent trainings over the course of the school  year during the Principals’ Lunch (a monthly meeting with parents), the Title III ELL After School Program, as well as  other parent-centered events across the school year.

Effective School Leadership:   In 2017-2018, P231K administrative cabinet created a Committee to implement an independence program. The  purpose of the committee was to provide P231K’s students with the necessary instruction and support services they  need to become integrated into society as independent and self-advocating adults. Our focus this past year was to  provide our students with the education and preparation they needed to transition into a fulfilling and independent  adult life, where they are able to fully participate in family and community life. During this school year, the committee  piloted successful teaching protocols for three common independence needs (functional communication, toilet  training, and tolerating a variety of foods) in select classrooms. These topics were selected in collaboration with  P231K teachers, administrators, and the P231K PTA. In addition, we reviewed our IEP writing practices around  transition skills, and created PD opportunities for all teachers to enhance the quality of our students’ IEP evaluations  and transition skills. Finally, the committee established several training sessions for P231K parents, successfully  empowering them to enhance their child’s independence and support their child’s self-advocacy.    Administration conducted a survey of teachers, parents, and school based coaches to determine the skills students  are lacking and need to acquire to be successful as they transition to older grades. Based on the survey,  administration created an assessment that incorporates the identified areas such as: making requests, functional  communication, waiting when access to a preferred item/activity is delayed, accepting removals, making transitions,  sharing, taking turns, accepting “no,” following directions related to health and safety, completing daily living skills,  and tolerating situations related to health and safety.   Based on the survey, the assessment will be given to all students. Student's independence skills that need to be  acquired to be successful will be identified based on the assessment data. Teachers will use SANDI, ABLLS-R and  Essential for Living Units of Study created based on data to provide instruction to increase student independence.  Three times per year teachers will assess these skills and scores will be sent to the Data Instructional Cabinet. This  increased level of data tracking will allow us to identify target students missing key independence skills, as well as  reflect on which interventions are most successful in teaching independence skills.   The Instructional Focus for the 2018-2019 school year tracks the ability of children to navigate through multiple  teaching stations across the day. In order for children to be successful, the administrative Cabinet in conjunction with  Verbal Behavior coaches have identified three target skills from the Adaptive Daily Living Skills section of the S.A.N.D.I.  assessment (specifically items 35, 75, and 76) and three target skills from the ABLLS-r Assessment (specifically items  N1, N9 and M7) which support student success in transitioning.

Include  the  timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  In order to create conditions that foster and sustain ongoing family-school partnerships, the following school  structures are in place at both systematic and school levels to articulate the processes of effective school leadership in  multiple opportunities and facets presented to our parents. Our Parent Coordinator hosts a number of opportunities  for parents in which school leadership and the facilitators of workshops (selected teachers, OTs, PTs, Speech  Providers) apply the processes of distributive leadership to create active and ongoing partnerships that enhance the  school community and contribute the the organization in a positive way.    Monthly events include: Sip and Chat, Lunch with the Principal, Family Saturday's and Family Fun Friday's that each  offer a unique experience for parents to engage with the school community and a platform to communicate the  effective leadership throughout the organization.    Sip and Chat (monthly): The Sip and Chat is a forum designed for parent support in which parents within our  organization meet on a regular basis to share challenges and offer solutions in a non-threatening way. Often, the  Parent Coordinator or Principal will select a parent to facilitate the meeting as a source of distributive leadership.    Principal's Lunch (monthly): The vision of the school is shared on a consistent basis with the parents through the  Principals Lunch in with Ms. Elizabeth Rueda meets personally with parents and communicates ongoing events,  effectiveness of programs, and the current climate of the individual sites.    Family Fun Friday's (monthly): P231K extends an open invitation to parents to visit their children’s classroom at any  point with an appointment. In addition, Family Fun Fridays (every Friday for once a month), presents an ideal  opportunity to our internal school community to share many of the structures and routines with parents and  guardians experience the curricula that helps to facilitate the social and academic success of our students while in  school. Our teachers encourage all parents to continue many of these practices at home.         Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   0    0    0    0    0      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS231K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS231K will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   -providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   -providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   -fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   -providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments   -sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      -providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   -actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   -engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   -ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   -support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

In an  effort to support our English Language Learners, we have designed an after-school program that  will teach literacy through the study of fairy tales. Based on the 2018 NYSESLAT scores, our  students struggle significantly with reading comprehension, therefore this will be a focus in our  program.  Our after-school literacy program for English Language Learners is called, "Once Upon a  Time..." and will focus on developing phonemic awareness and comprehension. It is intended to  support the development of English literacy.  The program's theme and central focus, exploring  fairy tales, will benefit all our participating students in improving reading, writing, and literacy  skills by exposing them to a variety of texts and offering them opportunities to create their own  authentic texts.  Additionally, the ELL after-school program will use a multi-sensory approach  that includes the use of technology, infusion of the arts, and augmentative communication.   Supplies and materials such as art supplies (paints, markers, brushes, paper, etc.) and books of  fairy tales will be ordered for use in the program. Extra copies of the books read in the program  will be purchased for parents to read with their students at home. Additionally we will purchase a  license for Reading A-Z that will be used to enhance instruction.  To further support instruction, Shadow Box Theatre, an outside vendor, will provide seven  sessions in which they will teach students about puppet building and set direction. They will  refer to the fairy tales read during the program to create an end-of-program show where students  will be able to showcase their work and learning for parents and peers.  The after-school program will run for 2 hours from 3:30- 5:30 pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays  for 14 weeks (for a total of 28 sessions), beginning in January 2019. There will be one state- certified ELL Teacher and one state-certified Special Education Teacher who will collaborate  and deliver instruction (in English) through a co-teaching model, just as instruction is delivered  during the regular school day. Additionally, there will be a paraprofessional there to provide  instructional support. Preference will be given to bilingual paraprofessionals so that native  language support may be provided to students who need it. There will be an administrator  present to supervise the program. However, s/he will be paid from a separate budget as there is  another after-school program taking place in the building at that time. Six students in grades 6-8  who are mandated for 6:1:1 instruction will participate in the program.

They will be reading The Uses of  Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales by Bruno Bettelheim.  The chapters  read will be The Child's Need For Magic, Optimism verses Pessimism, and Activating  Integration and Fantasy, Recovery, Escape and Consolation. Participating in this professional  development will provide an opportunity for all staff in the Title III Program to enhance and  enrich their knowledge of how to incorporate fairy tales into instruction for ELLs.  Each session,  the teacher, paraprofessional or Assistant Principal will alternately present the salient points of a  chapter from the book to the other members of the group and will create discussion questions  based on the book and how the chapter’s contents may be utilized during the Title III program to  support the students.

Parents will also receive the official Title III letter in their home language detailing the proposed  Title III Program.    Parents will be invited to attend after-school sessions, specifically those led by Shadow Box  Theatre, where they will learn puppet-making skills alongside their students. Additionally, they  will benefit from the English instruction provided by the ENL and Special Education teachers.  These presentations will culminate in a final show the students will put on for their peers and  parents featuring the puppets and the sets that they built based on one of the fairy tales they will  be reading throughout the program.  Parents will also be given copies of each story read and an  art kit to help support the students' literacy development at home.  Notification of the dates of the Title III program parent workshop will be sent home in the  parents’ preferred language.    Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  All English Language Learners at P231K  have special needs and Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). Lessons and materials are  differentiated on a regular basis to ensure that all content is accessible and appropriate for all students. Intervention  strategies, such as small-group instruction, SRA and Reading Mastery, EngageNY, Attainment, and SmiLE are used to support  these students' academic growth and language development. Teacher teams work collaboratively to modify ELA and Math  curriculum to allow greater access to grade level appropriate content and materials. Teachers adhere to curriculum material  adaptations for ENL and UDL principles.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?    P231K staff and our School Leadership Team (SLT) work diligently to ensure that all students work toward increasing levels of  independence and find appropriate placements in the least restrictive environment (LRE).  We closely monitor all students to  identify those who are appropriate candidates for classes with smaller staffing ratios and have identified several "bridge"  classes where students are prepared for those LRE transitions. In addition, P231K maintains an inclusion program with two of  our co-located schools:  PS/IS 180 the SEEALL Academy, and PS 264 the Bay Ridge Elementary School For The Arts.  In the  inclusion program students attend general education classes alongside their non-District 75 peers. This provides opportunities  for them to develop their language proficiency.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  As an organization we believe that best practices for English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities tend to  compliment each other.  All content area interventions are conducted in English to support ELLs. in Math we use the Math in  Focus curriculum which teaches math concepts using real-world,  hands-on experiences, and focuses on problem-solving skills.  Connecting Math Concepts (CMC) is also used as an intervention resource during block periods.    To support ELLs in ELA we use a variety of curricula as follows:  1.  First Author Writing Curriculum is used to help meet Common Core writing requirements and prepare students with  complex alternate assessment needs. The curriculum emphasizes the opportunity for students to share their written work and  communicate with others using the "Author's Chair."  2.  Language for Learning is systematically and explicitly designed to teach young children basic vocabulary, concepts, and  sentence forms.   3.  Pathways to Literacy is curriculum that uses prepared scripts to teach story-based lessons.  4.  Early Literacy Skills Builder (ELSB) is a reading skill curriculum that provides students with a variety of methods to  communicate in individual or small group settings.  Within ELSB, Building with Stories, a stand-alone program or companion to,  provides read alouds and shared stories.    5.  SRA Reading Laboratory uses prepared scripts to teach story-based lessons in order to improve reading skills.  6.  Engage NY is a data driven curriculum used in order to assist schools with the implementation of the Common   core.  The ELA and Math curricula can be adapted for Pre K-12 grade levels.    Support in other content areas, such as science and social studies, takes place through small-group instruction and one-on-one  tutoring.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    This is the third year our teachers in standardized classes have embraced the EngageNY, a Common Core-aligned curriculum  designed to support schools and teachers in the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards.  We continue to  make use of block instruction which affords teachers and students valuable time to engage with ELA and Math instruction on a  sustained basis with homogeneously groups of students across the day. For the second year in a row P231k offered a Title  III Saturday Academy format (using Creative Dramatics in 2016-2017). Based on ABLLS-r student performance data P231K’s  approach to increasing instructional effectiveness will be to promote oral language.  Looking ahead to school year 2018-2019,  our intention is to support greater achievement with an explicit focus on oral language for students identified as ELLs. This  work is informed and guided by, “Supporting ELL’s Achievement: Oral Language Unpacked” by Nonie K. Lesalix and Julie Russ  Harris in partnership with the NYC DOE Division of English Language Learners and Student Support. The packet outlines  supports for effective instruction that promote oral language         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs including assembly programs, P231K's Field Day,  School Carnival, and  district-wide programs. There are community trips to NYC libraries, local businesses, amusements, and Mayoral Special  Community events. In addition, ELLs are invited to participate in our Title III program.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Throughout the school students are exposed to materials to further support their language and content knowledge  development. These materials include, but are not limited to, teacher-made materials, adapted books, iPads, SmartBoards,  computers and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Currently, our home language support is assessed and delivered through stand alone and integrated ENL, as well as a  TBE class.   The teacher, as well as the paraprofessionals, in the TBE classroom at P231K@215 (Class Y80) provides  English instruction with Chinese support.  They are constantly delivering and assessing for understanding, as are  alternate placement paraprofessionals, which are mandated to certain ELL students with IEPs.  Students who are  served by an alternate placement paraprofessional receive native language support from a staff member throughout  the instructional day in  reading, writing, listening and speaking activities across all content areas. In addition, Myon, a  personalized digital literacy environment,  supports native language reading for students by recommending books  based on their interests, reading level, and ratings of books.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     P231K serves students from kindergarten to eighth grade.  All services and resources correspond to students’ age and  grade level. Students are exposed to materials to further support their language and content knowledge  development.  Age-appropriate materials are found throughout the school in classrooms, recreational areas and  related service offices.  These materials include, but are not limited to, teacher-made materials, adapted  books, iPads, SmartBoards, computers and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices.  As needed,  resources are adapted so that they are accessible for students while still remaining age and/or grade appropriate.  IEP mandates are also reviewed on a regular basis and teachers are encouraged to collect samples of student work  that reflects progress toward IEP goals and learning targets.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Our school is co-located in six (6) buildings across Brooklyn.  Within all of our sites, all ELLs are afforded equal access  to all school programs including assembly programs, P231K's Field Day,  School Carnival, and district-wide programs.  There are community trips to NYC libraries, local businesses, amusements, and Mayoral Special Community  events. Throughout the school students are exposed to materials to further support their language and content  knowledge development. These materials include, but are not limited to, teacher-made materials, adapted  books, iPads, SmartBoards, computers and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   P231K presents Curriculum Night at the start of the school year that provides parents and students with the opportunity to  meet with the classroom teacher, ENL teachers, cluster teachers, paraprofessionals, and related services providers for their  child.  This event is organized by the P231k Parent Coordinator (S. Calakos) with support from the Parent Teacher Association  (President Julia Reavely ), P231K's   administration and teaching staff. the event is offered during the evening hours to allow  the greatest number of families to attend. In addition, the school has monthly Parent Meetings and Lunch with the Principal  events.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   N/A     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The dual language model that is used is self-contained TBE.  The classroom at one of our sites consists of six Chinese dominant  speaking students.  It is conducted with a 60-40 continuum of L1 (first language) to L2 (second language).  All content area  instruction is taught in English with Chinese support.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    The ENL teachers participate in district-sponsored ELL professional development workshops throughout the school year. Other  teachers, including classroom teachers and cluster teachers, are invited to teacher team meetings in which the ENL teachers  will turnkey information and resources gathered at said workshops. Additionally, a district-based ELL coach provides ongoing  support to the ENL teachers throughout the school year. Moreover, alll teachers at P231K attend professional development  workshops on designated days in November and June. These workshops are designed to support teachers in using the  Common Core Learning Standards in their lessons. Tentative PD content may including the following:  1. Building Relationships to Support Behavior Management  2. Managing Classroom Staff to Support Highly Effective Instruction,  3. Conflict Resolution in the Classroom, and    4. Teaching Social Studies to Increase Student Independence.  All these presentations offer unique opportunities to address the individual needs to students identified as ELLs. Based on the  above referenced student performance data, P231K’s approach to increasing instructional effectiveness is to promote oral  language.  Looking ahead to school year 2018-2019, our intention is to support greater achievement with an explicit focus on  oral language for students identified as ELLs. This work is informed and guided by, “Supporting ELL’s Achievement: Oral  Language Unpacked” by Nonie K.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, 06/28/17, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and  staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
