This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Our Mission statement is:    To achieve our vision, we endeavor to foster an educational environment which takes into account the needs, interest  and abilities of the individual student. Our responsibility is to promote positive self- awareness among our students  today and to develop those educational skills, which will maximize and enhance the potential for student academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      achievement in all areas. We will provide a high quality education through standards based instruction in order to  prepare our students to meet daily academic challenges.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P 188X, is a Pre-K through 12 District 75 school, dedicated to teaching a diverse population of students with varying  abilities and Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). We are a multi-sited organization with a self-contained main site,  P34, ranging from PK- 8 th grades; a co-located Middle School at M.S. 301 campus, with grades 6-8; and a High School  Site, H790/H527 located on the Mott Haven Campus serving grades 9-12 self-contained and 9-12 inclusion students in  collaboration with Bronx Leadership Academy II High School (BLA II). The school population comprises 37% Black, 54%  Hispanic, 4% White, 2% Asian, and 2% other. The student body includes 24% English language learners and 100%  special education students. Males account for 72% of the students enrolled and females account for 28%. We have a  88% alternate assessment population and 12% standardized assessment population. Our students have autism,  varying intellectual abilities, physical and emotional developmental delays. Our students require related services to  support varying developmental deficits via speech and language, physical, and occupational therapies along with  hearing and vision services. Some students receive guidance and counseling to support their social and emotional  needs.    Our educational focus is on project based learning and pre-vocational training aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) with emphasis on Social Emotional Learning (SEL). Career Development and Occupational Studies  (CDOS) is embedded in our curriculum. We value real world application within our classrooms, web and e-based  curricula and programs, differentiated, student-centered instruction aligned to the Danielson Framework. CCLS  aligned curricula and programs support and enhance student learning outcomes across the organization. P188X  continues to integrate technology in our classrooms and provide challenging interdisciplinary learning opportunities.   Our vision statement is:    We believe that all students can learn and are entitled to be provided with the best education possible.   We have partnerships with the New York Public Library (NYPL), Child Abuse Prevention Program (CAPP), the Goodwill  Industries, Co-op Tech, Advanced Placement for All (AP for All), The Round Star Foundation, Generation On, Promise  Grant Initiative, Planned Parenthood, Penny Harvest, American Diabetes Foundation, Urban Advantage, Office of  People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD), The Randall's Island Park Alliance, Marquis Studios, Arts Horizons,  The Edible Schoolyard New York City (NYC), Groundswell, Broadway Jr., and the NYC Middle School After School  Program. These partnerships and organizations provide support to our students, staff, and families through  Transitional Programming, Professional Development, workshops, the Arts, and other unique offerings.      This year we will enter year two of our collaboration with Broadway Jr. The P188X school's theme for 2017-2018  school year "Systems for Success" provided students an opportunity to explore, government, business ownership  effective communication and entrepreneurial leadership through our interdisciplinary curriculum map. The students  created businesses and learned about merchandising, advertisement, entrepreneurial development, supply and  demand, currency, and pricing.       The students continue to explore different genres in art/literacy through the use of color, texture, set creation, multi- sensory integration in visual and performing arts. The students are looking forward to participating in the 4th annual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      District 75 Arts Festival. Arts integration is at the core of the work we do with our students. Our collaboration with  Broadway Jr., Marquis Studios and Arts Horizons enhances our student creativity and content exploration.    The level of student engagement and ownership in arts has been phenomenal. . The students transform into  characters and re-create stories they will remember forever through School House Rock the Musical. Students  capitalized on progress toward Speech and Language Therapy (SP), Occupational Therapy (OT) and Physical Therapy  (PT) goal acquisition in addition to IEP goal attainment. Our visual arts teachers have also had student work displayed  outside the organization at the Bronx Art Museum. Art integration is at the crux of the work we do.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   All students have Individualized Education Plans, IEPs. They have specific goals created in conjunction with the school  and home partnership. The students' needs are identified and goals are created based on the students' present levels  of performance to ensure our goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timebound (SMART). Student  learning goals are embedding in instruction and we utilize Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Differentiation, and  Specially Designed Instruction (SDI) to meet student needs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 school year, P188X has made the most progress in Curriculum (1.1), Assessment (2.2), High  Expectations (3.4), and Teacher Support and Supervision (4.1) as evidenced by our Quality Review. The organization  maintained a well-developed in 1.1. additionally 2.2, 3.4, and 4.1. were noted as well developed areas. P188X  continues to utilize curricula and programs to support overall instruction. Thus, positively impacting on student  academic achievement. The following was noted in our 2017-2018 Quality Review Report dated November 2-3, 2017:      Findings:  Across the vast majority of classrooms, teachers create and use assessments and rubrics that are aligned with the  school’s curricula. The school also uses common assessment such as the New York State Alternate Assessment  (NYSAA), Formative Assessment of Standards Task (SANDI-FAST), and Measures of Student Learning (MOSL), to create  a clear picture of student progress towards meeting goals.     Impact:  High quality assessment practices provide actionable and meaningful feedback to students and teachers regarding  student achievement. Analysis of common assessments drive curricular and instructional decisions at the team and  classroom level resulting in all students demonstrating increased mastery.  Supporting Evidence      Across the school, teachers consistently use rubrics and checklists that are aligned with the curricula and modified  for student use, to provide students with written feedback on what they did well, need to focus on, and actionable  next steps in order to improve. Evidence of students’ use of these tools is posted on classroom walls, in work folders,  and reported by the students themselves. One student commented that feedback has helped him “use critical  thinking and work with integrity” while another student spoke about how teachers’ feedback focused his “thinking  about next steps.” Other examples include an early-childhood student who was given feedback on skipping lines to  help with neatness while another was given feedback on using appropriate colors. In the upper elementary and  middle school grades, students were given feedback on their use of academic vocabulary, text-based evidence, and  organization. A student work sample evidenced how a student made meaning from actionable feedback he was given  on using a number line as a strategy to solve subtraction problems.

Based on Quality Review, School Leadership Team (SLT) and Principal's Performance Observations (PPO) feedback our  focus area will be on 1.2 pedagogy. We will continue to focus our efforts in Domains 1 and 3 of the Danielson’s  Framework. Our instructional focus, "If we design coherent instruction then we will impact our questioning and  discussion techniques, students will show improvements in their higher order thinking and communication skills. This  will lead to better student outcomes." As per Deputy Superintendent, Klainberg, "P188X will continue to provide  opportunities to evaluate all aspects of instructional, organizational, curricular and behavioral decisions on a regular  basis to facilitate an informed decision making process to meet the diverse learning needs of the students and  teachers ." We endeavor to meet the aforementioned expectations to improve the quality of instruction, school  culture and climate along with student achievement.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75X188   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,01,02,03,04,05, 06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)   468   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Based on a comprehensive review of data, we analyzed student achievement trends based on students’ grade level,  subject area and service category. We focused on information gleaned from the results of our Learning Environment  Survey, student attendance; school needs assessment surveys, and effectiveness of Social Emotional Learning (SEL)  curriculum and instruction.    2017-2018 NYC School Survey:     99% of parents of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that at their school their child is safe.     91% of students say that students are safe in the hallways , bathrooms, locker room, and cafeteria.    82% students agreed or strongly agreed that discipline is applied fairly in their school.     96% of parents agreed or strongly agreed that their child's school will make them aware if there are any   emotional or psychological issues affecting their child's academic performance.      84% of students say that most students follow the rules in class.     90% of teachers sy that order and discipline are maintained at their school.        School Wide Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) Initiative:    ● Our PBIS team is an interdisciplinary multi-sited team. The team includes all constituents: paraprofessionals, related  service providers, teachers, and administration. Our school stores at all sites opened.

New teacher development is critically important. The retention and development of new teachers is an important  aspect of student achievement. The impact of ongoing training, development and support for new teachers is  extremely important for the organization’s continued success.       Based on research data one of the primary reasons for new teacher dissatisfaction is a lack of support and adequate  training. In alignment with Capacity Framework Element 5D nurturing professional growth is paramount.       Advance Data Denoted :   ● 2.78 is the rating distribution in the area of 3b.   ● 2.89 is the rating distribution in the area of 3d.     2.78 is the rating distribution in Domain 3.     83% of our 1st, 2nd and 3rd year teachers MOTP were highly effective/effective.     3.04 is the rating distribution in all areas.    100% of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year teachers will be retuning to date.    8% of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year teachers have an MOTP rating of HE.     75% of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year teachers have an MOTP rating of E.    New Teacher Induction Committee Denoted :   ● Teacher feedback surveys from the New Teacher Induction Committee yielded high response rates for continued  support and PD.      New teachers have noted 15 hours was ample PD time to support their acclimation and learning needs in   addition to observational feedback.    Quality Review Data November 2-3, 2017 Denoted:    The school provides PD for teachers around high expectations. Teachers were provided with PD on using the Live  Binder. Teachers reported that they feel their professional development needs are consistently met. One teacher  reported that the recent PD on looking at data helped her. She stated, “I was really struggling with understanding how   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      to disaggregate, analyze, and then use data to individualize my lessons and this got me to finally understand how to  do it.” Other teachers concurred and said that with their instruction being more targeted from disaggregating the  data, they are starting to see increased growth in the quality of students’ use of language as evidenced on work  samples.   PPO Feedback Denoted:      To support staff development and training, you are ensuring that all first and second year teachers receive 20   hours of professional development through your 6 half day PDs and June PD day. School-wide, you have  currently implemented 13.5 hours of professional development, with two more half days (5 hours) and one  more full day to come. As an indicator of the impact of these trainings on instructional practice, 71% of your  2nd year teachers are currently trending Effective, as well as 59% of first year teachers. You expect to meet the  80% effectiveness target for teachers in their first two years set in your CEP goal.       Based on the aforementioned data our school will continue to prioritize the retention of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year  teachers new to the organization by providing 20 hours of professional development. These essential trainings will  enhance pedagogical skills and assist with targeted feedback to teachers during the observation cycles. Inter-visitation  based on Option 3 will also support these teachers in identified areas areas for improvement for pedagogical growth  and effective teacher ratings.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 75X188, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      75X188 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   75X188, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

P.188X serves  students in grades Pre-K through High School, all with Individualized Education Programs  (IEPs). Official school hours are from 8:10am-3:00pm. The official hours of the administrator  serving our Title III program, are 7:30-3:30. Our students are classified with Autism, Intellectual  Disabilities, and other severe mental and physical delays. SIFEs receive AIS tutoring, native  language literacy development, and  are offered participation in the Title III program.  All of  188X’s students have special needs and receive instruction and services in line with their IEP  mandates during Title III instruction. At school orientation and new enrollment intakes, ELLs  and their parents are invited, in their native language if requested (through oral or written  communication by qualified bilingual staff), to participate in the Title III after-school program,  which meets on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 3:05-5:05 for 13 sessions from February  through April. We include our elementary school to provide intervention for low performing  ELLs with 20 students identified in grades 3-5 at the elementary school (12:1:1 and 8:1:1 student  mandated ratios) supported by ENL and Bilingual licensed pedagogues and bilingual  paraprofessionals.  These students are targeted for the Title III program because they all are at  the entering, emerging, and transitioning level of English Language Proficiency on the  NYSESLAT and have scored on levels 1 and 2  and on the intermediate level in alternate  (NYSAA) and / or standardized assessment (NYS ELA Exam).    Trained in ENL techniques, two certified ENL teachers and a bilingual guidance counselor will  facilitate the program for students using effective scaffolding, differentiation and ENL  methodologies such as The Natural Approach, Total Physical Response (TPR), Whole Language,  and the use of graphic organizers in a collaborative team teaching setting which will be  supported by two bilingual paraprofessionals. The two ENL teachers will work collaboratively to  design and deliver a performing arts / theater oriented experience for participating students using  the fore-mentioned strategies while the bilingual guidance counselor will focus on developing  communication and understanding of emotions and self for student based theater performances.  The language of instruction for the Title III Program will be  English. Students in the after school  program will be assessed through the use of performance-based rubrics which are designed by  our ENL staff, benchmarks and assessment of their final project. This aligns with New Language  Arts Progressions 1, 2, 3 and 5. ENL rubrics are also utilized in the evaluation process of  students’ work.  We also utilize picture symbol usage charts, AAC device logs, and IPads to  support instruction and language acquisition. We are incorporating theatre and dance into our  after school program because “the arts naturally lend themselves to multicultural and visual  teaching and learning, which enhance LEP/ELLs access to language acquisition and cross- cultural education.” (New York State Education Department, www.p12.nysed.gov) “The arts are  an integral part of authentic learning; the heart and soul that complement mind and body, a  powerful integrative force that teaches the whole child—social, creative, emotional, intellectual,  and physical.” (LeFrancois, Psychology for Teaching, pg. 499). In this manner, language needs  of our ELLs will be addressed through experiences in the performing arts.

The program provides students with the opportunity to develop theater skills and arts  experiences that connect with Common Core capacities and New Language Arts Progressions  while emphasizing instruction in the four language modalities for our ELLs.     This year, we will renew our subscription to Brain Pop ENL to support instruction for the  program as well as four iPads and two Apple Pencils to develop literacy skills for our ELLs. The  Brainpop subscription will be utilized for ongoing instructional support for the program. The  iPad tablets will be utilized by the two teachers as well as the paraprofessional to support  instruction during the TITLE III program by running the Brainpop program in small targeted  groups and recording as well as storing student multimedia project information.  The Apple  Pencils will assist students in developing written language skills when used in conjunction with  the iPads. Research indicates that using technology with ELLs is an effective way to enhance  English language acquisition skills: “[Technology] prevents the academic and social  marginalization of ELLs.  [It is] motivating and non-judgmental.  [It] allows them to have the  most control over the direction of their learning by controlling their time, speed of learning,  autonomy, choice of topics or even their own identity.  [It] gives them prompt feedback,  individualizes their learning, and tailors the instructional sequence.” - Critical Issue: Using  Technology to Support Limited-English-Proficient (LEP) Students’ Learning Experiences (2003)   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Professional development for staff working with ELLs is vital to any school, according to  linguist and researcher Jim Cummins, who states that, "ongoing dialogue regarding  multilingualism via professional learning communities" are key to developing a population of  successful ELL's. In fact, research shows that inspiring and informed teachers are the most  important school-related factor influencing student achievement, so it is critical to pay close  attention to how we train and support both new and experienced educators. Title III funds will be  utilized for 188X's Title III staff working with ELLs (2 ENL teachers, 2 bilingual  paraprofessionals, 1 Bilingual Guidance Counselor and 1 administrator). The staff will  participate in 4 monthly after-school ELL professional development seminars.  Each meeting  will focus on developing ELL proficiencies in a different language modality: Developing  Effective Practices for the Promotion of Spoken Language for ELLs (January),  Developing  Effective Practices for the Promotion of Auditory Language Acquisition (February), Developing  Effective Practices to Promote Reading Strategies for ELLs (March), Developing Effective  Practices to Promote Writing Strategies for ELLs (April).  Each workshop will be led in equal  parts by participating pedagogues, support staff, and pedagogical supervisors.  Monthly  professional development opportunities are held on the second Monday of the month, beginning  in January, commencing one week prior to the start of the instructional program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  188X uses the ECLAS-2 to assess early literacy skills and SANDI for Alternate Assessment K-8 ELLs.  The data shows lower  literacy skills, which is then targeted. Teachers review the proficiency levels in Speaking, Reading, Listening, and Writing to  better target the areas in which students need to develop their skill sets.  The Transitional Bilingual Class uses Estrellita  program and assessments. Throughout the whole school, SANDI (Student Annual Needs Determination Inventories) are used  in order identify instructional levels and entry points for all ELLs, to which teachers are able to identify student individualized  goals and student instructional groups.            2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      The structures used to support the acquisition and application of data include but are not limited to: School-Created  Checklist(s) assessment which outlines indicators of proficiency across all four domains of language, Student Annual Needs  Determination Inventories (SANDI), periodic assessments created on the school level using SANDI and CCLS tasks from NYSAA  as a guideline, six progress monitoring periods when teachers analyze data to make conclusions on progress and ascertain if  current goals have been met or need modification, portfolios and teacher created materials additionally are used to monitor  student progression across the program. Acceptable Yearly Progress is determined through student scores on the NYSAA  examination that outlines student progression within the core content areas in all testing modalities when students are  assessed at their given age. NYSESLAT progression is considered when applicable to students who are able to receive a  reportable score in all modalities and their progress is measured using decision level and raw score data. Students are  primarily assessed for progression in the language arts from the SANDI raw score data in conjunction with progression toward  meeting individual IEP goals. Student progress is then considered for ELL groups, sub-groups, and individuals.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments used by 188X include NYSESLAT, NYSAA, and State ELA and Math tests.. On- going assessments are  also an important component of determining student progress in our ELL program. This includes but is not limited to: teacher  created checklist assessment which outlines student progress in ELA progress, Student Annual Needs Determination  Inventories (SANDI), periodic assessments created on the school level using SANDI and CCLS tasks from NYSAA as a guideline,  FAST assessments, portfolios and teacher created materials additionally are used to monitor student progression across the  program.             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In order to address interventions based on the data from our measurement systems, the school leadership team reviews and  identifies programs and processes that had a positive impact on student learning and identify improvement systems when  forecasting needs and interventions in the Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) for the upcoming year. Summative data from  SANDI and the school curriculum is also utilized by classroom teachers to complete the student placement protocol to align  student academic levels and  provides ongoing information about individual and group progression in content area mastery  in four reporting periods when teachers analyze data to make conclusions on progress and ascertain if current goals have been  met or need modification. Furthermore, student progression in academics from on-going assessments such as SANDI / FAST  and curriculum is discussed routinely at administrative cabinet and School Leadership Team meetings aligned to the CEP goals  to further identify ways to support student development.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   SANDI / FAST, Curriculum, and NYSAA data indicates where intensive levels of targeted instruction are to be provided to  address the needs of individual students demonstrating sub-standard progress in any of the core areas of study. We utilize  achievement testing information from NYSESLAT, NYSAA, and SANDI / FAST to determine which individual students and  student groups require more intensive interventions as they relate to student achievement. The assessments mentioned  above allow us to consider each individual student's degree of proficiency in language development. We further compliment  our assessment of each individual child with a highly adaptable curriculum that accounts for individual student needs. In these  ways our operations reflect best practices as outlined in the RTI.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We utilize a combination of the SANDI, NYSAA, and teacher made assessments, rubrics and checklists in order to evaluate and  inform our ELL programs.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         The school leadership team reviews the data from NYSESLAT and class and individual student progress in the SANDI  assessment to make determinations as to student levels for instructional grouping. School leadership additionally references  behavior data from PBIS and OORS to make determinations as to appropriate settings for students such as work readiness  / pre-vocational programs on the secondary level as well as change in possible class size settings and needs for reduction or  increase in individual interventions or supports. Teachers additionally evaluate individual student performance using SANDI,  teacher made assessments, and behavior data to make recommendations for program placement as well as identify program  changes at the beginning, mid, and end of year benchmarks.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   188X’s ELLs are spread out are over thirteen different grade levels (K-12) with varied class-size mandates (6:1:1, 8:1:1,  12:1:1), different English language proficiencies and differing abilities (ED, ID, Autistic, Multiple Disabilities) at three  separate sites.  ELLs receive ENL with native-language alternate placement para-professionals present in all  classes.  We employ a freestanding ENL program which primarily utilizes the integrated model (188@34) and an  integrated/stand-alone combination (188@301, 188@790) due to specific student needs. Our ELLs are grouped with  regard to their class-size mandate (6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1), English language proficiencies, and testing categorization  (Standard, Alternate).  The program model is ungraded, heterogeneous integrated and stand-alone.The ENL teachers  instruct, utilizing ENL methodologies in both the stand alone and integration services and will support language  development needs for ELLs who have been formerly X-Coded when integrating instruction in classes.  Newcomer and  Entering level ELLs are additionally prioritized within ENL provider caseloads n order to ensure equity for students  who require more urgent remediation and services since our students are alternate assessment and in many cases  cannot demonstrate progression under the NYSESLAT examination system.  All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years  after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We offer a 3-5 grade Transitional Bilingual Class.  The transitional bilingual program has 1) an ENL component  designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English;  2) a minimum of 2 content-area  courses/subjects (Math, Science) in the home language and English at the entering and emerging levels;  3) a home  language arts (HLA) component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students’  home language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture. ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes  are delivered as per CR Part 154. The home language arts component is delivered through the core content areas  *except during ELA instruction by the bilingual certified teacher to which Home Language Arts instruction is delivered  in conjunction with mathematics and social studies. The TBE program is additionally supported by an ENL teacher  assigned to the class to devliver the ENL mandated minutes as per CR Part 154. In the TBE program, students are  grouped along levels of cognition and student IEP mandated ratios in order to group students as homogeneously as  possible to aid instruction. Students are additionally assigned to TBE class based on three contiguous grade levels. All  Bilingual mandated ELLs that do not have a placement within a TBE class are assigned an Alternate Placement  Paraprofessional in order to assure language development and coherence in both their new and home languages as  well as support communication efforts regarding instruction between the school and home environments.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes are delivered as per CR Part 154"; in TBE, subject areas should be alternately taught  in Spanish and English (ENL component of instruction).       In grades K-8, Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA, 0 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated  Content-Area ENL, totaling 360 minutes total per week. Emerging ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA, 90  minutes of Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated Content-Area ENL, totaling 360 minutes total per week.  Transitioning ELLs receive  90 minutes of ENL/Content Area, 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated Content-Area ENL, totaling 180 minutes total  per week.  Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL/Content Area, totaling 180 minutes total per week.  Commanding ELLs  receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in ELA/Content Area, totaling 90 minutes total per week.      In grades 9-12, Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of ENL/ELA, 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL or  Integrated Content-Area ENL, totaling 540 minutes total per week. Emerging ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL, 180 minutes of  ENL/ELA, 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated Content-Area ENL, totaling 360 minutes total per week.  Transitioning  ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL/Content Area, 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated Content-Area ENL, totaling 180  minutes total per week.  Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL/Content Area, totaling 180 minutes total per  week.  Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in ELA/Content Area, totaling 90 minutes total per week.      In the TBE program, both HLA and subject areas are taught in the home language, Spanish.  HLA support is delivered through  the mathematics, sciences, or social studies core content areas.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ELL teachers utilize classroom and content area texts/materials for instruction.  For standardized assessment students,  Connected Mathematics (Math), BrainPop (Social Studies, Science), and Codex (ELA) are regularly used.  With alternate  assessment students, Math In Focus (Math), BrainPop (Social Studies, Science), Starfall (Literacy) and the D75 Alternate  Assessment Curriculum Framework (ELA,Math) are used.  ENL materials include leveled readers (Penguin), photo dictionaries  (Longman), Word by Word (Longman), and Moving Into English (Harcourt). ENL teachers will push-in and collaborate with  content area instruction. ENL providers are scheduled to maximize ELL instructional groups.      All Bilingual instruction is Common Core-aligned to accelerate student achievement.  The transitional bilingual program has 1)  an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English;  2) a minimum of 2 content- area courses/subjects (Math, Science) in the home language and English at the entering and emerging levels;  3) a home  language arts (HLA) component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students’ home  language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture. ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes are delivered  as per CR Part 154. The languages of instruction are English and Spanish.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      188X uses Estrellita program and formal and informal diagnostic assessments as well as native language Brigance to evaluate  native language throughout the year. The assessment is utilized to evaluate each child's language development in their native  language to provide entry point information for language transfer and identify goals for improvement by the instructor.               5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   a.   SIFE     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Services for newcomers include AIS tutoring, developing literacy skills, and providing a nurturing environment to facilitate  language production.  SIFEs receive AIS tutoring and native language literacy development.  Extension of Service (more than 3,  but less than 6 years of service) are recommended for tutoring, developing literacy skills, academic intervention, and providing  an environment to facilitate language production. SIFE and newcomer students often are assigned priority caseloads within  our ENL and Bilingual programs. In this manner we try to ensure their development of their new language skills quickly while  reinforcing instruction within their home language. Additionally, newcomer and SIFE students are immediately assessed for  their levels of skill attainment in all four modalities and in other academic and social fields utilizing the SANDI system in order  to appropriately place them homogeneously within classes amongst their peers. Newcomer and SIFE ELLs additionally often  are assigned an alternate placement paraprofessional to promote language acquisition and transfer of knowledge from the  home language into their new language. Students additionally work toward individual benchmark goals for language  development which are tracked and monitored by their ENL and Bilingual providers. Students curriculum is adapted to meet  the individual student needs based on learning style, level of achievement, and assistive technology and other IEP based  accommodations as necessary. Developing ELLs are provided all of the same considerations as Newcomer and SIFE students  and are additionally placed within priority caseloads as well as provided the same adaptations. Our school provides services for  long term ELLs for as long as they need it and according to their IEPs. The majority of our Long Term ELLs have made great  gains in their English Language Proficiency but are unable to demonstrate this on NYSESLAT due to the nature of their  disabilities. Long Term ELLs (6+ years of service) receive AIS interventions, literacy coaching, Title III participation. All 188X's  students have special needs and receive instruction, services in line with their IEP mandates.  Students who have transitioned  out of the ENL program (former ELLs) are included in ENL groupings for two years, with 90 minutes weekly, and continue to  receive ELL testing accommodations for two years following entitlement.             6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Instruction is focused on development and support of access/foundation skills such as functional communication approaches  for ELLs with severe communication disabilities.Teachers utilize grade and age-appropriate classroom and content area  texts/materials for instruction.  For standardized assessment students, Connected Mathematics (Math), BrainPop (Social  Studies, Science), and Codex (ELA) are regularly used.  With alternate assessment students, Math In Focus (Math), BrainPop  (Social Studies, Science), Starfall (Literacy) and the D75 Alternate Assessment Curriculum Framework (ELA, Math) are used.  ESL  materials include leveled readers (Penguin), photo dictionaries (Longman), Word by Word (Longman), and Moving Into English  (Harcourt).  ELLs are not pulled out of content area classes to prevent interfering with test preparation and content area  learning. ESL teachers will push-in and collaborate with content area instruction. In TBE, the Estrellita program is used.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  As our school is entirely comprised of students with special education mandates all ELL students naturally receive  accommodations for program needs for their disability diagnosis, mandated class size ratio as well as related services such as  speech, counseling, physical therapy and occupational therapy. 188X uses flexible scheduling to maximize English language  development with native language support so that students develop language and content knowledge in English while  achieving their IEP goals in the least restrictive environment. Student goals in all ELA modalities are created for each student  on an annual basis in conjunction with student ENL providers based off of individual student needs derived from SANDI  baseline assessments. Student progression is monitored between the classroom and ENL teacher respectively to determine  goal achievement. Instructional flexibility is determined by the teacher and ENL provider to make appropriate adaptations to  each student's learning experience so that they may achieve their individual goals which are embedded within our curriculum.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For ELA intervention, we use: Fundations, Wilson Language, Preventing Academic Failure (PAF), Reading A to Z, SMILE, Unique,  Edmark, and Edperformance. For Math intervention, we use Go Math, Touch Math, and Edperformance.  For Science  intervention, we use FOSS kits, Brain Pop, and Brain Pop Jr.  For Social Studies intervention, we use informational text, Brain  Pop, and Brain Pop Jr. All curriculum is adapted to suit the learning style and language development needs of all students, and  is additionally further adapted to student home language as applicable by Bilingual staff and alternate placement  paraprofessionals in their home language.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year 188X is considering using BrainPop ESL for the upcoming school year to reinforce instruction in the core content  areas for our Bilingual and beginner level ELLs in order to promote language transfer skills aligned to core  instruction. Additionally, literacy support staff and school based coaches will be involved in preparing students for the  NYSESLAT examination through targeting interventions to support learners in each of the four assessed modalities .     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There are no ELL programs/services scheduled for discontinuation.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  ELLs are invited, by parent/guardian letter in their preferred language,  to participate in the Title III ELL after school program which is designed to promote language skills for ELLs through the arts as  well as the Middle School After School Program which is designed to promote academic skills in the core content areas as a  supplement to their daily instruction. We will not discontinue any existing programs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Teachers utilize grade and age-appropriate classroom and content area texts/materials for instruction.  For standardized  assessment students, Connected Mathematics (Math), BrainPop (Social Studies, Science), and Codex (ELA) are regularly  used.  With alternate assessment students, Math In Focus (Math), BrainPop (Social Studies, Science), Starfall (Literacy) and the  D75 Alternate Assessment Curriculum Farmework (ELA, Math) are used.  ESL materials include leveled readers (Penguin),  photo dictionaries (Longman), Word by Word (Longman), and Moving Into English (Harcourt).  ELLs are not pulled out of  content area classes to prevent interfering with test preparation and content area learning. ENL teachers will push-in and  collaborate with content area instruction. In TBE, the Estrellita program is used.  188X has Smartboards, desktop computers,  laptop carts, and tablets to support ELLs.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The students literacy skills in their Native Language varies based on abilities and cognitive delays and the teachers use  differentiated instruction to met their individual needs. Home Language support needs for our TBE classroom is assessed  through student achievement information based off of teacher observation and data collection in regards to our curriculum as  well as NYSESLAT achievement levels of each student and necessary IEP driven supports. Furthermore, in the TBE model, 188X  uses the Estrelitta program as well as native language books, manipulative, and A-Z Books online to support students in their  native language.  All paraprofessionals speak the native language and provide ongoing support throughout the day.  One  period of Native Language instruction is delivered daily.  Alternate placement paraprofessionals are provided to students  mandated for Bilingual Instruction who are not in the TBE class, and all ELLs are provided access to native language books,  manipulative, and A-Z Books online to support students in their native language. All ELL students receive adaptive technology  as per their IEP mandates.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All instructional materials used to educate ELLs in our school are age appropriate as they are often modified by our teachers to  meet the cognitive needs of our students.  These materials included but are not limited to school-created curriculum, adapted   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         books, picture books, communication boards, and picture dictionaries, audio and video programs for English language  development and functional based curriculum for transfer of knowledge. In house, ENL and Bilingual teachers work together to  optimize student service needs based on scheduling and student grouping considerations. ELLs and teachers of ELLs  additionally have access to all items purchased using TITLE III funding such as Ipads, computers (laptops and desktops, and  instructional software to support their needs throughout the instructional day.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our main site is a self contained building. We do have 2 off sites at MS 301 (19 self contained classes) and H790 (8 self  contained classes and 3 9:1:2 SETSS Inclusion class). To support our ELLs at these programs, each site is assigned a full time ENL  provider. In both co-located programs, school resources are shared equitably amongst the schools in order to ensure student  needs are being met. Furthermore, we have developed our own resources within each off-site to ensure that all of our  students, have access to all the resources provided by the school.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs may participate in Chapter 683 during the summer session. We additionally focus on connecting ELLs with  community resources and agencies for adults with disabilities in addition to helping them find appropriate program and/or job  placements. These services are immediately offered to all incumbent students to align additional outside agency supports for  students to develop academic and social skills. Newcomer ELLs in the middle and secondary levels additionally are immediately  assessed via Level 1 vocational surveys (both by parents and students) as well as SANDI in order to develop an accurate picture  of student wants, needs and ability levels. These institutions help identify student levels of achievement and align their wants  and needs for their transition out of our program into their instructional experience. Newcomer ELLs additionally have priority  seating within ENL and Bilingual classes to assist in development of their language skills in English and transfer existing skills  from their home language. Newcomer ELLs are additionally supported by ELL department technology including Ipads,  computers, and instructional software to accelerate their acquisition of English language skills. All school support staff  additionally evaluate newcomer ELLs to generate a baseline of student skills and develop student needs (i.e. counseling  services are offered to students and parents, Speech baselines are conducted, PT and OT levels of achievement are identified).  Our Speech and Language department additionally evaluates the communication needs of all newcomer ELLs in order to  identify methodologies and technology to support student language acquisition needs; i.e. dynavox communication systems,  ipads, etc. which are then added to student IEP mandates as necessary.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    As part of District 75, we do not currently offer language electives.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Currently, 188X only features ENL and TBE programs.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72       Two English Language Learning professional development sessions of 150 minutes each will be provided to the all staff  (administrators, secretaries, parent coordinator, teachers, paraprofessionals, and related service providers) working with ELLs ,  during our Election Day Professional Development (November) and Chancellor's Conference Day (June), totaling 300 minutes  (5 hours) per academic year.    Professional Development Program for all staff responsible for delivery and instruction and services to limited English  proficient students-The ELL Compliance person, a member of the LAP Policy team has been designated to attend District 75  professional development on Compliance issues including, program mandates, instructional accountability, and the  administration of NYSESLAT.  The ELL Compliance person then provides professional development bases on the information  obtained to all teachers of ELL students.  The PDs for the ELL teachers help align tasks and curriculum to the Common Core  standards in order to comply with the Common Core Standards and instruction of ELLs. Additionally ESL and Bilingual Teachers  also attend District 75 ELL training.          These outside sources of professional development help our teachers of ELLs to  develop sound practices as they relate to common core instruction for ELL students with disabilities. These trainings include:  Planning Thematic Units for ELLs with Disabilities, Home Language Arts Instructional PD Series: Designing Effective Classroom  Assessments using the Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) for ELLs with Disabilities, Designing Effective Classroom  Assessment for ELLs with Severe Disabilities (suffices as Jose P. Training, Part 2), Supporting Language Acquisition of ELLs with  Disabilities through Visual and Performing Arts, New ELL Teacher PD Series: Designing Effective Classroom Assessments for  ELLs with Severe Disabilities, Co-teaching for ENL teachers and non-ENL/non-bilingual Collaborating and Content-area Teachers  or Related Service Providers (suffices as Jose P.

Training,  Part 1), New ELL Teacher PD Series: Incorporating the Language Experience Approach (LEA) into Instruction for ELLs with  Severe Disabilities. Beyond district trainings, all staff that serve our ENL and Bilingual departments are encouraged to take part  in trainings and workshops offered at the city level by the Department of English Language Learners (DELLs).Teacher of ELLs  additionally conduct professional workshops in-house pertaining to student placement, collaborative inquiry, and sharing of  best practices.In these sessions, the ELL Compliance person facilitates the ELL staff understanding in the changes of mandates  as per CR Part 154, Furthermore, ELL providers engage in planning committees to design common practices to be utilized in  supporting ELL students through stand alone and integrated models of instruction to norm operational practices throughout  the building. ELL teachers also turn-key information and practices from the before-mentioned district level professional  development opportunities as well as plan how outside strategies can be implemented across all classrooms to support ELLs.  These practices help us in ensuring program continuity for our ELLs by coordinating city mandates, aligning school instruction  to educational techniques for ELLs, sharing and turn-keying best practices, and unpacking student data.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In order to meet the 15% staff professional development mandate as per CR Part 154, we have organized the following system.  Counselors assist staff in transitioning ELLs from elementary to middle and middle to high school.  Counselors receive  professional development on ELL transition considerations and recommendations. The transition coordinator arranges  workshops and is available for consultation.    For pedagogical staff, two English Language Learning professional development sessions of 150 minutes each will be provided  to the all staff (administrators, secretaries, parent coordinator, teachers, paraprofessionals, and related service providers)  working with ELLs , during our Election Day Professional Development (November) and Chancellor's Conference Day (June),  totaling 300 minutes (5 hours) per academic year.  Additionally, staff are encouraged to attend District 75 ELL professional  development workshops in order to support ELLs as they engage with the Common Core Learning Standards, especially Jose P  training sessions. The DOE provides professional development workshops to all special education teachers required to have  the minimum 10 hours of Jose P. training.  We expect all new teachers to attend these workshops. A list of teachers having  completed Jose P. training is annually compiled and maintained in the ELL Compliance Binder.  In order to meet the 50% total professional development hours for our ENL and Bilingual Education providers, we conduct  both in-house professional development activities and encourage our providers to attend a minimum of two professional  development workshops at the district level annually. In meeting these hours at the school level, ENL and Bilingual education   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         providers are engaged in several activities on mandated full professional development days as well as meet regularly on a  weekly basis to unpack instructional and best practices as well as compliance information and turn-key professional  development for one another. Additionally, all staff for the ENL and Bilingual program will meet to create specific goals and  assessments for the school curriculum twice per week at the beginning of every instructional unit. Outside sources of  professional development help our teachers of ELLs to develop sound practices as they relate to common core instruction for  ELL students with disabilities. These trainings include: Planning Thematic Units for ELLs with Disabilities, Home Language Arts  Instructional PD Series: Designing Effective Classroom Assessments using the Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) for ELLs  with Disabilities, Designing Effective Classroom Assessment for ELLs with Severe Disabilities (suffices as Jose P.

Training, Part 1), New ELL Teacher PD Series: Incorporating the Language Experience  Approach (LEA) into Instruction for ELLs with Severe Disabilities. Beyond district trainings, all staff that serve our ENL and  Bilingual departments are encouraged to take part in trainings and workshops offered at the city level by the Department of  English Language Learners (DELLs). When staff attend outside PD, they prepare a presentation for teachers of ELLs upon their  return in addition to conducting a workshop on how the material can be applied to our program. Record keeping of  professional development activities will be maintained within the school alongside the ELL Compliance Binder Documents in  the form of agendas and sign-in sheets.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents, including parents of ELLs, actively participate in monthly Parent Teacher Association meetings.  Eleven additional  parent workshops and events take place throughout the year as detailed in the parent/community calendar distributed to all  parents, including the parents of ELLs, in their preferred language, at the start of the school year.  Additionally, the parents of  the students who attend the TITLE III after school program are invited to both orientation for the program as well as events to  highlight student learning and progression. Furthermore, as all students within our school have IEPs, progress in language  development for ELLs is discussed in length at each student’s annual review. During annual review and triennial meetings,  parents are informed of student assessment results pertaining to NYSESLAT, SANDI, NYSAA (when appropriate), and teacher  made formative assessment results which are structured into the present levels of performance section of the IEP for every ELL  student.   Records for these meetings and events are kept and reviewed by the team to measure parent involvement and student  progression within the curriculum. Records are kept in various ways including binders for ELL, TITTLE III, Parent Outreach,  Datafolios / SESIS, etc. as well as curriculum and attendance statistics for invitational and open meetings retained within the  school. The records of attendance, encounters, and use of services are kept by the Parent coordinator in addition to the ELL  Compliance Liaison to track and monitor parent attendance for routine and scheduled school functions. All records of parent  contact and ELL documentation are kept by the ELL Compliance Liaison on record within the school and within student  cumulative folders. Provisions for interpretation and translation of information are as follows: All communication with parents  is provided in English and Spanish by school based staff. All written and verbal communication is offered in service from  coordination of events through the use of the city's interpretation and translation services in both written and oral form to  discuss student needs in languages other than Spanish. We have full time staff members to provide interpretation in the  following languages aside from Spanish; Bengali, French, Russian.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Shanie Johnson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   188X                                                                              School DBN: 75X188  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      An inventory of the Home Language surveys, ATS RPOB report, and Parent-Indicated Preferred Language of  Communication is maintained to ensure that written and oral services are provided in the language requested.  This is also noted on the Student Information Cards, or "Blue Cards". Spanish and Bengali communication are  currently the non-English languages most requested. We have staff members who speak these languages and  communicate with the parents and provide translation of necessary information on a regular basis. For languages  other than Spanish and Bengali, we utilize over-the-phone interpretation services provided by the NYC DOE.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78      Language    Written Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    AFRIKAANS      ARABIC      BENGALI       FRENCH      FULANI      MANDINKA      ENGLISH      PUNJABI       SPANISH      SONINKE      TWI   N/A           0.0   1   4   2   1   4   397   1   104   1   2   N/A   0.0   .19   .77   .39   .19   .77   76.79   .19   20.12   .19   .39   N/A   2   0.0   5   2   1   3   390   1   109   2   2   N/A   .39   0.0   .97   .39   .19   .58   75.44   .19   21.08   .39   .39   N/A   3.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of an emergency, the school has several provisions in place to reach limited English proficient guardians  and families. Primarily, we utilize emergency blue cards at the beginning of each year to identify parents and  guardians as well as family members of LEP families who are able to successfully communicate in English as an  emergency measure if there are no staff members who are capable of interpretation for direct guardians. The main  office additionally has a folder for each non-English and Spanish language, in which in the event of an emergency will  be leveraged by an in-house speaker of the native language in order to call parents in the event of an emergency.  Third, an inventory is kept by the main office of language proficiency for all staff members in order to successfully  delegate family contact to specified individuals in case of an emergency; to which all staff are aware that they may be  needed to contact families. Last, in the case that the above procedures are unavailable due to absenteeism or lack of  third party family members who can interpret for the guardian. the language interpretation unit will be contacted by  the parent coordinator or designated language access coordinator to inform parents of the nature of the emergency.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82         Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff members will be trained by the parent coordinator and language access coordinator on Chancellor's  Regulations A-663 during the designated professional development day in September prior to the commencement of  the school year. Furthermore, all pertinent information related to the LAP and LTI regarding parent contact will be  shared with all school staff members during this initial training. In addition, staff members will be provided with the  DOE welcome poster to display for parents in their classrooms in order for parent or guardian members to indicate  preferred languages at any face to face meetings, and given contact information for the interpretation and translation  unit for use in daily operations.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      P188x follows all protocol in accordance to the Chancellor's Regulation A-663.       • We have posted a large DOE welcome poster which is translated in the common languages covered by the DOE  which indicates who are parent coordinator is and who our Family Advocates are.   • A sign in the common covered languages has been posted in the main lobby near the welcome poster which lets  parents know that translation services are available and for families and guardians to indicate language of preference.   • There are copies on file of the Parents Bill of Rights and the Family Guide in the covered languages in the parent  coordinators office.   • The phone number for Translation services has been distributed to all school personnel (718-752-7373)   • The school will ensure that written communication is translated in the parent’s native language within a reasonable  amount of time.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, the school primarily uses the NYC  School Survey in addition to SLT, PA, and Parent Cooridnator Surveys to gain insight into the the quality of  communication between the staff and the school. In addition to the survey, the school examines the attendance rates  for school functions and IEP meetings to ensure that effective communication takes place for vital processes.

The parent coordinator informally  collects data related to communication and outreach efforts and events and maintains the information to share with  school leaders. The school leadership team monitors the use of language translation and interpretation services by  the office and classroom staff and compiles data to make informed decisions regarding school based policies and  procedures regarding translation and interpretation needs. Using these methodologies the school both formally and  informally monitors our outreach efforts.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84
