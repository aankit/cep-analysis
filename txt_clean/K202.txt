The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.

Our most recent Quality Review in 2018 indicated the following areas within the instructional core that were identified  as proficient:   ● There are assessments that are aligned to the school’s curricula and help to determine student progress across  most  grades  and subjects. Most  teachers consistently use ongoing checks for understanding and student self- assessment during lessons (domain 2.2).  ● Curricula and academic tasks afford diverse learners access to Common Core-aligned content with the necessary      Based on the Quality Review in 2018 & Teacher survey. In order for our school to move to a proficient rating in domain  1.2, we must address the fact that across the vast majority of classrooms there is uneven student engagement across  grades and there are missed opportunities for students to participate in lessons and make their thinking visible. Also,  students grapple with higher order thinking and test level questions during instruction.

According to the 2017-2018 Quality review:      The principal communicates his expectations for teacher performance related to the Danielson Framework for   Teaching through the staff handbook, regular emails, verbal communications, and through posters posted  throughout the building highlighting the instructional focus. He sends out a regular communication entitled,  “The Principal’s Mile Marker,” which emphasizes the school’s instructional focus centered upon engaging  students in small-group instruction with a data-based rationale. Observation feedback helps to remind teachers  about utilizing resources shared at staff meetings, working with a cooperating teacher, and seeking support  from the coach or data specialist to support their efforts. As a result, teachers are held accountable to stated  expectations but also supported to help them achieve expectations (domain 3.4).   Our area of focus as a result of the 2017-2018 Quality Review:     There is uneven student engagement across grades and there are missed opportunities for students to   participate in lessons and make their thinking visible.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Principal in collaboration with DOE liaisons work with the Division of Human Resources to identify qualified literacy  teachers through major recruitment fairs and through relationships with Colleges and Universities. The pupil  personnel secretary works closely with the network HR point person to ensure that non-HQT meet all required  documentation and assessment deadlines. To attract highly qualified candidates to teach at PS 202, we invite them to  visit the school and meet with current staff and administrators. Current staff shares insights about the school and the  positive aspects of working at and continuing to grow professionally at our school. Candidates are informed that  provisions are made for a great deal of differentiated professional development. The prominence of clear  expectations regarding teacher and student performance, as well as opportunities to actively contribute to their own  professional growth and evaluation via the Teacher Performance Review process are other strategies which help us to  attract highly qualified teachers.       2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   To maintain high quality teachers at PS 202, teachers are supported as they enhance their content knowledge and  pedagogical skills. They increase their instructional skills and strengthen their professional practice through ongoing  professional development via faculty conferences, professional learning sessions, network offerings, professional  development days, with the assistance of administrators, coaches and colleagues. Mentors are assigned to support  new and struggling teachers. PS 202 continues to target and plan differentiated high quality professional  development. All professional development is evaluated to determine its effectiveness in promoting high-quality  instruction leading to improved student results. As highly qualified teachers participate in our professional  community, we build capacity and improve in our expertise. Reflection on the impact of instruction helps to ensure  that all students receive instruction by highly qualified teachers.       Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          40      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS202, The Ernest Jenkyns School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 202, The Ernest Jenkyns School will support parents and families of Title I students by:            ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;  ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

This program is an after school program (one program) which will be offered to all  entering and emerging English language learners, twice a week beginning Janurary 29th,  2019.  The sessions will run from 2:30pm to 4:30pm (2 hours) on each day selected.  Each group  will be serviced by a certified ENL/Bilingual teacher and there will be an assigned  paraprofessional.  There will be approximately two groups of students about 6-8 students in each  group. The focus of the program will be literacy to help students meet the state standards as  measured on the NYS ELA exam. There will also be support in all modalities: speaking,  listening, reading and writing, to prepare for the New York State English as a Second Language  Achievement Test (NYSESLAT). The After School program will be offered from Janurary 2019  to the end of March 14th, 2019 (or until funding runs out) for two hours (2:30pm-4:30pm) on  Wednesdays and Thursdays. In addition the ENL teacher will provide push-in/pullout  services  to students during the instructional day for 45 minutes daily. The ENL teacher will maintain all  pertinent records such as attendance, student progress and performance.  The instruction will be in English only and there will be one licensed/certified ENL/Bilingual  teacher and 1 paraprofessional.   Group 1: grades k-2 Group 2:  grades 3-5  Once students have been given pre-assessments once the after school program commences, there  will be a review to verify if groups need to be modified depending on the number of students that  are able to attend. Again, Students with the proficiency levels of entering, emerging and  transitioning ELLs will be invited to participate in the after school program for 2018-19 school  year.  Materials to be used for the After School program:  I. Skill based workbooks aligned with Common Core Learning Standards from Continental Press  such as:  New York ELLs ( NYSESLAT test prep all grades)  Fundations targeting phonics.  Phonics and Word Study/Practice Exercises in Basic English/Finish Line for ELLs - (workbooks  all grades)  II.Texts from Readygen (all grades) and GoMath  specific texts selected by instructors of each group / additional fiction and nonfiction texts for  independent reading selected by instructor(s)  III. Various teacher made worksheets and supplemental materials (all grades)  IV.  Bilingual dictionaries (picture dictionaries available) and glossaries as resources  Once the after school program begins, additional materials will be ordered depending upon  student need.  Based on the initial assessments using the most recent NYSESLAT scores, we will be able to  understand their current level of performance and set interim goals for the school year. In  addition, the classroom teachers have also conducted Fountas & Pinnell running records  assessments to be used to scaffold and differentiate instruction in the classroom. We will be  utilizing the Imagine Learning Program with all of our ENL students to better serve their needs   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   in reading, writing, and phonemic awareness. Students will take an initial assessment during the  2nd week in December. Based on the assessment results they will have an individualized  program that they will engage in throughout the school year as an additional resource in the  classroom. We anticipate that Grades K-5 will be served through our program.

Wilen) and outside specialists such as ELL Coach Instructional Atara Boker and  Tatyana Ulubabova Senior ELL compliance and performance specialist.  The school encourages  all teachers of ELLs (currently 30 teachers - all licensed per DOE regulations), other content area  teachers and paraprofessionals to attend various professional development workshops that will  support those teachers who deliver instruction and services to LEP students. These professional  developments sessions are scheduled at least once a week (sometimes several per week) on  Monday afternoons, during the lunch periods (periods 4 and 5) and/or prep periods.  The teachers  that receive training are in all grades (K to 5) and the training runs a minimum of 45 minutes per  session to a maximum of 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Here are a list of some of the training/PD sessions scheduled for the 2018-19 school year:  Fundations Training and how to support ELLS with phonic instruction/ Ms. Deane- Universal  Literacy Coach  Schoolnet/Stars/ - lead by Ms. Murat and Ms. Zayas  This workshop trains teachers of ELLs to use various sites/online sources to use data for their  ELLs to drive instruction using technology resources.  Data assessment training - lead by Ms. Murat AP and Ms. Deane- Universal Literacy Coach  Assistant   This workshop trains teachers of ELL's to use various data/compilations to drive instruction and  how to implement different sources to better support the literacy skills of ELLs.  Students with Disabilities (including those ELLs who have IEPs) - lead by Vanessa Martinez,  Special Education School Improvement Specialist and Ms. McLawrence Special Needs Liaison  This workshop for teachers of ELLs supports teachers by offering training on explicit teaching  techniques/strategies especially when it comes to vocabulary teaching which is the core building  methods of social language which then supports overall literacy skills of ELLs.  IEP training - lead by Ms.Pac  (IEP specialist) and/or Vanessa Martinez (RSE TASC)   This workshop for teachers of ELLs trains teachers how to write IEPs and what to look for to  differentiate those ELLs who may have been mishandled in terms of the type of support they  may need or require.  Readygen and GoMath training - lead by Ms. Murat and Ms. Pac (data specialist), and Ms. Zayas  (differentiation on ELA/Math lessons for ELLs) - TESOL licensed (K-12) ESL Teacher/ELL  Coordinator   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part C: Professional Development   This training is for teachers of ELLs to further support their lesson planning/writing and  strategies of teaching to ELLs in the classroom using the ELA - Readygen and MATH- Go Math  programs.  Literacy for ELLs/ESL strategies in the classroom - lead by Ms. Zayas (ESL Teacher) This  Training will be on teachers preps in order to be specific with instruction in their classroom.  These workshops are for teachers of ELLs to provide additional support and resources when  differentiating their lessons in the classroom especially for newcomer ELLs and those ELLs who  are struggling with their literacy skills in English.  The trainings model various techniques and  strategies for teachers to use in the classroom for instructional delivery.  All of the workshops that are covered in our PD programs consider the ELL population and how  to better support teachers by reviewing/implementing various ELL teaching  strategies/methodologies, differentiated instruction between language proficiency levels and  assessment tools to enhance planning, goal setting and data copulation. PS 202 understands the  need to support the teachers who have ELLs in general education classes because they need to  foster the learning community to emphasize the improvement of the four modalities of speaking,  listening, reading and writing in language learning. In addition, the ENL teacher attends  professional development outside of the building organized by the Office of ELLs at the DOE,  CFN and other related Implementation departments. The ELL Coordinator turnkeys the  information obtained at the workshops to all general education/content area teachers (specific  teachers dependent on subject) and other staff members based on the information at hand.  This  is all at no cost to Title III funds but benefits those teachers working with the ELLs especially  during the afterschool program since the instruction is explicit with a smaller class environment.          All records for PD, workshops and afterschool programs will be maintained by school officials.  More specifically, my assistant principal,Ms. Murat will maintain all records.    Professional development for teachers will include topics such as: Academic vocabulary and the  ELL population,  ELL Family outreach, assessment, technology and ELL's, ELL Strategies and Best Practices, and  other pertinent topics.  These PD sessions will have a positive impact in the following ways:  1.) It will help us to know our  ELL population both collectively and individually by recognizing  their strengths and weaknesses and identifying the supports that they require.  2.)  Learning about new curriculum, curriculum guides and assessments for all grade levels and  understanding what is expected to be taught and mastered by all ELL's.    3.) Preparing and collecting all data on ELL's and their student progress towards meeting  proficiency. The PD sessions will help us to use data to identify areas of strength and need as  well as come up with a list of professional development topics.  4.) Lastly these PD topics will help us to identify best practices and put systems in place for  student performance and progress.  Using the feedback form PD sessions as well as classroom observations, data and support from  outside agencies, we will provide ongoing support and additional professional learning sessions.

There is a Language Access Coordinator  (LAC) appointed at the school (Ms. Zayas - TESOL licensed/certified K-12) which supports and  ensures that all participating parents/families of ELLs benefit from all workshop/event sessions  and have access to a translator in the home language if there is no english proficiency.  There are  proficient Spanish speakers (volunteer parent/school aide/para professional/teacher)  who are  able to assist the school community with language translations. The dominant home language is  Spanish/Arabic.  We make use of the DOE translation unit and other members of the PS 202  community for Arabic home languages, which are the other languages that are represented at the  school.  This family center allows the parents of ELLs to come in and discuss any concerns and  offers a platform to voice any needs that are lacking at the school for their children. This allows a  true involvement and is an integral part of the connections and open communication that the  school provides for ELL parents. There are several workshops that are offered throughout the  year that deal with various issues to enhance and educate everyone on English Language  Learners (ELLs).  ALL ELLs and parents of ELLs are invited to all workshops, activities and  events that are scheduled.  Parent Involvement is one of the crucial factors for the home-school connection for the school  community. These areas need to be an ongoing focus of support for ELL students.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  For the 2017-18 school year, PS 202 will use the following assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs:  -NYSESLAT/NYSITELL (for newly identified ELLs only)/SPANISH LAB (for HL - SP students only dependent on NYSITELL score)  - DRA (running records)  - TCRWP  (MOSL) reading/writing assessments  - PALS assessments  - Scott Foresman/Avenue Program assessments for ELLs  - Rubicon Curriculum Mapping Assessments for all units  - authentic teacher made formal and informal assessments.    Teachers meet at least twice a week in each grade level meetings and a large part of the reviews are based on various  assessments.  The insights the data provides about the ELLs is how quickly the beginner ELLs are either improving are areas in  which there needs to be more attention and support based on various learning styles.  If a particular assessment tool is not   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          55      working well with certain ELLs depending on their proficiency level and months/years of service, the lessons can be adjusted or  an alternative authentic assessment can be implemented with the assistance of the ELL Coordinator.  All of the ELLs in grades K-2  have had 1 or 0 years of service.  35% are at an A reading level (based on TCRWP) and the other  65% are unable to read/write.  Over 90% of these students have no literacy in their home language.  The 65% are not  proficient with letter recognition/letter sounds so we are working to see what additional literacy supports will best benefit the  ELLs based on the data thus far.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   N/A     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  PS 202 uses a variety of both formal and informal assessments to measure the success of the ELL program.  Each ELL is profiled  not only by the ENL teacher but is monitored by the classroom teacher with student portfolios and there is a holistic review  throughout the school year.  Student results are reviewed and monitored.  The administration reviews teacher and parent  feedback regarding ELL programs at the school as well.  Data is reviewed to track the performance of ELLs.  The following assessments/tools are used:  - NYSESLAT/NYSITELL (GR K-5)  - ELL Periodic Assessments (Fall/Spring) (GR 3, 4 and 5)  - Interim Assessments (GR 3,4 and 5)  - MOSL assessments - reading/writing content areas (GR K-5)  - DRA (running records) (GR K-5)  -Rubicon Curriculum Mapping Assessments (GR K-5)  - PALS assessments (GR K-2)   - authentic teacher assessments, observations, student portfolios (GR K -5)        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    N/A     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school is in the process of reworking the RTI model and will plan to implement an instructional framework for using data  to  drive instruction for ELLs using this framework.  Many members of the CEP/LAP team will be planning within the RTI  framework once it is officially adapted.  In the meantime, members of the PPT team are working closely with teachers to  impose RTI strategies for ELLs in the classrooms and PDs will be offered to those teachers of ELLs to develop intervention plans  within the classroom.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Grade K - Reading/Writing needs improvement on the whole (100% are newcomers).  There is a priority to build their social  language and have them become more communicatively competent within the classroom and learning environments when at  school.  Grades (1-2) - Reading/Writing needs a lot of support since 41% of these ELLs has a C or lower.  The other 59% have an A level  or are unable to read in write in English or their home language.   Speaking/Listening skills also need to be developed for about  90% of the students (92% are newcomers).   Grades (3-4) - 24%  have just arrived to the US from another country since this school year has commenced or have been living  in the US 1 year or less.  There is a need to build proficiency in all modalities based on the data patterns especially since 67% or  more of the students are more than one or two grades (or more) below reading/writing level not only in English but in their  native languages.     2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          56         Grades (5) - There needs to be a focus on the reading/writing modalities.  Although there are a couple newcomers, the  majority of these ELLs are below grade level by more than 1, 2 or 3 years (85% minimum)      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Monthly ELL meetings to monitor enrollment and pedagogical practices.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ELL program at PS 202 focus on the following for all ELLs:    •     academic rigor; high expectation and goal setting  •     the use of ENL methodologies during instruction within the common core curriculum   •     alignment of all instruction with the NYS Common Core and ESL standards  •     the recruitment and retention of high quality teachers of English Language Learners (based on funding).            -PS 202 has a Freestsanding heterogeneous ENL program that provides all english language arts and content  subject core matter instruction in English through the use of specific instructional strategies.  Students are pulled out  and travel to another classroom (RM 213) to receive ENL instruction which is provided by a TESOL certified/licensed  teacher (S.Oh) for those students who are at an Entering, Emerging and Transitioning proficiency level.  These  students also receive integrated ENL instruction in their classroom when the ENL pushes in.  The Expanding and  Commanding proficiency level ELLs receive integrated ENL instruction in their classroom as the ENL teacher co- teaches with the classroom teacher.  Support is also provided in the students’ native language by pairing students of  the same language group if necessary for newcomers only. There is 1 certified/licensed ENL teacher (S. Oh) that  serves the ENL student population.  She facilitates student comprehension and linguistic summary  (pragmatically/semantically) where needed to ELLs as part of the language program instructional support by  consulting with classroom teachers, grade leaders and administration.  Out of the 53 current ELLs, 79% are  newcomers and 48% of the newcomers have been residing in the United States or registered in a US school system  about 1 year or less.           - All ELL students receive standalone and/or integrated services as an ENL delivery model and receive instruction  as required by NYSED, CR Part 154 Regulations.  Instruction is provided in content specific, heterogeneous grouping  for all pull out/push in ENL classes for grades Kindergarten to Grade 5.   - Students are grouped not only by proficiency (SPK/LST modalities) but also by literacy levels.  Students are blended  by grades as well:  There are 8 main ENL groups:  1.(GR K-2)  2.(GR K-2)  3.(GR 2-4)  4.(GR 3)  5.(GR 3-5)  6.(GR 5)  7.(GR 4-5)      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          57         The number of students in each group may shift depending on new admits, transfers, student needs, progress and  unit/topic.  Most groups are heterogeneous except for the students who have just arrived from another country  within the past few months and have no reading/writing skills in English or in their home language.  Some immediate  newcomer groups will change as the year continues because some may develop/progress stronger literacy levels  whereas others will require more support since there was no literacy skills in their native language to transfer skills.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A at present      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Students receive mandated instruction (90, 180 or 360 minutes dependent on their tested proficiency level based on the  NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT results ) and are scheduled for ENL instruction as required by NYSED, CR Part 154  Regulations.  Instruction is provided in content specific, heterogeneous grouping for all standalone and or/ integrated ENL  services for grades Kindergarten to grade 5. Once all of the ELL students are identified, the ELL Coordinator works with the  principal to schedule the ENL program for all ELL students in grades K to 5.  All of the teacher/student schedules are compared  to ensure that students are serviced with ENL support time during the appropriate periods.  Students are not to be pulled  during content area subjects (other than ELA) or any other mandated subjects that they are required to be in the self- contained class.  The staff ensures that all ELL students are serviced per their proficiency level requirements as  supported/authorized by the administration.  A copy of each student's ELL service eligibility and proficiency levels are given to  all classroom teachers in writing and special services staff.  All school administrators are supplied copies of ELL schedules,  statistics and data throughout the school year.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the Freestanding ENL program, an instruction is provided 100% in English.  The teacher will ask more advanced students  within a group to assist with minor translations of certain words/concepts when necessary depending on a lesson.  Although  the school has selected READYGEN as the literacy program, the differentiated instruction for ELLs have been considered for  higher proficiency students.  Since 90% of the ELLs this school year are newcomers with most at an Entering or Emerging  proficiency level, a newcomer ENL curriculum has been designed.  As for the other remaining ELLs, the ENL teacher works with  the grade curriculum maps, classroom, and grade leader teachers and differentiates for those ELLs.  Cooperative learning  strategies are utilized in addition to scaffolding, graphic organizers, information gap activities, interview grid, strip story, role  playing, think-pair-share, making connections, buddy read, choral read, questioning, predicting, making inferences, listening,  brainstorming, and various other strategies are used to make content comprehensible and to enrich language development.  The teacher utilizes a variety of instructional materials to support our ELLs with a focus on explicit teaching.  Content is mainly  delivered using the TPR (Total Physical Response) method for new arrivals and Community Language Learning Approach.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Our ENL program delivers instruction in English only. The ELLs at PS 202 currently are not evaluated in their home language  throughout the year. The school currently does not have any native language classes and does not have an evaluation process  in place since we do not have any TBE or Dual language classes.  The only evaluation in place is the SPANISH LAB to evaluate  native language (for those spanish speaking students only) after NYSITELL exams have been administered for those students  who are eligible for SPANISH LAB.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          58      c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Plan for SIFE:  The ELL Coordinator (A. Zayas) ensures that all SIFE students are identified in the school.  The classroom teacher is also  providing one on one time for these students.  Extra service time is provided to those SIFE students depending on which  content areas need attention and more support.  As we receive more SIFE students in the future, we will continue to support  their needs with extra services.  Some examples may include a bilingual placement (based on parent choice/approval) with  additional pull-out using ENL strategies, AIS services and/or after school tutoring and programs (when available based on  funding).  Special Education services are also available for those students who may need to be referred for evaluation to verify  if any learning disabilities may exist.  We also have a Pupil Personnel Team (PPT) that teachers can refer students to for  evaluation and progress.   The SIFE students currently enrolled at PS 202  are assessed and monitored throughout the year  since they are in need of extra support. SIFE students are  provided with instructional support specifically designed to meet  their particular instructional needs, in the development of literacy skills and knowledge in academic content areas as detailed  above.  Not every SIFE student is the same and each has his/her specific needs based upon their histories so it is of utmost  importance that all educators are aware of the needs.  We request parents to engage and participate in their child's learning.  b. Plan for ELLs in school less than 3 years/ Newcomers:  Based on the results of their NYSITELL/NYSESLAT assessments, newcomers to the English language school system will receive  their required ENL services.  Small group or individual instruction will focus on their immediate needs to facilitate a smooth  transition.  In addition, classroom teachers will provide support to the newcomers by placing them in groups with native  English language speakers as well as students who share the same first language as the newcomers (when available).  Students  will participate in small group, task-oriented situations that guide the production of language both in verbal and written  form.  Students’ seating arrangements will enable them to clearly see and hear the teacher during instruction.     Newcomers to the country are immediately serviced with some one-on-one ENL time during the first month of the program  (as available) which they are made to feel more comfortable in their new setting by developing some "survival" language to  begin their communicative competence fluency after they are assessed via the NYSITELL exam (within 10 days of registration),  SPANISH LAB (if applicable) and other diagnostic materials to determine their English Language Proficiency (ELP).  The ENL  teacher also provides integrated/ push-in services to the general education classroom per regulation, in order to make the  transition as smooth as possible for the student (based on need).  c. Plan for ELLs in school 4-6 years :  The ELLs who are receiving service for 4-6 years are offered various support services such as RTI/AIS services in addition to the  ELL support services based on proficiency.  The school's literacy teacher (J. D'Ambra) with the assistance of the ENL teacher  offers teachers various teaching strategies to differentiate to their ELLs.  Also, the elected READYGEN literacy program caters  to this group of ELLs as they have designed differented planning for ELLs in this program which is geared for more advanced  proficiency ELLs.  Parents are asked to really get involved and work with the students at home with their literacy support and  language support.  They are closely observed and the goals that are set for them are examined monthly.  The push is to  concentrate on the modalities that they are having trouble testing proficient on the NYSESLAT.  There is close examination of  what progress of the 4-6 year ELLs so that they do not fall into the Long-Term ELL pattern.  There are professional  developments (PD) and various workshops that are offered to the self-contained classroom teachers with ELLs so they are able  to continue to support the needs of these ELLs in all of the content areas.  All grade inquiry teams work closely together as ELL  students move from grade to grade.  There is extreme effort to ensure that all the long term and short term individual  students goals are documented and followed closely so that the students are monitored in their “trouble” areas.     Both the classroom teacher and the ESL teacher use modeling, scaffolding and realia techniques.  With these approaches the  students will develop interpersonal communication skills (the connection between form and structure for English and their  social-functional meaning), develop the ability to use language by actively employing the students’ information processing  capabilities required to acquire academic language skills that underline reading comprehension and other content areas, and  use language for a functional purpose so that language acquisition emerges as a result of the need to communicate while  performing academic activities (the subject matter may be modified so that it is comprehensible to the ELL students).  There is  a focus on explicit teaching.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          59         d. Plan for ELLs in school 6 years completed or more / Long Term ELLs:  Long term ELLs will continue to receive their required ENL services plus additional support that will be provided through a  Personal Intervention Program and/or additional support with academic services (RTI/AIS services) .  There is a review of the  Long-Term ELLs progress and target the skills that are keeping the student from testing out on the NYSESLAT.  Besides  additional academic intervention services that are offered, there is counseling and various meetings with the student to  discuss not only short term and long term goals, but to target the modalities that need the most support.  These ELLs are also  offered afterschool programs for additional support and Saturday academy classes (based on funding).  There is support of  reflection and peer work that will strengthen the student’s confidence so that the most important goal of testing proficient on  the NYSESLAT is evident.  The progress is documented and various ENL strategies are investigated to seek the best teaching  methods for these students.  There are also PD and various workshops to support the general education classroom teachers so  that they too can participate in the specific ELL needs of the students in a meaningful way.  The parents are encouraged to be  involved to work together with the teachers to foster language learning so the goal of testing proficient can be met on the  upcoming NYSESLAT.  e. Plan for Former ELLs:  The school adheres to all testing accommodations for Former ELLs.  They also receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services for  up to 2 years or more.  The ELL Coordinator advises all teachers of former in ELLs in writing of their status and works with them  throughout the year to verify if there are any issues and need for additional ENL service time (based on availability).  The ENL teacher schedules the former ELL in appropriate groups in their main classroom for additional services when  necessary and placement depends on need within the exisiting ENL groups.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Some instructional strategies that teachers of ELLs implement is the TPR method, Community Language Learning approach and  fostering of a collaborative small group learning environment.  The teachers use various technological programs such as  Waterford and Myon reading/writing programs to support and build literacy.  There is use of smartboards, Promethean boards  and various english language learning websites to aid instruction.  There is use of bilingual glossaries, dictionaries and native  language books in the classroom libraries (ENL) to build comprehension and provide access to academic content areas and  accelerate English language development.  Some grade-level materials used are the Scott Foresman ESL texts as well as the  Avenues text by Hampton Brown along with numerous fiction/non-fiction texts. This is outside of the ELA - READYGEN  program texts.  Various graphic charts/organizers, flash cards, periodicals, posters, manipulatives, games etc. are implemented  to differentiate and vary instruction and lessons.  The ENL, SETSS (R. McLawrence) and SPEECH (K.Jean) teachers work closely  together for those ELLs with special needs based upon their IEPs.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school will do all possible to use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of all ELL- SWDs.  The school culture enables grade team leaders, inquiry team leaders and administration to meet frequently to discuss  the special needs of all students.  The ENLteacher also works together with classroom/cluster teachers frequently to discuss  various needs of particular student(s) so that the necessary changes can be made in scheduling or instructional matters.  The  ELL Coordinator is invited to join any of the teams that are in place at the school.  The focus is to be as flexible with the needs  of all ELLs within the least restrictive learning environment.  We have a parent coordinator (R. Julian) and guidance counselor  (S. Smith) available for those students who may need additional counseling or other needs.  There is also a PPT team on hand  to aid those referred students who are in need of immediate academic interventions.  The ELL Coordinator works closely with  the IEP team, especially the school psychologist (C. Cylin) and family assistant(Z. Cabrera).         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Intervention Programs for ELLs (RTI, AIS, PPT) - offered based on need/ individual student basis (based on funding)  Targeted Academic Intervention Services are provided to students during the school day (as scheduling permits as well as   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          60      need) and during after school, before school and Saturday programs (as funding permits).  ELLs are offered academic  intervention services mostly in ELA and math subjects in small group tutorial sessions during the school day or after school  (funding to be determined for this school year's after school programs). In addition, ELLs are invited to participate in all  scheduled academic enrichment programs.  The programs are designed to further support ELL development as well as content  area instruction/review.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There has been a large investment in technology at our school and the ENL dept has been provided with a Promethean board  as well as most classrooms.  We have already implemented Waterford and Myon reading/writing programs and the following  will be considered:  Reading from A to Z.  (for newcomers and struggling readers)  Girls and Boys Club  Better grouping for After/Morning School ENL program (based on funding)  Saturday Academy         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Currently, there are no specific programs/services that are being discontinued.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ALL eligible ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  There are ELL funds set aside to assist those ELLs who may  have financial difficulties to participate in a particular program so that they can experience all that the school may have  planned.  Every year there is one or more of the following scheduled usually by the month of DEC for ELLs (instruction by  licensed ELL teacher and 1 or more content area teacher based upon the number of students) :     ENL After school program (usually offered for 2 hours or more twice a week or more - as funding permits)  ENL Morning program (usually offered for 1 hour at least 4 times per week - as funding permits)  ENL Saturday program (usually offered for 3 hours or more - as funding permits     All ELL students are provided with the opportunity to participate in all school activities (when scheduled/offered) and are not  excluded in any way.  The school does not discriminate and all ELLs are welcome and encouraged to participate in all programs  and events offered at the school.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs such as academic, dances, school  shows, events, workshops, fairs etc.   Parents are given access to information where ELLs are able to participate in community  based organizations such as the PAL program, DFOY, CYPRESS and other independent after school programs such as More For  You.  ELLs are afforded the same eligibility to participate in after school programs as any other student.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials including technology/ Instructional materials in Content Areas:  PS 202 utilizes instructional materials that include both text and technology. Students use a variety of materials to support  teaching and learning in themes and content specific activities. Various on-line sites developed for the support of ENL students  are also used to bolster student ability and use of technology.       Besides the READYGEN/GO MATH programs we supplement with the use of Scott Foresman ELL materials with both hardcover  and workbook for newcomers to advanced proficiency levels grades K-5.  We also use The Avenues program for grades K- 5.  These programs greatly consider newcomer ELLs which is the largest population at our school.  There are various/numerous  books, educational magazines and games that are geared to support ELLs with their second language acquisition.  There are  also authentic materials that are used which vary from all proficiency levels and grade bands.  All ENL students (K- 5) are  provided additional  technology time every week and they work in pairs (when not in technology class and in the ENL  room).  Technology is also used to support all ELLs.  Besides computers, the ENL program uses the Promethean/Smart boards,  DVD player and cd player to incorporate various lessons and exercises that foster proficiency in the listening and speaking   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          61      modalities.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided by the knowledge of more advanced proficiency students if necessary during a particular  ENL lesson.  There is a bilingual library available (currently in the spanish language) in the ENL classroom, bilingual glossaries  and bilingual dictionaries available for students to use whenever necessary.  There has been an increase of Arabic speakers in  the past couple of years so bilingual Arabic books will be added to the library.  We currently offer Arabic-English dictionaries  and glossaries besides what can be accessed on-line.  ELLs are encouraged to maintain their home language and it is not  discouraged in classes.  Students are encouraged to continue expanding their literacy in their home language while they are  continuing their second language acquisition.  This information is shared with parents at parent-teacher conferences, parent  orientation and workshops.  The parents are advised that maintaining the home language is an asset and big support of second  language acquisition.  All of our services support, and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELL students have the support of their teachers, administration, the parent coordinator (R. Hawkins-Julian), the guidance  counselor (S. Smith) and all staff members.  The guidance counselor assist students with middle school requirements. The  parent coordinator works closely with parents to facilitate a positive home school relationship for all students including ELLs.  Information, both written and oral, is provided to parents in their native language to ensure effective communication and  parent involvement whenever possible.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials including technology/ Instructional materials in Content Areas:  PS 202 utilizes instructional materials that include both text and technology. Students use a variety of materials to support  teaching and learning in themes and content specific activities. Various on-line sites developed for the support of ENL students  are also used to bolster student ability and use of technology.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62         At this point in time, there is no specific program in place to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the  school year other than a school rep. providing a tour of the school requested and a licensed pedagogue assisting with the  registration process and forms, especially the HLIS form/interviews.   The administration usually holds an open house in the  month of August which all ELL parents/students are welcome to attend that offer assistance.  All ELLs are invited to participate  in any school activity such as dances, trips, clubs (karate, biking, basketball etc.).        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently, there are no language electives offered to ELLs or any other student at PS 202 but that may change in the near  future.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development are planned throughout the school year.  There are at least 5 sessions planned for teachers of ELLs  each month. The administration also enables the ELL Coordinator to attend ELL related PDs throughout the year offered by the  DOE affiliated branch, Office of ELLs or NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual/Education-Resource Network(RBE-RN .   PD plan for teachers and staff working with ELLS (other than the ENL Teacher):  The ELL Coordinator (S.Oh - TESOL certified) will support staff needs including: professional development, best approach  methodology, ENL prototype, data analysis, comprehensive needs assessment, parental involvement, compliance and  instructional issues, preparation for the NYSESLAT and program design.   The ELL Coordinator also receives support from DOE affiliated offices (Office of ELLs-SWDs) throughout the year on how to  assist teachers of ELLs to better support them to differentiate to ELLs in accordance to the common core curriculum.  Staff  development will include training for all teachers using ENL methodologies.  Many classes have at least one or more current or  former ELL student(s) and teachers must be trained in the strategies that can be incorporated into the READYGEN and GO  MATH programs that will enhance English language acquisition.      A collaborative approach will be part of the training where teachers will focus on instructional approaches that will articulate  into long-range teaching strategies.  Teachers will also be attuned to the variables that affect language learning and  instruction:  age, grade, placement, personality, educational background, level of proficiency in both the native language and  English, parental support, needs of the student and resources available to the teachers.     Demonstrations and modeling will be the focus of much of the instructional presentation. These include providing many  nonverbal clues such as pictures, objects, demonstrations, gestures, and intonation cues. As competency develops, other  strategies include building from language that is already understood, using graphic organizers (including, Four Square for  writing, Venn diagram, T-chart etc.), hands-on learning opportunities, and cooperative or peer tutoring techniques.  Language  components will be stressed.  Vocabulary study (which is excellent for all students) will be a pivotal piece and ELL students will  work with a buddy when necessary.  Staff development will also focus on alternate assessments, stressing assessments that  are not totally writing-dependent and specific strategies which have been successful with ELLs. Strategies for including culture  is another main theme at the PDs. Incorporating culture into the classroom should be about more than holidays and food.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63         There are many strategies that teachers can use to encourage an awareness of student diversity.      PS 202 provides support to staff to assist with ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school with various  orientations, counseling, events where middle school reps come into the school for speaking engagements as well as a yearly  career fair (chaired by S. Smith).  There is inquiry team and SLT team involvement so that students can transition smoothly and  know the academic expectations and challenges of the next grade.     Training of all staff – 7.5 Hours required/ records  Teachers presently working at PS 202 are long time staff members and are familiar with the 7.5 hours of ELL training for all  staff.  For those teachers that must fulfill the training requirement, training will be provided on site by the ELL Coordinator and  administration. The training will be facilitated to staff in the Fall and the Spring at a minimum. Each participant usually is  awarded a certificate of completion upon completion of the training series.    Evidence of these trainings will be filed and  secured (attendance/agenda planned).       The principal is in high support of professional development for the ENL teacher and permits attendance/participation at least  once a month or more based upon scheduled events.  There is also participation/feedback required during grade leader  meetings and common core planning.  The school concentrates on fostering PDs to the ENL teacher especially to turn-key  strategies and information that is acquired outside of the building.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ELL Coordinator works closely with the guidance counselor who handles all transition needs from elementary to middle  school grades.  There are meetings that are scheduled specifically for ELL students and parents who may require information in  their home language.  The ELL Coordinator schedules a translator to be in attendance at these meetings with parents and/or  with student.     The ELL Coordinator plans/schedules PDs throughout the year to meet the minimum 15% of total hours for all teachers for ELL  related professional developments.  The principal ensures that the ENL teacher receives ELL -specific professional  developments by authorizing attendance to meet the 50% of total hours necessary for ENL teachers to receive support at  these ELL-specific PDs.  The principal advises the ENL teacher about workshops/events that are offered throughout the year.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ELL Parents are provided and offered annual individual meetings throughout the year especially during open school night every  Tuesday of each week.  Of course ELL parents can schedule these meetings outside of this time.  There are translations  available for high frequency languages such as Spanish and Arabic specific to our school but we also make use of the DOE  translation unit for interpretation/translation needs.     Parents/guardians choose the program that will best meet their children’s needs.  When entitlement is verified,  parents/guardians of newly enrolled ELLs are informed and encouraged to participate in a parent orientation workshop.  At the  meeting , information is given on the programs available, state standards, assessments and expectations for their children.  Students are placed in the program selected by the parent/guardian.  Certain activities are initiated and planned to address the  needs of parents which are ongoingly evaluated throughout the school year.  Parents are reminded that the DOE offers a  website that has useful information for all types of parental needs and is translated in many languages.  Parents are  encouraged to attend DOE sponsored parent events/orientations/workshops.  Parents are provided copies of flyers in both   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64            english and native languages regarding these events throughout the year.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Exclusive parent trips and cultural exchange programs are scheduled each year.  Cooking, technology, academic, cultural and  other informational workshops/programs are scheduled each month.  There is an events calendar that is planned by the PTA  and parent coordinator regarding all of the activities and on-goings at the school.  There is also invitations of parent volunterr  opportunities.       ELL parents are always invited to be involved with various activities at our school. All parents are invited to PTA meetings and  open school night functions.  Many of the parents are invited to join in for READ ALOUDS program in classes, WALK IN OUR  FOOTSTEPS program and observations not only with the ENL teacher but with all the teachers at the school. We encourage  parent volunteers in all areas of the school.   Parents are involved with various bake sales, flower sales, escorting students on  field trips and classroom activities to name a few.  There are many teachers who are proficient in Spanish which is 83% of the  dominant home language for the ELLs at our school.  We also have a few PTA parent volunteers who are proficient in both  English and Spanish.  We offer parents translation services for a language that is not immediately offered by a professional at  the school by arranging the necessary trained translation specialist based on need or with the assistance of the DOE translation  dept.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ronald James, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Ernest S.
