This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At MS 358, we believe that students learn best when they are able to apply their learning to real-life situations and  problems. When students have opportunities to access learning (content) and transfer that knowledge to the  appropriate setting (context) it is evident that new learning has taken place. We believe that this new learning that  students experience is best communicated in the following ways through our 3P learning philosophy, “ Passionate  speaking, Purposeful writing, and Powerful presentations.”   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      MS 358’s instructional focus for 2018-2019 is, “If teachers design lessons and deliver instruction that incorporates  “Purposeful writing” activities and opportunities for “Passionate speaking” then students will be able to make their  thinking and reasoning visible through writing, speaking and other work products. Our mission is to ensure that  students graduate on or above grade level, having mastered essential learning standards as identified by the school  and that they use core values to lead successful, meaningful lives.   When students are able to articulate new learning, to convey their thinking, through passionate speaking, it is evident  that they grasp key concepts and content. Using language appropriately, applying content in the correct context and  demonstrating the use of technical vocabulary in specific disciplines are key indicators of academic success.   At MS 358 we believe in engaging students in purposeful writing as an effective strategy through which students can  write to learn. When students develop their ideas, apply critical thinking to express new learning through writing skills  and incorporating writing to learn enables students to experiment every day with written language and increase their  fluency and mastery of written conventions.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Middle School 358 is located in district 28 at 88-08 164th Street in Jamaica, New York. For the 2017-2018 school-year  a portion of seats were zoned and the remaining seats were unscreened. All seats were occupied by former 5th grade  students throughout district 28. Prior to designing the school, the principal analyzed district trends in English  Language Arts (ELA) and Math scores for 5th grade students. The district was divided into three sections, the north,  central, and south. Looking at the 5th grade ELA scores from each geographic section of the district formed the  school’s theory of action. The average 5th grade ELA score in the north was 2.89, in the central section it was 2.67 and  in the south it was 2.00. Since all students in the district applied to M.S. 358 literacy is an important part of the  instructional program at MS 358.   Our key area of focus is literacy, promoting students to have high quality discussions and integrating art through core  subject areas. Collaborative Teachers during the 2017-2018 school year was an element from the Framework for  Great Schools that was a strength. Teachers participated in inter-visitations, inquiry work, and led committees to  support one another and building teacher capacity.   At MS 358, we believe in supporting student learning through rigorous instruction that incorporates passionate  speaking, purposeful writing, powerful presentations, and digital literacy through STEAM. We believe in providing a  safe, nurturing environment that supports growth in which all students take intellectual risks, think critically and work  collaboratively to solve real world problems or conduct research. As future leaders of the 21st century, our students  will purposefully engage the local community, parents, and stakeholders as they progress on the continuum of college  and career readiness and beyond.   Partnerships that will support the mission and theory of action, are as follows:   Queens Library Merrick branch- This partnership will support literacy and parent-student partnership through  reading. All students at M.S. 358 will receive a library card from the Queens Library during the first month of the  school year.   AR Reader- This partnership will support literacy and increasing student’s lexile levels by offering students the  opportunity to read and assess themselves on books that they choose to read based on their current reading levels.   Materials for the Arts- This partnership will support the integration of Art in core subjects and support Science,  Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math instruction.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Middle School Quality Initiative- Chancellor's initiative that supports literacy and building capacity of schools and  inter-visitations between schools. Students will also participate with MSQI science fairs and MSQI debates to promote  high quality discussions.   Harmony Program- This partnership supports music instruction for students and supports Art being a focus at MS358.   Debate Team – Students participate in the Queens Borough Field Center’s debate league in which they use evidence  to support or refute a topic. This program supports high quality discussions and is aligned with the school’s mission  and instructional focus.   CHAMPS - An initiative of the New York City Department of Education that promotes physical activity among children  going through the critical years of middle school.    CUNY Tutor Corps in Math and Computer Science - The CUNY Tutor Corps in Math and Computer Science brings  students from CUNY colleges into classrooms, helping them become highly effective tutors and teaching assistants in  the mathematics and computer science classrooms while supporting and engaging students in learning through group  and one-on-one tutoring sessions.   Blue Engine Teaching Apprentice – A program that brings together teams of teachers to re-imagine the classroom  experience for all students, resulting in dramatic gains in academic achievement and diverse groups of apprentice  teachers prepared for success in the classroom. Blue Engine Teaching Assistants (BETAs) work alongside teachers for a  school year to support teaching a more rigorous academic curriculum that equips students with the college ready  skills in mathematics, literacy, and social cognition.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   There are 130 entering 6th grade students, and 135 7th grade students and 125 8th grade students for September  2018. 74 students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and 95 students are English Native Speakers (ELLs).  Based on the average percentage of ELLs and Students with Disabilities (SWDs) in district 28, 10.9% and 15.3%  respectively, M.S. 358 will have a higher ELL and SWD population.   Based on the needs of the district, evidenced by the range of 5th Grade ELA Proficiency from 2.00-2.89, and based on  a projected population of ELLs and SWDs above the district average, a literacy focus for MS 358 will support all  learners. These sources of data informed the theory of action for the school, “purposeful writing and passionate  speaking.”         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As we enter our fourth year and grow additionally with new students and staff, our goal is to continuously be  committed to the success and improvement of our classrooms and school. By supporting students, teachers and staff  through visible leadership and establishing a positive school culture, this year, we made the most progress in the  areas of Collaborative Teachers and Effective School Leadership. We will continue to nurture professional growth of  teachers and staff offering relevant and applicable cycles of learning and offering feedback that drives student  achievement.    Our key areas of focus for this school year will be to further develop our family-community ties by working with  families and offering them expanded community resources. Our goal is to establish partnerships with 1-2 additional  organizations such as the local YMCA, and encourage connections with our families to support their needs. We will  also continue to strive to make progress in the area of student trust, working with organizations that will help  teachers through professional learning, with strategies that foster positive relationships.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 28Q358   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   381   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The strategies that will be used to support having Highly Qualified Teachers with recruitment will be to identify those  teachers who are multiply certified and list it as a requirement on the job posting. This approach was taken year 1 to  have highly qualified teachers who are certified in SWDs and content areas.   Teacher retentions will support teachers growing on the school level and with their career goals. Each teacher will  have a personal professional learning plan and will earn responsibility by demonstrating ability and capacity to lead  teams.    Teacher assignments will leverage teachers to use their areas of strength to support student achievement. Teachers  with demonstrated success with high needs students will be positioned to support achievement with those  assignments. Teachers will be paired with mentors and collaborative teachers based on their areas of strength and  areas of growth. Teacher assignments will build teacher capacity, independence, and shared practices.           2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).      Professional learning activities will be of high quality and will be incorporated in teacher schedules on a weekly basis.  There will be opportunities for teachers to lead areas of Professional learning where they have strengths. Partnerships  with York College, Urban Advantage, Buck Institute, Blue Engine,Teacher’s College, Showcase Schools, Accelerated  Reader, MSQI, and izone’s Blended Learning Institute will support teachers with high quality professional learning  opportunities.    Using research from Dr. Drago-Severson, Teachers College, professional learning opportunities will follow the four  pillars for adult learning, Teaming, Mentoring, Collegial Inquiry and Providing Leadership roles. There will be ongoing  opportunities for all staff members to engage in authentic professional learning.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      These strategies for professional learning will be aligned with the QR rubrics Well Developed expectations, the  Danielson Framework for teaching and M.S. 358’s mission goals.    Common planning time and intervisitation are two professional learning activities that will ensure that content and  curricula are aligned to Next Generation Learning Standards and the M.S. 358’s mission goals.

Partnering with Assessment Matters also will support us with tracking  mastery of Next Generation Learning Standards and promoting students to have a growth mindset. 6. The Middle  School Quality Initiative will also support professional learning that is aligned to our instructional focus, "purposeful  writing and passionate speaking."   Decisions will be made by the principal with the School Quality Committee serving as an advisory board to analyze  multiple metrics previously listed to support the frequency and quality of assessment measures issued. The  Professional learning committee will lead the professional learning in the building and collaborate with city-wide  initiatives for job-embedded learning through Showcase School visits, MSQI visits, and Assessment Matters  intervisitation. Professional learning in the building will be supported through teachers turn-keying information and  using each other as “masters of learning” in specific areas to enhance teaching and learning practices.           4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  5a, 5B,5C,5D,5E              5a, 5B,5C,5D,5E      Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   $ 192,576              $2,949,047      X              X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. M.S. 358 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   M.S. 358 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

We provided service for 10 former ELLS in 7th grade and 3 former ELLS in 6th grade.  We are  expecting about 30 new ELLS students to enter the 6th grade, which will bring the total number  of students we are servicing to about 90 students. We will know the exact numbers of students  who tested out after taking the 2017 NYSESLAT in August of 2017. After we have this data we  will know how many former and current ELLs we will service. Availability of Title III money  will allow us to supplement the service we provide for our ELL population to ensure they are  college ready and are making progress towards their second language acquisition. Programs will  include after school homework support for ELLS in Math and ELA  and specific use of  technology to complete projects, many of our ELL students do not have access to technology at  home. Saturday Program starting in February 2018 to support with test sophistication.  On October 2017 we will begin to offer after school academic support to all ELL students. We  would like to offer a.m small group instruction for our Advanced ELL students from 7:45-8:15  a.m on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays which willl focus on the modalities we have  assessed they need support with. after reviewing the 2017 NYSESLAT score breakdown. In  addition we wan to offer after school support 2-3 days a week from 2:45-4:00 ( Specific dates  TBD by ENL Dept). The ENL Department is made up 4 certified ENL teachers, one teacher is  certified in Spanish and ENL, another teacher is has S.S supplementary certification and ENL  and our one of our Math teachers is also dually certified in ENL and Math, two teachers are only  certified in ENL K-12.    The Saturday program will support ELL students with specific strategies and essential skills that  they need to succeed in ELA and Math. As a school we have have identified 6 essential skills  that students need to be successful  in both ELA and Math and we will focus on addressing these  skills in Saturday Program.    The reason we are focusing on ELA and Math supplemental supports for Title III is based on the  results of the RASP report for this academic year.According the RASP  for 2016-2017 of our  current 16 students who took the ELA exam 2/7 ELL & SWD students did not meet the criteria  for ELA and 5/9 ELL students did not meet the criteria. This shows of all ELL students who took  the 2017 ELA exam  9/16 met the criteria. Of 16 ELL students who took the 2017 Math exam  4/7 ELL & SWD  and 2/9 ELL students did not meet the criteria for the Math exam. This  shows  that 10/16 met the criteria in Math.    According to the RASP for 6th grade of our 27 students who took the ELA exam 5/6 ENL &  SWD students  did not meet the criteria for ELA and 7/21 . This shows 16/27 did meet the ELA  criteria. In Math 3/6 ENL & SWD students and  1/21 did not meet the criteria for Math exam.  This shows 23/27 did mee the criteria in Math.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Materials we will utilize for our supplementary programs include tablets to support with  immediate acces to the itnernet and audio components. For the 2017-2018 academic year we  want to enure we provide ELLs with more opportunities to read non-fiction magazines and we  will purchase Action by Scholastic. This magazine is for a 3-5 grade reading level and  costs  8.99 per student. In addition we would like to purchase a subscription of BrainPop for  ELLs to use in afterschool and Saturday Program. Many teachers like to use Brainpop in class  and we would like to use the ESL resource that they offer which focuses on language  development. Another resource which we have found to support our ELLs is reading a-z and  NewsELA. Both of these resources offer differentiated resources with vocabulary and image  components that support langauge ddevelopment.    To support independent reading after school  we will purchase High Interest Low Level Books  from Saddle Back Publishing which gives students the opportunity to read engaging texts at their  level. We will purchase Kits that bring 40-50 books  for various independnet reading level  ranges, the cost is $250-$350 per kit. In addiiton we will celebrate ELL students who are reading  outside of the school day. During the 2016-2017 academic year we found High Interest Low  Level books were engaging for our ELL students.

The Queens South ELL Team offers various sessions to support all teachers. For the  2016-2017 academic the focus was supporting S.S teachers and we attended 4 sessions that  allowed us to look at strategies to support ELLs in this content. Starting summer 2017 we will  have ENL and non ENL teachers attending the summer sessions  and we will build capacity in  our school with all teachers. Some of the summer sessions are focused on scaffolds, language  phases and vocabulary which align with the interest and need of our staff. Some of the teachers  attending summer sessions are 2 ENL teachers, 1 Dance Teacher, 1 Math Teacher. Our goal is to  have our staff understand that we are all ENL teachers. Teachers who attend external PL sessions  will turn-key what they have learned with support from our ENL Coordinator, Mrs. Rodriguez.    At the end of the year we had our staff reflect on what professional development they feel they  need to support ELLS and staff wanted  PDs that focused on scaffolds, differentiation and  vocabulary development for our ELLs. Our In-House PDs will dedicate a few sessions for these  topics for all ENL teachers ( 4) and for teachers who expressed they needed support in these  areas.    Although we did not attend any  external PDs at the Center for Applied Linguistic during the  2016-2017 academic year we hope to send 2 ENL teachers to attend a PD that focuses on  Developing Academic Literacy and Language in Content Areas. This PD is taking place October   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part C: Professional Development   19-20, 2017 in Washington , DC and costs 900.00 per teacher plus lodging costs.

In addition to the  mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process we will hold 3- 4 additional meetings to support the different needs of our students. In  September we will have a  meeting  specific  for our 8th grade ELLS who will apply to high school. We have found ELL  families need  additional support in understanding the high school application process and  understanding what schools offer ENL programs that will support their children.  Another  meeting in September will also address the 6th grade ENL families to ensure they know how the  ENL model at MS358 works and how their children will be serviced. In addition we will focus  on bringing information about our academic vocabulary program, Word Generation to our ENL  families during workshops we will have during parent engagement time starting October 2017 on  a bi-monthly basis until the year ends. In 2016-2017 we found many families were interested in  our academic vocabulary program and we want to ensure we integrate our ENL families in this  excitement around vocabulary development.One last area we want to address with ENL families  is number sense in Math. With support from the Math Department we will offer a series of  workshops that provide basic ideas and resources that parents can use to support their students at  home with math. We will prepare ziplock baggy tools to address math in a fun engaging way that  is not intimidating for the families.  We will inform parents of these activities via letters send home in their preferred language, text  and phone messages and phone calls. We will ensure these communication efforts are made in a  timely manner and we are available to answer questions or concerns. We would also like to  understand what additional topics the parents of our ELLs want to further explore and will  include those in future meetings.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to determine the literacy skills of our ELLS we use the W.R.A.P and plan on using the Gates-MacGinite reading and  vocabulary assessment.  The W.R.A.P provides the independent , instructional and frustration grade reading level of each  student. The Gates-MacGinite provides a reading grade level  which is calculated by assessing reading comprehension and  vocabulary.  Currently we are also using blended learning programs to get deeper understanding of literacy levels of non-fiction reading.  The DRP assessment will provide a DRP score and range of lexile levels of our ELLs. This data is shared with all teachers and  allows teachers to plan instruction that is comprehensible for the ELL students.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Our baseline, and benchmark assessments support the monitoring of ELLs progress throughout the school year. Our data  meetings with the data specialist will also support our instructional planning. Each unit has a pre and post assessment which  will allow teachers to design assessments and use data to inform instruction.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Currently our ELL students are assessed 3 times per year with in house school wide assessments that are administered 3 times  a year. For the 2017-2018 we hope to also identify the NYC DOE ELL Periodic Assessment as a tool that can provide data about  language development progress.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our baseline, and benchmark assessments support the monitoring of ELLs progress throughout the school year. Our data  meetings with the data specialist will also support our instructional planning. Each unit has a pre and post assessment which  will allow teachers to design assessments and use data to inform instruction.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores of 2016 our  current 6th and 7th grade  ELL students had the most difficulty  with writing, next reading and lastly listening and speaking. This reveals we need to provide ample opportunities for students  to write  and connect speaking and listening as they are developing English in all classes.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The data specialist, ENL coordinator and teacher teams meet quarterly after each marking period to make adjustments to  increase student achievement. Our professional learning structures will support teachers practices to support ELL students  with having access to learning. Teachers will be support with providing scaffolds, and differentiation to meet students needs.  Our inquiry teams will identify the scaffolds and teaching strategies that are leading to the biggest gains in ELL achievement.  These strategies will be shared via an ENL department newsletter to the staff.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   For the 2017-2018 academic school year all ELLs are across the sixth and eight grades. All of our ELLs  ( all levels)  except those who are recommended to be in an ICT ( class 631, 731, 831) setting are grouped in one class ( class 603,  703, 803). Currently we have 6 ELLs in the self-contained, students with disabilities class (791) 5 ELLs in the self  contained, students with disabilities class (891) ,and we are projected to have 4 ELLs in our (691). Our commanding  ELLs are in our ELL class ( class 603).  For the 2017-2018 school year we will not have a stand alone model and will only  offer an integrated model.  Students are grouped by their English lanaguage proficiency evidenced by their NYSESLAT  and NYSITELL scores in addition to assessments given by the ENL Coordinator and school assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                  b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   At MS 358 we ensure all students are getting the mandated instructional ESL minutes by in August  while programming  students reviewing the proficiency levels of each ELL student and each student who has tested Commanding in the latest  NYSESLAT exam.  We refer to the new Implementations of CR Part154 ENL/ESL units table which indicates how many units and  in what setting each ELL will receive their instructional minutes for grades K-8. We currently have one ESL provider (ENL  Coordinator) who is a part of the integrated program.  According to need (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and  Commanding) the teacher will support students by providing the following:  Entering:     3 units of study per week (540 min) – 1 unit of Stand Alone ENL, 1 unit of Integrated ENL, 1 unit of Flexibility ENL   Emerging: 2 units of study per week (360 min) – .5 unit of Stand Alone ENL, 1 unit of Integrated ENL, .5 unit of Flexibility ENL  Transitioning: 1 unit of study per week (180 min) – No Stand Alone ENL, .5 unit of Integrated ENL, .5 unit of Flexibility ENL  Expanding: 1 unit of study per week (180 min) – No Stand Alone ENL, 1 unit of Integrated ENL, No Flexibility ENL  Commanding: .5 of Flexibility ENL ONLY        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    Our Model is an ESL integrated push-in model in ELA and other content areas . Students who are entering and emerging  receive ESL pullout services. Content core is delivered by ensuring collaboration between the ELA teachers and ENL teacher.  A  similar approach is taken for other content area teachers such as Social Studies, Science and Math.  The approach to this  model is supported by the S.I.O.P model which allows to make content comprehensible.  The ENL Coordinator collaborates and  plans directly with all teachers who service ELL students, modifying lessons and/or supporting students with additional  classroom resources.  Students are trained by the ENL Coordinator and other teachers to use glossaries,a thesaurus, dictionary  and electronic supports in class.  Students follow the CCLS and are exposed to various skills by both the ENL Coordinator and  their content area teachers  which are used when reading text.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   For ensuring that ELLS are evaluated in their home language throughout the year we will use support from the BFSC to support  us with this process.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ESL teachers will work with content teachers to differentiate instruction by providing techniques and strategies to make  content comprehensible for all of our subgroups (SIFE, newcomer, Developing, Long term ELLs and Commanding ELLs.  Common planning time with ESL and content teachers will allow us to differentiate for all the needs of our ELLs.a. Currently we  have no SIFE students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      b. All Ells are provided with the Common Core Learning Standard instruction in both content and literacy areas.   • The language arts instructional component is delivered using instruction in English with the use of ENL methodologies.   • Instruction is differentiated for beginner, intermediate, and advanced students with the use of scaffolding, extensive  modeling, and other ESL strategies. These strategies may include activating prior knowledge, building new experiences, using  visuals and vocabulary enrichment.   • Teachers scaffold at different levels during reading/writing workshop.   •Teachers provide support by pairing entering/emerging students with buddies who speak the same language or help them  learn English through interpersonal communication. Students will also be targeted for after school programs.   • Students who exit from the ESL program receive additional support, up to and including, 2 years beyond their date of  departure.  They will part of a transition program that will help them maintain proficiency in the English language.  •They will also continue to received testing modifications as needed with additional state approved testing supports.  c. Our long term plan for ELLs receiving services for approximately 6 years is the same as above. These students participate in  Inquiry Team groups and receive individualized/small group instruction by classroom, after school programs and ENL teachers.   d. Although we are currently a single grade school, we will expand adding  7th and 8th grades. Students will not be offered 6  years of continuous ELL service at our school as we only will have 3 grades.    e. Our plan for former ELLs is to provide students with differentiated instruction with the use of scaffolding techniques and  ENL methodologies. The students receive guided reading and strategy lessons in order to continue improving reading and  writing skills. They will also continue to received testing modifications as needed with additional state approved testing  supports.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Instructional strategies we are incorporating into our practice at M.S358  to provide access to academic content areas and  accelerate English language development are meeting the students needs by scaffolding. Through scaffolding our ELL students  will better understand more complex texts and will understand content. Examples of scaffolds we are using are learning  targets which allow students to know exactly what they are learning and how they will demonstrate what they have learned. In  addition we read-aloud readings in order to support students who are still not fluent readers. We also provide vocabulary  words on handouts that are related to the material being covered in specific units. Sentence frames and starters are also used  to support with speaking and writing in all classes. In addition in ELA we are grouping students with purpose, conferencing with  them about their reading and writing, modeling reading strategies and writing.    Ell students with disabilities whose IEP recommend ESL or bilingual instruction are provided with an instructional plan which  adheres to the IEP mandates. Short and long term goals are developed and provided to all teachers that support students.  In  addition to content area classrooms, our pull-out model classrooms solely used to support the needs of ELL students will be  well equipped with listening centers, leveled libraries, differentiated instruction workbooks as well as computers with software  and programs that will support student learning according to skill and age.  Students will also work in small groups and be  provided with scaffolding techniques at different levels as well as extensive modeling. Language Acquisition Checklists will be  used to support the delivery of content area instruction as well as language development. Codex, Achieve 3000, Think Cerca  and Reading and Writing units includes skills such as: reading comprehension, retelling of a story using key details, main idea,  graphic organizers, writing about reading, the sequence of a story and character development among other reading skills that  support comprehension development.      Students are assessed in reading and writing using the performance-based assessments however, ELL students will also receive  modifications to these assessments (ex. Format, time to respond, alternate modes of answering) to support the evaluation of  skill mastery. After the data has been analyzed students are grouped for guided reading, and small group instruction in order  to individualize instruction to improve their reading levels.      All teachers use the promethean board in order to promote students active participation. Services in ESL are provided  according to CR-Part 154 based on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores through the push-in model during content area instruction  in order to accelerate English language development. ESL-SWDs teachers develop Tier II vocabulary and sentence structure.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  M.S358 uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs achieve their IEP goals and attain English  proficiency with the least restrictive environment by having an ICT class in which students have two teachers for ELA and  Math. ELL-SWDs are grouped in a class which has students who are not classified as SWDs.  MS 358 differentiates instruction,  adapts curriculum and uses a flexible schedule to meet the needs of Ell-SWDs within the least restrictive environment by  also  letting students travel to various content area teachers. While in class, students are given additional supports through the  push-in/pull-out model.  ELL-SWD students are also given preference to afterschool programs that will promote reading  comprehension and language acquisition through the use of programs such as Achieve 3000.  A thorough reivew of IEP's in  addition to classroom observations are used to determine which setting best supports the students' needs.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  M.S. 358 will use supports for intervention before the school day, during the school day and after school. Targeted  intervention will support ELLs who demonstrate that they need more support in the content areas of Math, Social Studies, and  Science. During lunch periods there are opportunities for students to receive intervention and during 8th period for Advisory  and Talent. Students will also have opportunities before school and after school for other interventions. The Citizen Science  Program will support us with STEM instruction for ELLS in math and science afterschool.       Additionally, MS 358 will follow the steps of our RTI (Response To Intervention) support which is aimed at closing the  achievement gap for our at risk learners.  Entering/Emerging ELLs receive support developing their oral language through  shared reading and through language experience approaches. Students develop concept vocabulary through authentic  experiences and the use of Achieve 3000 which allows for each student to have text read to them and provides them the  opportunity to expand their vocabulary exposure.       Expanding and Transitioning ELLs receive targeted literacy/language support in the classroom by the classroom teachers, ESL  teachers, and the afterschool Citizen Science program teachers. This intervention support consists of a variety of supports  included shared reading opportunities,  oral language development, guided reading, shared writing, and interactive writing.  Students are taught individually and in small groups. In addition to the support from teachers, students work collaboratively  with students who are more proficient in the English language. Students also have access to the online program Achieve 3000.  Students access the program both in school and at home.      English language learners who continue to need more intensive support in literacy (students who are a year or more below  grade level) receive Tier II instruction by either an ESL teacher or RTI classroom level team member.  The RtI team members  consists of: The principal, ENL Coordinator, ESL teachers, Guidance Counselor, ELA Teacher and IEP teacher.  Students who do  not make sufficient progress in Tier II as demonstrated by observations, interim assessment and ongoing formative assessment  enter into Tier III.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For this academic school year we are considering a S.T.E.M program for ELLs which we have applied for, a study seminar  afterschool program and a Saturday ESL/Literacy Academy program.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   M.S358 is a new school and we don’t have any programs to discontinue; our goal is to be able to include future programs that  will support student need.  Should we need to discontinute a program, it would be as a result of not having enough students  that mandate the service and/or we find that the service does not support a least restrictive environment and restricts  students' learning.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs will be informed of all afterschool programs as we begin to develop them. We plan offering a S.T.E.M ESL program, a  study seminar program to begin in December and Saturday/ESL Literacy to begin in February.  We also offer extracurricular  activites such as soccer, basketball and dance as part of the afterschool program.  Information letters will not only be sent in  the parents’ preferred language, but will be individualized and given to students dependent upon their need.  MS 358 is  committed to ensuring that ELL students are provided opportunities to achieve the same educational goals and standards as  the general education population. Intensive content area language instruction is provided through ESL methodologies and  strategies within the Codex and CMP3 Math curriculum, which includes scaffolding instruction for Ells. The instruction for all  programs is provided in a small group setting, teachers plan together to insure that instruction is differentiated.  Teachers will  use checklists, extensive modeling and other ESL strategies to drive content area instruction as well as language development.  Skills such as retelling of the story, compare and contrast, summarizing questioning, predicting and main idea are practiced  through such instruction.      The teachers working in the literacy, math and ESL after school program will provide systematic, strategic and intensive  instruction in phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency and writing. The after  school math program incorporates vocabulary development through the introduction and use of mathematical sight words  and terminology. Oral language development is enhanced through the practice of problem solving and the sharing of strategies  used to solve math questions. Reading and writing skills will also be improved as students strategize and solve problems based  on the Common Core State Standards. The goals of this program is to increase problem solving skills, collecting math data to  provide more small group partner work, increasing higher order thinking skills through the use of read aloud with accountable  talk and problem solving. This will help support language acquisition and proficiency.     The use of laptops with visual clues to help students understand and interpret word problems through interactive promethean  boards. Laptops for the students are used to enhance ESL instruction and serve as a resource for ELL’s to support translation  and integration of skills needed to decipher through language.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Currently we have a laptop cart which all of our ELLS are using during ELA Excellence and Technology. In addition students are  participating in blended learning by participating in Achieve 3000 and ThinkCerca. Both programs along with instruction  support students in reading non-fiction texts at their level, individualized. The features of the program include audio reading  and vocabulary supports which benefit our ELLs as they are developing academic English.  Teachers also use promethean  boards to aid in the teaching of math, reading, writing, social studies, science and language modeling.  Activities are provided  to ensure that students experience assistance with their ability in devloping mastery.   Students will also receive resources in  their preferred language in addition to thos in the English language to support with acquisition of language.  Textbooks,  workbooks and translators are used and provided to students to be able to use while in class.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided in Science and Social studies by allowing students who speak Spanish and are ELLs to  utilize the curriculum ( texts)  in Spanish.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    In order to ensure all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs age and grade level the ENL coordinator is in  constant communication with administration about the needs of our current ELLs.  Required services and suppots correspond  to ELL’s grade and age levels which is determined by the ENL Coordinator who works closely in the selection of materials and  the modification of lessons to support their needs.  Services and resources are adapted for ELL/SWD students, while still being  appropriate with their cognitive needs as the curriculum that is used is set to meet the needs of incoming 6th  graders.  Scaffolds are included in the curriculum which support those students who need additional support.  Teachers work  together to also develop teacher made materials that will promote learning and help in the acquisition of language for our  students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Currently we have a laptop cart which all of our ELLS are using during ELA Excellence and Technology. In addition students are  participating in blended learning by participating in Achieve 3000 and ThinkCerca. Both programs along with instruction  support students in reading non-fiction texts at their level, individualized. The features of the program include audio reading  and vocabulary supports which benefit our ELLs as they are developing academic English.  Teachers also use promethean  boards to aid in the teaching of math, reading, writing, social studies, science and language modeling.  Activities are provided  to ensure that students experience assistance with their ability in devloping mastery.   Students will also receive resources in  their preferred language in addition to thos in the English language to support with acquisition of language.  Textbooks,  workbooks and translators are used and provided to students to be able to use while in class.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   For future new ELLs that are enrolled in our school we plan on having a buddy system where a student who speaks the same  home language can support them as they transition into our school. Currently we don’t have a partner coordinator but when  we do have one that person in collaboration with the ENL coordinator will ensure the student and family get integrated into  the school by inviting them to all functions and ELL parent meetings. In addition we new ELLs will be placed in an advisory  group that has students who have been new to the country and can support them as they enter our school. As a new school  with only one grade we are still developing activities that ensure all of our ELLs feel they are part of our community.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently no languages are being offered at M.S358.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  For the 2015-2016 academic school year our professional development plan for all ELL personnel in the school is to cover  topics in which teachers have expressed interest that will support their teaching practice for ELLs. Topics of interest include,  Scaffolding Techniques, Supplemental Materials, Vocabulary Instruction, Common Core and ELLs , Writing for ELLs  S.I.O.P.,Academic Vocabulary Acquisition ( York College).  We have professional development scheduled with our programs  which include Achieve3000, the Leader In Me, Think Cerca, Codex, CMP3 and will send Teachers in all content areas, Guidance  Counselors, Teachers, the Instructional Coach and ENL Coordinator to various professional development workshops as offered  by the New York City Dept of Education.        As a new school M.S358 will be looking at the PD opportunities offered by the Office of English Language Learners that are  focused on Common Core Learning Standards.  Professional Development for teachers instructional coach, paraprofessionals,  guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, and staff responsible for the delivery of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         instruction and services to English Language Learners are conducted throughout the school year. Records of meetings are  maintained by sign-in sheets and agendas.   The following professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs in  supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards:      ESL methodology and strategies.   Language Acquisition Stages and checklist.   ESL methodology and strategies using the Codex curriculum.    Differentiated instruction to meet the individual needs of ELLs. (Focus on oral language development for beginners and  intermediates,)   Providing ELL readers with the support they need to take the ELA, NYSESLAT, and Math exams.   Scaffolding and instructional strategies for teaching ELLs in all content areas.   Study groups will be conducted specific to the needs of ELL’s focusing on differentiating strategies to implement during Codex  and CMP3.   In-house Professional Development for new and experienced teachers consists of Codex and writing workshop, Charlotte  Danielson Framework for Teaching, ELA performance task, Data from ELA and Math assessment.      The administration ensures that all staff receives hours of ELL training during staff development days, in-house differentiated  professional development, and common prep times. Differentiation of Instruction for ESL students is an in-house ELL training  workshop presented by the ENL Coordinator. All teachers at MS358  have been provided with resource materials that they  have been using for their classroom instruction.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   In order to orient our staff regarding the transition of ELLs from elementary to middle school the ENL coordinator shares  information about the program the ELLs were enrolled in elementary school, the years of  ELL service each student has  received and the current proficiency level of each student. Both the Guidance Counselor and ENL Coordinator work together  and attend professional development opportunities offered in order to suppor the transition of students from Middle School  to High School.  The ENL Coordinator, Guidance Counselor and Instructional Coach will also be provided time in order to  prepare for incoming and outgoing ELL students during both transitions of coming in and leaving the school.      M.S 358 meets the professional development hours required by making sure 15% of the total hours for non ENL teachers and  50% total hours for the ESL are focused on improving instruction to support our ELLs.  Records of attendance and agendas are  kept by our ENL coordinator, Mrs. Rodriguez.              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      Annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss the goals of our program will be arranged by the ENL coordinator  and will happen on Tuesdays during family engagement time. Parents who can not meet on Tuesdays will be accommodated  to have phone conversations or to meet at different times. For parents who don’t speak English arrangements will be made  with the Translation and Interpretation Unit to provide interpretation and translation.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.    Ansswer to #2 Records for annual individual meeting will be kept by the ENL coordinator and the Instructional Coach in the  ENL compliance binder. Parents will be accommodated to ensure they can attend the annual individual meeting . Outreach to  schedule meetings will be done with enough time to give parents advance notice and parents who are not reached via phone  will receive a letter asking them to share a convenient time for their meeting.   Translation services will be provided through  the use of a community substitute teacher and/or the use of the translations serviced department to ensure that parents  receive information in the language of preference.  Answer to #3-In addition to the individual meeting parents of ELLs will be invited to an orientation meeting in October that  reviews the ELL program we are offering at M.S358.  At the meeting we will make sure to get the parents contact info to  ensure they can get important updates pertaining to their children.In December we will hold a multicultural potluck in which  parents of ELLs and students can share and celebrate each other's culture. In February we will have a game night in which we  play different board games and share games that are played in each country represented by our ELL students. For the  remainder of the year we will review the needs and interests of the parents to hold more activities.  Although we currently do  not have a parent coordinator, their role would be to work with the ENL Coordinator, ESL Teachers and Instructional Coach to  determine days in which translation services are needed and/or to support with the translation of various documents that  must be sent to parents.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Brendan Mims, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.         In order to assess language preferences of our parents for both written and oral communication we will look  at the Home Language Survey for newly identified ELLs and student emergency cards that all students provide.  In addition, advisory teachers will collect information using the Advisory 2018-2019 Spreadsheet which lists  advisory students and their specific advisory teacher. The spreadsheet will include a column that specifically  asks the preferred language of the family member both orally and written. This will be updated by advisory  teachers on an ongoing basis and will be a tool to plan how to best support all parents with all  communications. The spreadsheet will be shared with all staff members via a Google Document.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     There is no language that represents at least 10% population of MS358Q excluding the currently preferred  languages ( Bengali, Spanish).          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?

The newsletter is generated by the  last Tuesday of the month, the  document is translated by the last  Friday of the month, the newsletter is  printed on the opposite side of the  monthly school calendar and is  printed to be backpacked home and  emailed to all parents.   Critical information will be generated  by Thursday one month prior to the  event, the critical information  document will be translated by three  weeks prior to the event, The  document will be issued two weeks  prior to the event, and redistributed   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      PTA communication   September-June   one week before the event. In the  case of emergency communication  translation will be done by 2:00pm the  day the information needs to be  communicated.   The PTA will coordinate with the  Parent Coordinator and the Language  Access Team to translate PTA  communication ( events at school s,  workshops for parents) two weeks in  advance prior to an event. In the case  of emergency communication  translation will be done by 2:00pm the  day the information needs to be  communicated.           2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the case of emergency the Language Access Coordinator, Mrs. Rodriguez will meet with the LAC team which is  made up of Parent Coordinator, Community Associate, School Aide , Paraprofessionals ( who speak Spanish and  Bengali) and administration to look at the list we have of parents who prefer to communicate in another language  other than English and we will ensure we call these parents in the language they prefer to inform them of the  emergency. We also use phone message ( text) service available in Spanish and Bengali. If our staff members don’t  speak a language that parents prefer to speak , we ensure we us the Translation and Interpretation Service for in-  person and over the phone conversations.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      MS358 will ensure staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and what resources are  available by including this information in the Staff Handbook for the 2018-2019 academic year. In addition ,during  Parent Engagement time LAC and Parent Coordinator will support staff to ensure they know what resources are  available in the school and outside of the school to support with communicating with parents who do not speak  English. One resource we found that was especially beneficial for our staff was the Translation and Interpretation  Service.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      At MS358Q we make sure parents know about their translation and interpretation rights by having the Welcome  Signage in the office in all languages, providing the incoming 6th grade families a copy of the parents bill of rights,  ensuring we translate flyers, information about meetings and any other activities in the preferred language of the  families of our school community. We have translation equipment that we use at PTA meetings and other events to  ensure that parents have access to information in the language of their choice. The staff also uses the translation  services provided by the New York City Department of Education to support phone conferences with parents who  cannot make it to the school.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         One important mechanism we have used is speaking one to one with parents who we know are limited- English-  proficient and informing them that they can call the school and we will ensure we can communicate in their  preferred language. The LAC Team supports with language services of specific families. For the 2018-2019 we plan  on getting to know our 6th grade families to ensure we can provide the same language support as they become  members of the MS358Q family.    Our school has implemented the feedback by ensuring we have office staff that speaks Bengali and Spanish and  following up with phone calls in the language parents are comfortable.
