This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 56Q believes that our fundamental goal is to encourage lifelong learning:   Section 4: CEP Overview      In order for our school to flourish academically and socially, staff will bring an open mind regarding classroom  structure, curriculum, learning style, and teaching style to each teaching moment. Students and staff will learn  through collaboration and professional learning communities. Engagement will be founded on student choices and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      interests with a student directed environment. We believe that parents and staff need to work together to fully  support each child’s education. Education is a joy as well as personal empowerment.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 56Q has a rich cultural diversity. We have a unique structure as a grade 2-5 school. We have Inclusive  Collaborative Teaching (ICT) classes in grades 2, 3, 4, and 5, an ENL push-in class on each grade, and two bridge self- contained classes (grades 3/4 and 4/5). The staff has taken on the responsibility of collaboratively planning as a grade  on a weekly basis. Beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, we implemented Positive Behavior Intervention Support  (PBIS) in our school to promote both social and academic success. During the school year, parents are invited to  attend evening workshops in literacy, math, and science as well as in non-academic events including Mom and Me  Night, Dad and Me Night, and our Multicultural Night. We partner with HDR, a private engineering firm, which  support STEM learning and school-wide team building skills.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have inclusive Collaborative Teaching (ICT) classes in grades 2, 3, 4, and 5, two bridge self-contained classes  (grades 3/4 and 4/5), and an ENL push-in class on each grade. All students are placed in literacy classes during our  school-wide literacy block according to need and teacher proficiency.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   1 - P.S. 56Q has strong collaborative teacher teams. Eight teachers participated in our Math Collaboration Action  Research Program (CARP). They met weekly to conduct research, co-plan lessons, share best practices, analyze  student work and consistently collect data in order to choose next steps for instruction. Our areas of focus for the  2017-2018 school year were to expand these strategies to the rest of the staff to embed coherence in delivery of  math instruction to all children.      2 - In the 2017-2018 school year, we had 4 teachers participate in the Teacher Leadership Program acquiring  leadership skills as facilitators for CARP and grade level teams. We also had 4 teachers participate in extensive content  training in math through Algebra for All. This has transformed how children engage with math.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q056   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   387   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     PS 56Q has a strong, experienced, and committed staff. Rigor involves coherent instruction, challenging tasks, aligned  assessments and professional collaboration. Teachers attend high quality PD throughout the year in a continuous  cycle of improvement. We are focused on the Danielson's Framework for Teaching 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction  and 3c: Engaging Students in Learning.   Data from the school-wide universal screener, STARS, in administered three times a year, as is the Fountas & Pinnell  reading assessment. These two tools, in concert with teacher observations and student classroom performance,  inform grouping and progress. Combined information is analyzed individually, by class, grade and school-wide. Spring  2018 analysis of data indicated that 28% of targeted children made more than one year's progress, 47% of children  school-wide scored on or above grade level, 23% scored below grade level, and 30% scored far below grade level. Our  targeted population will be those children who scored below grade level rather that far below grade level. Children  scoring far below grade level will receive tier III intervention.   We also administer the Fountas & Pinnell reading assessment. Analysis of Spring 2018 data indicate that we exceeded  our 2017-2018 goal by 3% with 28% of targeted children making more than one year's progress. We attribute this  achievement to our unique school-wide grouping. PS 56Q implements a whole school approach to reading instruction.  Children are matched with teachers, not necessarily by grade but rather by reading level and teacher strengths.  Children are assessed three times a year and flexibly grouped according to movement or need. We have a dedicated  double literacy block of 90 minutes each day. We honor this time on task by making it a prep free time and by  designating specific school-wide trip days, so as not to interfere with literacy and hold it as a school-wide priority.   Our 2018 School Learning Survey indicated that 100% said that teachers talk with one another about instruction, 96%  of teachers said that the school has well-defined learning expectations for all students, and 93% of teachers say that  students feel challenged and have to work hard to do well. Additionally, 97% of families say that they are satisfied  with the education their child received this year. Our strength derives from our school's two-year participation in the  Collaborative Action Research Program (CARP), that utilized research to identify strategies and resources to deepen  student agency, where children are active participants in their own learning process. The work from the CARP Literacy  Team will be presented to all staff at the September 2018 faculty conference to share the structures and strategies,  provide the necessary resources and clarify the expectations. This will support our continuing efforts to deliver  coherence of instruction school-wide.   Our goal for the 2018-2019 school year is to have 30% of targeted children scoring below grade level but not far  below grade level to make 1.5 years of progress.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Our next step for multiple grade level planning sessions is to align each grade to school-wide strategies and  approaches. We will form a multi-grade Literacy Team to be supported by the NYC DOE Collaborative Action Research  Project, (CARP). CARP staff will focus on studying the teaching and learning aspects of an issue, collaboratively  designing an action plan and systemically implementing that plan with ongoing progress monitoring with the  professional expertise of the CARP DOE staff.   Our goal for the 2018-2019 school year in literacy is to continue to use research, student input and outside  professional expertise to support our effects to motivate students to read and write. Throughout the 2018-2019  school year, the CARP Literacy team will create student and teacher surveys, design lessons and analyze student work  related to reading and writing. Teachers will focus their research on ways to motivate students to write on task and  increase student agency in writing.   By June 2019, CARP team teachers will create at least 2 units of study in literacy that connect the text students are  reading to a writing task.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  The 2018-2019 school year schedule is designed to create a school-wide literacy block during periods 3 and 4. We will  utilize our resource of staff teaching experience and successful collaboration. In addition to all classroom teachers,  additional groups will be formed and taught by our ENL teacher and gym teacher. Three cluster teachers, will also  push in one period each day to an assigned group. The support of each of these staff members will assist us in  reducing the teacher-student ratio.

Our 2016-2017 Learning Survey indicated that 100% of  teachers agreed or strongly agreed that at "their school, teachers talk with one another about instruction." In  reviewing our curriculum maps school-wide for the 2017-2018 school year, it was determined that we need to better  align content and skills between the grades. Our previously established Vertical Planning Teams for literacy, writing,  and math met at least once a month. There were struggles with goals setting, communicating to the larger school- wide community and alignment across the curricula. There is a need for more definitive team leadership and data  driven professional learning communities. In order to establish this consistency and productivity both within each  subject area as well as across the teams, three staff members will participate in the NYC DOE Teacher Leadership  Program in the 2018-2019 school year. They will develop leadership skills to lead more effective team efforts. One of  those teachers will serve as team leader for the CARP Literacy Team, one will serve as the lead for our CARP Math  Team, and the third teacher will support the grade 4 Algebra for All Team. See CEP Goal 5C.      In our three years of implementing the Positive Behavior Intervention System, (PBIS), we have made several advances  including the establishment of a common language, common expectations with a behavior/consequence rubric, and a  focus on supporting the needs of targeted students. As we moved to address the needs of a targeted population with  socialization needs, our monthly grade-level PBIS assemblies became more informative in nature rather than intrinsic  in impact.   In September and October of the 2017-2018 school year, we experienced a reduction of 70% of children assigned  supervised lunch. We noted children's increased willingness to talk out problems. As a result, we will follow student  readiness and promote more student voice and provide problem solving strategies.      One very effective outcome of our PBIS program was the implementation of "Starbucks," a recognition system for  meeting expectations for both individuals and classes. From the inception of our PBIS discussions, we decided that we  wanted recognitions be non-tangible rewards opting for an extra computer period, a free period in the yard, a no  homework pass, etc. The incidents where the expectations and recognitions were the most consistent over the school  year, were morning line-up and lunchroom behavior. As a result, we will continue issuing Starbucks in the 2018-2019  school year. It will be reviewed to reflect updated goals and needs by a PBIS Team three times a year.       Going forward, we need to design a school-wide system for communicating expectations in all aspects of school life,  addressing personal responsibilities and social awareness. PBIS is founded on Respect, Responsibility and Ready to  Learn. It will be the work of the PBIS Team to maintain the effective aspects of the program while incorporating three   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17      aspects: present direct information on bully prevention and appropriate responses, design assemblies to focus on  specific language and strategies in regards to bully prevention and response to bullying, and redesign the role of PBIS  going forward based on student needs/data.

As identified in goal 5A of this CEP for Rigorous Instruction, students math levels increased due to teacher  participation in the Collaborative Action Research Project (CARP). Due to the success of the program, we have decided  to establish a CARP Team this school year to research ways to increase teacher and student feedback in writing and  mathematics.   As per our last Principal Performance Observation, October 19, 2017, it was indicated that an area of focus is to align  the lesson objective and instruction to the assessment and provide students with meaningful feedback.   In order to establish consistency of best feedback practices in writing and mathematics, fourteen teachers in grades  2,3 and 5 will participate in the Collaborative Action-Research Project, CARP to research feedback. CARP is a NYC DOE  program offered through the Office of Curriculum, Instruction and Professional Development Learning in the Division  of Teaching and Learning. It is a professional learning community of school, borough and central-based educators who  engage in the school-level collaboration action research. It is a process that involves identifying research questions  based on problems of practice, constructing action plans evaluating the problems of practice with data and research  and using lessons learned to make changes that impact student learning, teacher practice and school-wide systems  and structures change.   Teachers will attend professional development during the school year.. Teachers will meet a minimum of 10 hours a  month to:   - Develop a problem statement and research question   - Collect and analyze identified data   - Share learnings across the school and system   - Participate in professional learning   - Meet 2-4 times per month in CARP team meetings at school   - Participate in the on-line learning community   Based on this year's CARP observations and discussions, gaps were identified in the area of teacher and student  feedback. In order to provide structure, consistency, and support, staff will participate in the Collaborative Action- Research Program.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Student Led Conference Goal   One of our primary goals for parent involvement at PS 56Q is home-school collaboration to support students'  academic success. In the past, the home-school connection has included parent teacher conferences and parent  workshops. Parent workshops are held on topics related to the Common Core standards and areas of need/concern in  each of the grade areas (science, math, literacy, internet safety, etc.) with an average attendance of 40 families. Our  parent teacher conferences are well attended with an average 92% rate.    However, the short amount of time allotted for parent teacher conferences do not provide sufficient time to discuss  students as whole learners. While teachers have used parent engagement time on an as needed basis to connect and  collaborate with parents, not all parents participate. We will add a new structure into our parent engagement time on  Tuesday afternoons to encourage student and parent participation in partnership with teachers in the education of  the children.   In the past, parent teacher conferences consisted of a conversation between teacher and parent. The student, if  parent chose or teacher requested, was a bystander in the conversation with little input as to the topic of  conversation of discussion as to next steps. Student led conferences will further develop student agency and allow  students to have a voice in creating academic goals, setting a plan to achieve these goals, and reflecting on their  growth.   In the 2017-2018 school year, our CARP literacy team explored the role of student agency in increasing student  engagement and progress. When instructional practices were adjusted to reflect student input, there was a noted  improvement in the quality and quantity of student independence and productivity. We want to expand and respect  the student role as a contributing voice in student success.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 56Q School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

ENL/ELA literacy program will run from September 26, 2018 to  December 20, 2018 two days/week, Wednesdays and Thursdays, for 24 instructional sessions of  1 hour. The Literacy/ NYSESLAT Test Prep will run from  January 2, 2019 to June 13,  2019  two days/week, Wednesdays and Thursdays,  for 40 instructional sessions of 1 hour.   As of June 20,  2018, we have identified 98 LEP students (not including FELLs) that are  receiving ENL services. The ENL After school program will target about 35 LEP students in  grades 2 – 5 at different proficiency levels as identified by the NYSESLAT. Group size will be  maintained at about 15 students per teacher. The main purpose of the program will be to support  English Language development through a repertoire of research based strategies and Common  Core Aligned tasks and texts. Since students in grades 3 -5 take standardized exams, the Spring  session will provide ample opportunities for students to improve their English literacy skills and  additional support in test preparation.   When grouping the students the teachers will take into consideration their language proficiency  levels based on the 2018 NYSESLAT.   In addition, teachers will analyze data from assessments  used to identify students' strengths and weaknesses, such as Fountas & Pinnell reading levels,  and ELL Periodic Assessments.   ENL/ELA literacy after school program will run from September 26, 2018 to December 20,  2018, 2 days/week, Wednesdays and Thursdays, for 24 instructional sessions of 1 hour. This  program will address the needs of our 2nd and 3rd graders in all areas of literacy development:  oral language, listening comprehension, reading, and writing. The New York State certified ENL  teacher will work on fundamental literacy skills such as vocabulary development, activating  prior knowledge, text representation, meta-cognitive development, and building schema. The  teacher will use picture dictionaries, leveled library books, and technology to facilitate the  acquisition of academic English. Students will work on rigorous Common Core Aligned tasks  that promote English language development. The instruction will be in English. Students whose  IEP mandates a bilingual paraprofessional will be supported by their bilingual paraprofessional.    Literacy/ NYSESLAT Test Prep after school program will run from January 2,  2019 to June 13,  2019 2 days/week for 40 instructional sessions of 1 hour. Most of the students from grades 4- 5  that will participate in this program have scored Advanced on the 2018 NYSESLAT. The New  York State certified ENL teacher will use Common Core Aligned texts, fiction and non-fiction,  to address the needs of the students.

In addition to “New York ELLs” the teacher will use graphic organizers, visual  aids, leveled books, and books on tape/CD to accelerate student learning. This after school  program will provide additional literacy support and will help students get ready for the  standardized tests. This program will target 4th and 5th graders.  The students will get ample  opportunities to be exposed to Common Core Aligned materials and have scaffolds in place to  access them. The teacher will also use “Exploration in Non-fiction Writing" to support students  in writing. Students whose  IEP mandates a bilingual paraprofessional will be supported by the  bilingual paraprofessional.   As mentioned above, we purchase research based programs and Common Core aligned texts that  facilitate language learning and acquisition. We also analyze students’ assessment to determine  the quality of supplemental materials that we purchase for ELLs. ENL teachers consult with the  Principal and other classroom teachers when buying and implementing new programs and  materials.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 56Q utilizes a wide range of assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of ELL students. We use Fountas & Pinnell to  assess students’ reading levels in grade 2-5.  This includes running records, reading accuracy, fluency, and reading  comprehension. This assessment is performed three times a year and we use the data to drive our differentiated instruction.  This data provides us with valuable information about our ELLs and their literacy level. We set benchmarks for our students  and revisit them periodically to identify ways to better reach our ELL population. This data is used to inform decision making  and drive differentiated instruction. This year students will be placed in Literacy Groups to target their individual needs. Within  the Literacy block students will receive  Students Guided Reading instruction based on their reading level. They are exposed  and assessed on various reading strategies while they read a book on their instructional level.   In addition, this year we will use STARS, an online reading assessment as a diagnostic and progress monitoring tool. Students  will take the reading assessment 3 times a year and teachers will be able to analyze and target students’ needs. Teachers also  analyze the data from Literacy unit assessments and use the data to group the students and facilitate instruction at their level.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Also, we administer the EASY CBM to our incoming 2nd graders to assess early literacy skills such as phonemic awareness,  sight word reading, and fluency. We will utilize this data to create reading groups that will target their individual needs.  We  will also administer the ELL assessment in the fall and spring. The ENL teacher will analyze the results and share the  information at ELL team meeting to adjust instruction as necessary.      Analyzing the school wide data we have observed that most of our ELLs are reading below grade level. . The following is  example of the breakdown for ELL's performance levels in reading using Fountas & Pinnell Assessment in May 2017:      Grade 2  3 ELLs reading at AA level (-13 reading levels)  2 students reading at B level (- 11 reading levels)  3 students at  reading level  D (-9 reading levels)  2 students at level E (-8 reading levels)  2 students reading at level F (-7reading level)  1 student at reading level G (-6 reading level)  5 students at reading level H (-5 reading level)  2 students at reading level I (-4 reading level)  2 students at reading level J (-3 reading level)  2 students at reading level K (-2 reading level)     Grade 3     2 students reading at D level(-12 reading levels)  2 students reading at E level (-11 reading levels)  4 students at level F (- 10 reading levels)  2 students at level G (-9 reading level)  2 students at level H (-8 reading levels)  3 students at level I (-7 reading levels)  1 student at level K (-5 reading levels)  6 students at level M (-3 reading levels)  1 student at level N (-2 reading levels)     Grade 4     2 students reading at A level(-18 reading levels)  2 students reading at C level(-16 reading levels)  2 student reading at D/E level (-15/-14 reading levels)  4 students reading at F/G level (-13/-12 reading levels)  3 students reading at M level(-6 reading levels)  3 students reading at O level (-4 reading levels)  2 students reading at P level (-3 reading levels)     Grade 5  3 student reading at A/B level (-21/-20 reading levels)  3 students reading at level D/E (-18/-17 reading levels)  3 students reading at level K (-11 reading levels)  3 students reading at level M/N(-9/-8 reading levels)  3 students reading at level P/Q (-6/-5 reading levels)  3 student sreading at level R (-4 reading levels)     Almost all of our newly admitted students are reading at more than 10 reading levels below grade expectations).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         This year we will analyze all the data and move towards a Literacy block. All students will be placed in reading groups that  could target their individual needs. Ongoing assessment strategies will be used to determine movement towards acquiring  content standards. On going assessment will be designed to collect evidence of student learning or need for changes to their  placement. As it has been in the past few years,  content area instruction will be aligned to Common Core Learning Standards.  The analysis of the data will enable teachers to mediate the learning of various proficiency classifications: newcomers, SIFE,  long-term ELLs, SWDs ranging from Entering to Commanding levels. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom  teachers to evaluate student work and data to ascertain the language and cognitive demands of tasks aligned to CCLS.  Teachers will continue to design lessons that meet CCLS while there is differentiated instruction to meet student’s individual  needs and language acquisition level.      Students will also be given informal assessments throughout the school year. These assessments will be aligned with CCLS and  the units of study. ENL Teacher and classroom teachers will analyze these assessments during monthly meetings to modify or  adjust their instruction. Students will also be placed in Literacy groups that will target their individual needs. Students will be  assessed three times a year and will be able to move to a new literacy group if they meet the objectives.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Students are grouped in literacy classes by their reading levels and provided reading and writing instruction in small groups to  target their individual needs.  Students are assessed 3 times a year and, in case of growth, are transferred into the appropriate  group .     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  There are various ways how we evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs. We analyze the data from the ELA, Math, and  Science exams to see how our ELLs are performing comparable to non-ELL students. In addition, our school has been  consistently meeting the AYP for ELLs. We also analyze the data from the NYSESLAT and ELL Periodic Assessment. We look for  trends and our students' performance to see which parts of our programs need to be revamped . We look at our ELL  performance compared to ELLs in comparable schools.  Throughout the year teachers perform on-going assessments designed  to collect evidence of student learning and progress.  Teachers also analyze GO Math assessments to analyze the students  progress in math and incorporate the results in their flexible grouping.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data has been gathered, students are provided targeted instruction in small groups based on their needs.  Their  progress is analyzed every 6 weeks and data is shared with classroom teacher, PPT team and ENL teacher.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The School Leadership Team and teachers use data to inform decision making and drive instruction for ELLs within the  Response to Intervention framework. We pay close attention to those components of RTI implementation that are specific to  meeting ELL’s needs and show promise for supporting ELLs’ academic outcomes. We have established a systematic process for  examining how ELL’s backgrounds and educational contexts have an impact on their academic achievement in our classrooms.  As applicable, we assess first and second language proficiency of the students. Also, we analyze the educational history to gain  more insight into the students. The School Leadership Team and teachers have established a plan to gather information  through formal and informal assessments.   We have established universal screening assessments that might give clear indications of how a student is performing relative  to peers of the same age or grade level. As required by State regulations when a new student comes to our school, the parents  complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). The ENL teacher analyzes the information to see if there are any  factors that might influence the English language acquisition and make informed decisions regarding linguistically responsive  instructional choices. In addition, the ELL students take part in RTI screening to assess whether the literacy skills meet grade  level benchmarks. The PPT team confers with the classroom teachers and ENL teacher . Students are administered a baseline   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         assessment and then the team decides on a goal for the student to work with a specialist. Progress monitoring is performed  for 2-8 weeks in Tier II and Tier III to decide on the next steps: whether is increasing the intensity of instruction or modifying  the goal. If an ELL student is flagged at-risk on any particular skill or competency that student receives targeted instruction to  support development in this area. This support is provided in coordination with language support services. The ELL students  are provided with the same structure and support system as other students in the RTI framework.   Furthermore, teachers take important steps to provide strong core instruction (Tier I). They strive to make lessons meaningful  to students and develop language and literacy across the curriculum. Teachers target rigorous and challenging instructional  goals while simultaneously providing students with supports they need to achieve success. Students also receive targeted  interventions to support ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills measured. During these interventions  teachers perform progress monitoring to see how these students are responding to instruction. This data is used to make  educational decisions such as changes in goals, instruction, or services. This data is discussed regularly during our bimonthly  PPT meetings to inform our further instructional steps.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   At PS 56 we analyze the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data at the beginning of the school year and throughout the year as needed.  Looking at the data of Spring 2017 NYSESLAT  we have 5 students who scored at the Entering Level, 13 students who scored at  the Emerging level,  31students who scored at the Transitioning level, and 40 students who scored at the Expanding Level.  12  out of 17 new admits that were administered the NYSITELL in September and October 2016  scored at the Entering level.  During the administration of the test it was also observed that 5 of these students lack early literacy skills in their native  language (Spanish/Bengali/Arabic). The ENL teacher shared this information with the classroom teachers and they will  continue to collaboratively develop lessons that target these students’ needs.   Our Entering/Emerging students make up the majority of our 2  nd   and  3  rd   grade ELL population.  In 2  nd   and 3   rd    grade this year we are using the CCLS aligned curriculum, Journeys, which incorporates differentiated instruction for ELLs  enabling all students to access the curriculum at their level. ELL students and Former ELLs will participate in small group, task- oriented situations that guide the production of language both in verbal and written form. Most of our Expanding students are  in our 2  nd   grade as well. However, our informal assessments  indicate that these students lack early literacy skills. We will  continue to use the research based program, Journeys, to facilitate the academic and social language development of our  second graders, while they are provided rigorous instruction with high expectations. In addition, students will received  phonemic instruction through Fundations to accelerate their phonemic and phonological awareness skills.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher creates a spreadsheet of students in each level and disseminates the information to all classroom teachers,  Science teachers, and related services staff.  This information is updated throughout the school year.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    PS 56 Q has a freestanding ENL program based on program choice forms and number of ELL's enrolled at our school.  ELL students are grouped heterogeneously  and they receive integrated and standalone ENL as specified by the new  CR Part 154. Students who score at the Entering level receive 360 minutes of ENL (180 minutes of standalone ENL  provided by the NYS certified ENL teacher in a pull-out model and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA provided in a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         co-teaching model by the ENL teacher  and classroom teacher). Students who score at the Emerging level receive 360  minutes of ENL (180 minutes of standalone ENL provided by  certified ENL teacher and 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA provided in a co-teaching model by the ENL teacher and classroom teacher). Students who score at  Transitioning level receive 180 minutes of ENL ( 90 minutes of ENL/ELA provided in a co-teaching model by the ENL  and classroom area teacher and 90 minutes of standalone ENL provided by the ENL teacher). Student who score at  the Expanding level receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or content area provided in a co-teaching model.  Students who score at the Commanding level receive 90 minutes of ENL provided in a co-teaching model.  Former  ELLs receive ENL services for 2 years after reaching the proficient/commanding level. Former ELLs are placed in ENL  classrooms to facilitate their transitioning and delivery of instruction since the ENL certified teacher pushes in these  classrooms. In case they are in another class they are brought into the ENL classrooms when the ENL teacher pushes  in to deliver integrated ENL instruction.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              In accordance with new CR Part 154, PS 56Q has structured its ENL program to provide all ELL students with the  appropriate amount of ENL, ELA, and HLA. PS 56Q ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided  according to proficiency levels by placing the students in one classroom per grade unless the students have an IEP that  requires ICT or 12:1:1 placement.  Services are provided by our NYS licensed ENL teacher and dually certified classroom  teacher as outlined above in (a). Students who score at the Entering level receive 360 minutes of ENL (180 minutes of  standalone ENL provided by the NYS certified ENL teacher in a pull-out model and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA provided  in a co-teaching model by the ENL teacher  and classroom teacher). Students who score at the Emerging level receive 360  minutes of ENL (180 minutes of standalone ENL provided by  certified ENL teacher and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  provided in a co-teaching model by the ENL teacher and classroom teacher). Students who score at Transitioning level receive  180 minutes of ENL ( 90 minutes of ENL/ELA provided in a co-teaching model by the ENL and classroom area teacher and 90  minutes of standalone ENL provided by the ENL teacher). Student who score at the Expanding level receive 180 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA or content area provided in a co-teaching model. Students who score at the Commanding level receive 90  minutes of ENL provided in a co-teaching model.  Former ELLs receive ENL services for 2 years after reaching the  proficient/commanding level.  Native Language Support is incorporated in the instruction through bilingual glossaries, books in  students' native languages, and computer translated materials. Students are encouraged to respond and write in native  language if applicable.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Content area instruction is delivered by licensed teachers, who have been involved in both internal and district/citywide  professional development  to meet the needs of ELL students in the classroom. They work to differentiate their instruction to  faciliate the lower level ELL's comprehension. Core content is taught in English using ESL methodologies and best practices to  make content comprehensible for ELLs.   Our school follows the Reader's and Writer's workshop model. The ENL teacher is invited to participate in grade meetings to  facilitate planing and instruction. The ENL teacher and teachers of ELLs have common planning time to collaborate and make  adjustments to instruction. Content lessons are based on grade level curriculum and language instruction is centered around  linguistic demands/functions on a topic.  NLA support is provided in all content areas. Students use glossaries, word to word  dictionaries, buddy support, computer translated materials. Students use native language to respond to the text and complete  tasks.    Students are taught academic functions (analyzing, describing, comparing, contrasting, inferencing, etc). while incorporated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      language lessons provide a way for grammar instruction. Students set individual goals in reading and writing (depending on the  unit of study). All instruction is aligned to CCLS. Parents receive a progress report explaining the students' goals and steps we  are taking to meet these goals. During our parent teacher conferences the parents discuss these goals with the teachers.  Parents are encouraged and invited in various workshops throughout the year to help support the learning of their child,  providing a bridge between home and school.             The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teachers to deliver literacy instruction as well as to tailor additional content  instruction to meet the needs of ELLs.  We use scaffolding strategies and differentiated instruction based on their proficiency  level and needs to accomplish their participation in grade level content.  Teachers integrate reading into learning expeditions  to teach content and to develop literacy skills. An anchor text or texts are chosen for read alouds to help teach expedition  content. Readers’ workshop is used to teach decoding, comprehension strategies, learning expedition content, and to scaffold  expedition products. Literature circle texts often relate to the expedition theme, illuminate guiding questions, and build  background knowledge. Texts selected for learning expeditions include a variety of genres and primary sources. Classrooms  contain libraries with an assortment of resources, including texts related to expeditions, student-produced books, primary  sources, and a range of media, genres, and levels. Conferencing with students is an ongoing practice and provides an  opportunity for teachers to measure progress toward meeting and exceeding grade level standards. PS 56 staff members  attend various workshops throughout the year to stay abreast of current research and strategies.                During Writing, students use various scaffolds such as sentence builders, graphic organizers, and closely activities.  These strategies provide our ELLs with support while challenging them to learn the content. Teachers develop and teach a  common language for the writing process and the components of writing and use consistent practices for teaching and  assessing writing. While the nature and amount of writing vary by discipline and grade level, writing is a major tool in all  content areas. Teachers have a common understanding and language for teaching the components of writing Teachers  explicitly teach writing through mini lessons, writers’ workshops, and models. Teachers use their own writing to model the  writing and revision process. Anchor charts document student understanding of the elements of good writing.            In Math, teachers promote flexibility in mathematical thinking by encouraging different ways to solve problems. We use  the Common Core aligned program "Go Math" . Teachers help students develop efficient problem-solving techniques.  Students show the thinking behind their answers through numbers, words, graphs, and diagrams. Students make use of  manipulatives as tools for thinking and representing. They also use glossaries, buddy support, word dictionaries to facilitate  their learning.           Teaching ESL through content and differentiated instruction also prepares our newcomers for the New York State Exams.  The students are exposed to a variety of literature, learn various reading strategies, write different genres, develop problem  solving techniques, which prepares them for the state tests. In addition, students who are new to the country and have  background knowledge in their native language may take the test in their native language or with a translator.  Language instruction is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. ENL teacher and teachers of ELLs scaffold academic  language to support students' participation in content areas. Teachers use a rich repertoire of scaffolds to supports students'  understanding of the main academic content. Teacher models  the use of the academic language in ways which students are  expected to respond and participate. The ENL teacher ensures that language structures and functions are taught within the  context of the lesson.    Our current instructional program is designed to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the  demands od the Common Core Learning Standards. Classroom teachers collaborate with the ENL teacher to ensure that  content presented in the English Language is made comprehensible to ELLs through appropriate application of ESL language  learning methods and strategies, such as described above in the narrative. Additionally, the ENL teacher collaborates and  provides PDs to RTI and related service providers to ensure that appropriate strategies, methods, and approaches are utilized  during service sessions.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students are appropriately evaluated in their native language by ensuring their entitlement to translated state exams,  bilingual  glossaries and other pertinent evaluation materials. The ENL teacher makes sure to disseminate memos and bilingual  glossaries to classroom teachers. The Spanish LAB is also used to evaluate ELLs whose home language is Spanish.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   a.   SIFE     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       a.     We currently  have no SIFE students. In case SIFE students enroll at PS 56Q we are prepared to implement  ENL strategies  to facilitate learning. In the past we have used differentiated instruction and scaffolding strategies based on the students'  needs and level. Students will receive additional literacy instruction on top of the mandated instructional minutes by the ENL  teacher.    b.     Our newcomers  who are at different stages of language acquisition are placed in flexible groups, so they listen to the  modeled language of the more advanced students while completing their tasks. Examples of differentiated instruction at the  Entering/ Emerging and transitioning levels are evident in all areas of language development. The implementation of  research  based reading programs “Journeys” in grade 2/3 and "Cornerstone" in grade 4  provides ample opportunities in accelerating  standard academic language learning.  “Journeys” and "Cornerstone" provide challenging content-based language  development and learning strategies that help students achieve academic goals.  In addition, all ENL classes have established a  Listening Center, which will be utilized as a center during Independent Reading Periods. We use "Fundations", a phonics based  program, to help our newcomers in reading. New students also use the web based site "Starfall" and Raz-Kids to help them  with reading and phonological awareness.   c.     We have 6 LEP students who have received services for more than three years.  All 6 of these students, who also have an  Individualized Educational Plan,  scored at the Emerging  level on the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT. The ENL teacher met with the  classroom teachers and used the analysis of the 2017 NYSESLAT and ELA to identify the areas of need. Looking at this data we  identified that these students are proficient in speaking but they do not do very well in reading and writing. We also identified  the areas of weakness, such as making predictions, summarizing, identifying main idea and making inferences. In writing we  discovered that these students lack organization skills and usage of a wide vocabulary. We created a plan emphasizing reading  and writing development. During our ENL/ELA periods for these students, we will examine different genres by looking at  similarities and differences, organization, style, vocabulary, and author's purpose. Using the Reader's and Writer's workshop  the students initially write a joint text with the teacher and later they write independently.   d.     We currently do not have any long term ELLs. In case long-term ELLs transfer to our school we have a good instructional  plan in place to meet their particular needs. Teachers will implement a rich repertoire of scaffolds to support students'  understanding of the main content and assist them in achieving language proficiency.   e.     Students who tested Proficient/Commanding on the NYSESLAT 2016 and 2017 will continue to receive support systems to  help them succeed. These students will receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction provided by the certified ENL teacher. Most of  them are placed in classrooms where the ENL teacher pushes in and they will receive language development support by the  ENL teacher and classroom teachers. These students will continue to receive ELL testing accommodations for all exams as  mandated.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All special education students are given the same instructional services as their peer general education ELLs. Our plan for ELLs  who have been assessed as having special needs includes a close collaboration with the Special Education teachers to identify  and work with their particular accommodations. Differentiated instructional strategies are used in the classroom to help assist  the students with comprehension and understanding. Based on their IEP and collaboration with the special education  teachers, instruction is tailored to meet the students' language needs as well as providing support with any cognitive needs the  students might have.  We have several reading programs to target their needs, such as Journeys, Fundations, Expeditionary  Learning and Wonders.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  PS 56Q uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse academic and linguistic needs of ELL-SWDs  within the least restrictive environment. All ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment according to the  requirements indicated on the most current IEP of each child. The ELL-SWDs whose IEPs require an alternate placement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      paraprofessional are assigned a bilingual paraprofessional in the classroom. Additionally, the alternate placement  paraprofessional accompanies the ELL-SWD student when they receive Standalone ENL Instruction in a pull-out setting.   The ENL, special education teachers, and classroom teachers collaborate in weekly team, grade, and department meetings to  discuss and share students' progress in order to ensure that each ELL-SWD is afforded instruction appropriate to his/her  language and learning needs. The ENL teacher coordinates with the students IEP to teach to the students strengths. ELL  students with disabilities receive ENL support and instruction based on their NYSESLAT proficiency level. The Common Core  aligned curriculum is adapted to meet their needs. Instruction is provided in a variety of settings: one on one, small group, and  whole class. ELL-SWDs are encouraged to participate in various educational class trips and in large school  communities.  Additionally, alternate placement paraprofessionals accompany ELL-SWDs to whom they are assigned to to ENL  instruction class.                        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas include collaboration with classroom  teachers to identify students who need extra help or are at risk; RTI services to provide at risk students with additional  support; and using STARS or other computer based programs. This year students will participate in Literacy Groups designed to  target their specific needs. Most interventions are offered in English with the option of translations being made available when  necessary. The ENL teacher also frequently checks with the classroom teachers and PPT members to evaluate student progress  and to monitor targeted intervention for students at risk. The intervention services offered at our school range from after  school programs to RTI/small group instruction in ELA and Math. Students are regularly scheduled for RTI services with  experienced teachers based on their needs.     Some of our targeted intervention programs for ELLs (including our ELL newcomers, ELL-SWD, and students at Expanding level)  include: the After school  Program where they can get additional help to fulfill their needs in reading, writing and math. This  year we will  offer it as an after-school tutoring program for reading and math. Within their own classrooms their teachers will  support these ELLs through the CCLS reading  programs, Balanced-Literacy approach and Go Math Mathematics Program . The  languages that these interventions are available in is in English at this time. ENL teacher and classroom teacher utilize the  Spanish version of Go Math as well.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year we will continue to target full compliance with servicing our ELL population as per new changes  to CR Part 154. We will start our Literacy Block where students will be grouped according to their reading levels and individual  needs.   Students will be assessed on their reading level 3 times a year and will be transferred to their appropriate group  accordingly.  The ENL teacher and classroom teachers will continue to have common planning time to facilitate collaboration  and cohesion of instruction. Professional development time will be structured  in a way that inquiry teacher teams will analyze  the effectiveness of our literacy groupings and provide professional development for classroom teachers regarding ELL  strategies. Staff members are given training in periodic professional development seminars, held both on-site and off-site,  throughout the year.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   3  rd   grade ESL classroom will discontinue the use of the current reading program and will implement CCLS aligned  program  "Journeys" which offers a more rigorous vocabulary and in-depth text analysis.          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All school programs, during and after school, are open to our entire student body.  ELL students have opportunities to choose  classroom jobs, engage in whole class discussions, be a color guard at morning line up, be a ball monitor during  recess,  participate in grade level events such as the Dance Festival, multicultural events, and other activities. They are also  encouraged to apply to the After school program that is housed in our building. At PS 56Q we make it a priority that teachers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      encourage ELL students to join school programs allowing them to be involved in the broader school community. Parents are  also advised of the options available to their child by the teachers or the parent coordinator.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Supplemental materials used to support ELL learning include the use of internet in the classrooom, accessing vocabulary ,  grammar, reading, and pronunciation related websites; audio-visual presentations in the classroom , used in combination with  traditional text based approaches to target all learning modalities;  NYSESLAT Exam Preparation books; classroom libraries of  grade-level fiction and non-fiction books; content-specific textbooks, and library resources brought into the classroom to  enrich the learning experience. ENL classrooms also have audio-visual carts readily available for use to help enrich the learning  environment for ELL students.   All our classrooms have Smart boards which facilitate the delivery of instruction. Students are able to view videos and access  online materials. All our classrooms have computers with Internet access that students could use at various times. Students  access reading internet sites, listen to conversations, and use the computers to complete research projects. Our classrooms  also have listening centers where students have the opportunity to listen to books on tape or CD. This is especially beneficial to  our newcomers who need to work on their listening skills. All our classrooms have rich libraries of fiction and non-fiction  books, picture books, dictionaries, and bilingual dictionaries. Language and and grade- appropriate books and materials are  available to our ELLs. Math manipulatives are available to all students and are especially beneficial to our newcomers and SIFE  students so they can grasp the mathematical concepts better. We also have a computer lab that is accessible to our students  for research projects and use during their allocated Computer Lab time.    The ENL teacher and classroom teachers have all the above mentioned resources available to them including a SIFE library,  bilingual glossaries, and bilingual dictionaries. The ENL teacher in collaboration with classroom teachers also created a binder  of thematic units to be used with newcomers or SIFE students.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language use in encouraged in both formal and informal settings with our ENL population. Entering level students are  paired with " a buddy" , transitioning/expanding students  who contribute in supporting and translating with their native  languages. They also provide support to the newcomers as they adjust to the new school setting.  Teachers are encouraged to  let their students write answers in their home language which in turn are translated by our bilingual pedagogues.  Students are  taught to appreciate and celebrate their home cultures through a variety of multi-cultural projects.   We offer native language support to our ELLs by offering translation dictionaries/glossaries for use in class and during the the  state ELA and Math testing. We also have a bilingual paraprofessionals  who assists  ELL children who speak Spanish, Hindi,  Punjabi, and  Arabic.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs are given the same access to support services, regardless of age or grade level. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers  ensure that the instruction and resources correspond to ELL's ages and grade level. This includes  topics of interest, text  selections, and the opportunity that students can interact with age appropriate peers. Students are grouped by grade and are  serviced as mandated in CR Part 154. Classroom libraries contain a wide range of age- appropriate materials.  Also,  Common  Core curriculum that we have implemented is according to the students' grade level.  When appropriate instruction is  differentiated and materials are modified to meet the needs of learners.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Supplemental materials used to support ELL learning include the use of internet in the classrooom, accessing vocabulary ,  grammar, reading, and pronunciation related websites; audio-visual presentations in the classroom , used in combination with  traditional text based approaches to target all learning modalities;  NYSESLAT Exam Preparation books; classroom librariesof  grade-level fiction and non-fiction books; content-specific textbooks, and library resources brought into the classroom to  enrich the learning experience. ENL classrooms also have audio-visual carts readily available for use to help enrish the learning  environment for ELL students.   All our classrooms have Smart boards which facilitate the delivery of instruction. Students are able to view videos and access  online materials. All our classrooms have computers with Internet access that students could use at various times.

Our classrooms  also have listening centers where students have the opportunity to listen to books on tape or CD. This is especially beneficial to  our newcomers who need to work on their listening skills. All our classrooms have rich libraries of fiction and non-fiction  books, picture books, dictionaries, and bilingual dictionaries. Language and and grade- appropriate books and materials are  available to our ELLs. Math manipulatives are available to all students and are especially beneficial to our newcomers and SIFE  students so they can grasp the mathematical concepts better. We also have a computer lab that is accessible to our students  for research projects and use during their allocated Computer Lab time.    The ENL teacher and classroom teachers have all the above mentioned resources available to them including a SIFE library,  bilingual glossaries, and bilingual dictionaries. The ENL teacher in collaboration with classroom teachers also created a binder  of thematic units to be used with newcomers or SIFE students.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   As new families contact PS 56 before the beginning of the school year they are provided with a classroom supply list and a list  of upcoming events. The PS56 staff also has a conversation with the families explaining the policies and expectations. They are  also encouraged to contact the staff and ENL teacher in case of any questions. Throughout the school year the Parent  Coordinator and PS 56 staff reaches out to new ELL families to welcome them and facilitate an easier transition. Parents of  new ENLs are invited to ELL orientations and school orientations  where they receive information about the programs and our  school. New ELL students are paired up with a buddy (usually someone who speaks their native language) to facilitate an easier  transition into our school.                  17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We currently do not provide any language electives to ELLs.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development for all ELL staff, which consist of the ENL teacher and classroom teachers of ELLs, includes access to  ELL citywide or district workshops. Training on ELL identification, placement and instructional strategies is offered to content  area teachers, special education teachers, the office staff, and the parent coordinator. We will also be coordinating in house  professional development to all staff ( classroom teachers: general and special education, ENL teacher,  clusters,  paraprofessionals)  regarding teaching content to English Language Learners and literacy across the  curriculum.   Topics will include differentiated instruction for ELLs, effective literacy instruction, analyzing the language  demands of tasks, building a strong Tier I, connecting content and academic language. All teachers will also engage in grade  level meetings every week to analyze data to drive their instruction.   Additionally, ENL teacher will attend citywide and district meetings. She is enrolled in the Queens South Borough Field Support  Center ELL Instructional institute which will meet every month from October to June.    Professional development in the Common Core Learning Standards is done weekly for all teachers including ELL staff for the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         purpose of aligning our curriculum to CCLS. Standards are reflected as a rubric and utilized to measure the success of the  students along the continuum for all CCLS adjusting for ENL students according to their language proficiency. ELL staff attends  workshops offered by the district or Office of ELLs to deepen understanding of CCLS . Conferences that are Department of  Education generated are available to ELL staff upon request. Teachers will engage in professional learning during the above  mentioned sessions.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  At PS 56Q we emphasize college and career readiness. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers attend workshops to assist in  their handling of ELLs making the transition from elementary school level to middle school setting. In 5  th   grade the teacher  implement the use of binders to assist students who will be transitioning to middle school. All staff members including  secretaries and the parent coordinator are given training in periodic professional development seminars, held both on-site and  off-site throughout the year.  Staff members have also been offered the opportunity to attend a variety professional  development opportunities regarding ELL strategies pertaining to content specific classes.      PS 56Q will and has committed time, energy and resources to professional development activities. Our ENL teacher is in  constant contact with classroom teachers to help refine instructional strategies specifically related to ELL population.  Throughout the year all staff members will attend training led by qualified personnel  on-site and off-site.    Records of these  meetings will be kept in the main office. In the training all teachers of ELLs will be exposed to the following topics for the  school year:   * Differentiated Instruction  * Writing Strategies for ELLs  * Reading across subject areas  * Strategies to increase student achievement  As teachers work to plan collaboratively, we will continue to focus on professional development to improve students' reading  and writing skills. We will continue to use inquiry teams to become more knowledgeable on how to instruct ELLs and increase  their language proficiency skills through different instructional tasks.               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 56Q has several procedures in place to ensure that parents of ELLs understand the goals of the ENL program, the language  development progress and assessment results. Since we have designated time on Wednesday mornings to parent  meetings,  parents of ELLs have weekly opportunities to be involved in the school community/culture.  Teachers listen to  parents' concerns while also focusing on the strengths families bring to the community, such as language and culture.  In  addition, frequent communication is published, translated, and mailed about school policies, news, and events. The parent  coordinator facilitates the parent association, which meets monthly. The parent coordinator along with our teachers perform  workshops specifically tailored to ELL parents . Peer volunteers will be assigned to serve as Cooperative Learning Partners to  LEP students in the classroom. Bilingual paraprofessionals will be assigned as mandated to provide support in  guided/cooperative learning activities. Bilingual paraprofessionals will also provide translation and interpretation as  needed.  Parental involvement includes Parent Teacher Association meetings,  family activities, and content-specific parent  outreach programs that aim to involve parents in their children's education.   Question 2 Below: ENL teacher maintains records in her room on parent meeting. A log is maintained of phone call attempts  and messages to document parent outreach.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents of ELLs have the same opportunities as parents of other students to participate in parent association meetings, multi- cultural events, and content specific outreach workshops.  We encourage parents to participate in non-academic family events  to share the experience of family where language is not a barrier. We offer Multicultural Night,  Mom and Me, Dad and Me,  BINGO Night, the Dance Festival, and our Thanksgiving Feast. All families contribute, celebrate, and create lasting memories.   We also offer a free After school program for all families. This experience gives children a valuable opportunity to acquire new  language and cultural skills through play and conversation with peers. Parents of ELLs attending our after school program are  invited periodically to visit our classrooms.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Harry Eicher                                                                              School DBN: 27Q056  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

We conduct a survey for parents/guardians which includes written translation and oral interpretation needs. In  addition, we analyze the information pulled from Part III of the Home Language Survey. This past year the survey  concluded that a certain number of our parents/guardians needed written translation/oral interpretation  services. We will continue to collect data on our students' family needs to ease communication between PS56Q  and the community. Based on the information extrapolated from the HLIS during 2018-2019 school year, 10% of  our newcomer families requested communication in a language other than English.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
