This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our school mission distinguishes P.S. /M.S. 124 as an educational community where students, staff and parents  collaborate to create an educational institution providing a foundation for life-long learners. It is our goal to inculcate  all members of the school community with an understanding and acceptance of diversity, fostering individuality and  creativity where high expectations are the norm for all students, through differentiation of the Core Knowledge  Language Arts Curriculum (CKLA K-2), Expeditionary Learning (Grades 3-8) and through the implementation of  instructional strategies that maximize success for all students. Through ongoing data analysis coupled with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      individualized learning paths, students master their grade level Common Core Learning Standards in preparation for  college, careers and other meaningful post-secondary opportunities.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Osmond A. Church is an elementary-middle school with 1200 students from kindergarten through grade 8, located in  South Ozone Park, Queens. We are a universal Title 1 school. The current population is comprised of 21.91% Hispanic,  6.5% American Indian/or Alaskan Native, 46.83% Asian, 1.58% Pacific Islander, 19.50% Black, and 3.16% White. Boys  account for 52.33% of the students enrolled and girls account for 47.66%. The attendance rate to date is 95.3%.   As a school community, we reinforce these values daily with our school-wide affirmation:   “We will always treat each other as family. We will work together with our peers. We will follow all of the rules. We  will stay strong and persevere.” These values are evidenced by a school-wide culture of collaboration, social and  emotional support, and rigorous academic standards.   Curriculum Planning time on Mondays is used to review the curriculum and make adjustments based on teacher  assessment and student progress. In K-6, an additional common planning period has been built in to teacher  schedules so that teachers are able to regularly assess the effectiveness of the curricular units of study. In addition to  multiple common planning periods, grade level teacher teams meet on Tuesday afternoons, biweekly to engage in a  collaborative analysis of student work. School-wide protocols for the work are used across grades where student work  products are reviewed and analyzed. It is through this collaboration and analysis of student work that teachers  identify student misunderstandings and those instructional/learning gaps that may be impacting student learning and  growth. Once those gaps have been identified, the team collaboratively develops an action plan that includes  research-based strategies for addressing the gaps in student learning.   In addition to the grade level teacher team, our school's vertical team (which is led by the Middle School Assistant  Principal) meets weekly to analyze school data, identify gaps/trends in student learning and to identify those best  practices (across grades and subject areas) to address those deficits. As a result of our in-depth teacher team work,  we identified the need to implement specific structures in lessons that provide students with multiple opportunities  to engage in mathematical discourse and to show evidence of their thinking throughout a math lesson. The best  practices identified from the Vertical Team meetings are shared school-wide and further addressed at the grade level,  by grade specific leaders from the vertical team during our weekly bi-weekly teacher team meetings and curriculum  planning periods on Mondays and Tuesdays. This year, in response to our school wide data around mathematics and  through our participation and training in the Algebra for All Initiative, FSC professional learning opportunities in  mathematics and special education, across grades K-8 our teachers are incorporating inquiry-based learning within  the mathematics curriculum. Teachers not only learned about, and shared best practices around how to deepen  student understanding of mathematics concepts, but it also pushed teachers to think about ways to refine their  assessments around mathematics in order to address student's actual, rather than perceived instructional needs.    Our STEM program has been expanded beyond a science cluster program in the fifth and sixth grades to include an  after-school program for students in grades 4 through 8. This program is designed to increase student exposure to  science opportunities and to provide a forum for intra-school competition through Adelphi University. A mobile STEM  lab provided through a grant from the Queens Borough President’s Office contains resources for advanced  investigations using computer probes and a digital microscope. This STEM program not only deepened our students  understanding of science concepts, it also allowed our students to compete among other New York City and Long  Island schools in the Robotics competition. As a result, our students earned their place as finalists in the National  Robotics competition where they traveled to Kentucky for the competition.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      In an effort to build students' ability to communicate and discuss important issues, our school is involved in various  debate competitions in and out of the school. We have participated in district competitions and the New York City  Urban Debate League competition. Across all grades (K-8), every student participated in Student-led Conferences this  year.   Middle school students who meet the requirements for academic performance and service are inducted into the  National Junior Honor Society which organizes food, coat, and toy drives. Community partnerships with New Yorkers  for Parks, the Ronald McDonald House, and other agencies reinforce the school’s commitment sustain a culture of  shared responsibility, empathy, and tolerance. In an effort to educate our students and the school community about  the dangers of fire safety, we participate in the NYFD Fire Education Program this year which included our  participation in the “smoke house” activity. Additionally, this year, we broadened our work around social and  emotional learning to include the creation and implementation of programs such as Leader in Me, Restorative Circles,  GEM Girls, Girls on the Run and My Brother's Keeper. Our students are immersed in citizenship and stewardship  through our monthly walks focused on health and wellness as well as our commitment to charity. This year we  participated in collecting monetary donations for the citizens of Sudan through our Long Walk for Water initiative  along with collecting food for City Harvest & Hurricane Relief.    Last year, we became a part of the Chancellor’s Middle School College Access for All initiative which has allowed us to  continue the work we began in 2014 around preparing our students for higher education and college readiness. We  host annual College Day, annually, in an effort to promote College and Career Readiness across the school. During  College Day, current college students visit our school and speak to students about the importance of college.  Additionally, our teachers, students, parents and staff participate in school-wide college door decorating contest in  connection with College Day. Our students are not only exposed to a myriad of college and universities, but they also  learn about how these institutions can prepare them for their higher education goals. In addition to College Day, we  also hold Career Day, in which professionals across various fields come in to speak with our students. Students in  grades 7 and 8 visit colleges across New York City. As part of the Middle School College Access for All initiative, our 7th  graders engage in classroom workshops in which they discuss various aspects of college life and ways that they can  prepare now for college.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   About 12% of our student population are non-English (ENL) speakers and growing. This population is challenged with  limitations in Language Acquisition in English and across the content areas. In order to address this specific need, ENL- Certified teachers are provided with opportunities to participate in common planning sessions with general education  and content area teachers. ENL teachers also provide Professional Development around strategies that can be used  by their colleagues who work with non-English speaking students.   Our 2018 NYSESLAT scores demonstrate that 85 English Language Learners (ELLs) were tested and as a result, 20  students are commanding, 25 students are expanding, 20 students are transitioning, 15 students are emerging and 1  student is entering.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our 2018 state results in ELA and Mathematics demonstrate that we have made gains in both subject areas.  Compared to the 2017 data, we made an 8% gain in ELA and outperformed the district, city and state at 50.7% Levels  3 and 4. In Mathematics, we made a 10.5% gain when compared to the 2017 data and outperformed our district at  40.9% Levels 3 and 4.    A key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year continues to be our refinement of our pedagogical practices  (Rigorous Instruction) across all content areas. An additional area of focus this year will continue to be strengthening  our assessment practices to ensure that assessment is incorporated throughout the entire instructional period.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     According to the feedback that was received from the 2017 Quality Review, curriculum-aligned performance rubrics  are being used to help teachers gauge student understanding on academic tasks. Most teachers use the "glow and  grow" protocol to provide students with feedback around their next steps and during instruction and teachers check  for understanding during instruction.   However, it was also noted that although the glow and grow protocol is being used, the quality of the feedback and  specific strategies to assist students in the task are not consistently being used. Additionally, when asked, students are  not always able to articulate their next steps for improving their work products. Teachers are not consistently using  their assessment of student progress to make adjustments to their plans, units and/or curriculum.    In addition to the feedback received from the 2017 Quality Review, a review of the 2018 Advance data resulting from  this year's observation cycle, revealed that 80% of our teaching staff received Effective/Highly Effective Ratings in 3d.  Assessment. As a result, the priority need addressed in this goal is around refining our assessment practices to include  a closer look at individual student progress and mastery of learning tasks and objectives. This includes offering  professional development for teachers around creating rubrics, analyzing student work and providing actionable  feedback, This also includes strengthening the work of teacher and common planning teams so that protocols for  analyzing student work are incorporated along with protocols for revising instructional plans based on trends, data  and student work products.

The PS/MS 124 school community recognizes how a positive, safe and nurturing environment greatly impacts  students' Social and Emotional Learning in and outside the classroom. Our school emphasizes leadership, stewardship  and community service that is grounded in charity and the notion of "giving back". As was observed and noted in the  2016-2017 Quality Review, every month our entire school community will walk in support of a specific cause in an  effort to bring awareness to various health and social-emotional issues such as autism and bullying.    In the middle school, students read the book, "Long Walk to Water" to raise awareness to the water crisis in Sudan .  This year, we met our goal and raised enough money to build an additional well in Sudan. We have partnered with  organizations such as the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Autism Speaks, Child Mind Institute & Student Resilience to  promote a positive culture and social-emotional wellness for our students. This year, selected middle school girls  participated in the GEMS (Girls Empowerment Movement) and Girls on The Run which encourages positive self- images and physical activity for healthy living, Additionally we have, multiple building activities occur throughout the  year including fashion shows, health fairs, and a multi-cultural festival where our school community represents their  culture through fashion, food and music.    Student have been the catalyst to our work around building school culture as well. Some examples of this are our six  grade students who initiated a club to promote positive behavior across the school called the anti-bullying club (ABC)  where they conduct anti-bullying presentations across classes and participated in an anti-bullying poster campaign.  Students voice is is incorporated throughout the building nd can be seen/heard during morning announcements,  participation in activites (monitors, ushers, helpers), Teen Read Program & The Junior Honor Society. During lunch  periods, guidance counselors assign older students as monitors in classrooms to help teachers. In the 2016-2017  Quality Review Feedback, students reported that student council members listen to their ideas and suggestions  around what organizations and causes we support and fundraise for.   Structures such as advisory classes in grades six through eight, offer students training on Restorative Circles, a social- emotional support program. During the 2016-2017 Quality Review, teachers reported that the program allows them  to get to know their students better and shared examples of how they are now more able to be supportive in difficult  situations. Students shared that the advisory period gives them an opportunity to talk to others and help others  understand their problems as well as determine solutions for them. Last year (2017-2018) all teachers in grades K-2  were trained in The Leader in Me & The 7 Habits of Effective Students. In the upcoming year, all K-2 students will  learn about those 7 habits through classroom instruction, practice and song. Teachers will deliberately incorporate  these habits in their daily classroom routines in order to provide ongoing social & emotional support for our youngest  learners.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review as well as the 2016-2017 Quality Review feedback indicates strengths in  the area of School Culture (1.4). Specifically, that "The principal continues to emphasize a deeper understanding of  social and emotional learning for the adults and students this school year". Additionally, as noted in the 2016-2017  Quality Review Feedback, "On-grade and vertical professional collaborations provide a voice and promote the  achievement of school goals and the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards while strengthening  the instructional capacity of teachers" (4.2). Further, feedback and comments from the 2016-2017 Quality Review  further state, "The principal values professional learning. Teachers learn about school and principal expectations for  teaching and learning in three cycles during the course of the year. Trends viewed through the observation process  inform this work. Teachers have the opportunity to visit colleagues’ classrooms with a specific focus and to debrief  about their learning. Teachers now visit colleagues on their own for additional learning."      The priority areas that we will focus on in 2018-2019, were identified using the current year's Advance data (MOTP  Workbook) as well as the 2016-2017 Principal Performance Review feedback where 2.2 (Assessment) was identified  as an area of development noting the need to "Continue to develop teacher practices on providing age appropriate,  rubric based check lists and comments that will allow all students to identify their next learning steps for  improvement". Similarly, the 2016-2017 Quality Review feedback also noted that, " across classrooms, teachers use  rubrics that are aligned to the curricula and in-the-moment assessment practices such as checks for understanding  and self-assessment. Although the use of checks for understanding and rubrics are implemented, inconsistent  effective adjustments and limited feedback have yet to meet all student-learning needs" .       2017-218 school-wide Advance data was reviewed and analyzed. We identified 1e (Effective Planning) along with 3d  (Assessment) as areas for development. Although teachers are meeting and collaborating regularly around  curriculum, planning and instruction, assessment practices are not always embedded throughout lessons, thereby,  reducing or eliminating opportunities for students to receive meaningful and effective feedback that will push their  thinking, help them make their thinking visible or allow for the teacher to address any misconceptions that may  prevent them from meeting the established learning target. As a result, goals for these areas of improvement must  include continual teacher collaboration and planning across grades and within vertical teams in order to ensure that  lesson plans and units are coherent, standards-based, are inclusive of high-level and rigorous tasks that are scaffolded  and differentiated for the varying levels that exist within the classrooms. Finally, plans and units should encourage  high order thinking, evaluation and analysis and include multiple opportunities for assessment.

"The principal along, with input from a variety of constituents, have developed data driven CEP goals and action plans  aligned to the instructional focus to accelerate student achievement. The principal continuously monitors the  progress towards the CEP and instructional goals to ensure the focus is directly aligned to student achievement  towards meeting proficiency.".       Additionally, during the 2017-2018 Principal Performance Observation (PPO) review, Domains 3.4 and 4.2 received a  Well Developed rating:   "The principal has clearly defined standards for professional learning and classroom practices to ensure that learning  for all stakeholders consistently reflects her high expectations. The principal has established high expectations for all  staff, which is evidenced throughout the school community through verbal and written structures housed in the Staff  Handbook, daily weekly communications which emulates a culture where accountability is reciprocal between all  constituents. The school provides ongoing verbal and written communications with families to deepen their  understanding of the expectations for their children and offer them ways to support their children in meeting these  expectations."   "The principal has created a culture for teachers to meet and share their talents and best practices through teams,  professional learning and inter-visitations. Teacher teams provide data based rationale and analysis of student work  that inform their decisions to adjust practice and create goals for groups of students. The vertical team serves as a  conduit for teacher input in strategic decisions that affect the overall improvement of teaching and learning."

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The PS/MS 124 teaching staff is 100% highly qualified as indicated in the BEDS survey. Through networking conducted  by the Administrative Team qualified pedagogues are hired if a vacancy is declared. To ensure that we hire highly  qualified teachers that are competent in their pedagogy, the leadership team has collaboratively designed a rubric  used during the hiring process. Candidates are screened using a rigorous hiring process which includes an-in-depth  interview in which candidates must demonstrate their knowledge of the Common Core Standards and the attributes  of a highly effective teacher according to the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Leadership team attends city-wide  hiring hall as well as collaborates with Queens College’s Education Department, seeking future educators for our  school.    The highly qualified staff holds licenses in: Early Childhood, Common Branch, Gifted and Talented, English, Math,  Social Studies, General Science, Life Science, Social Work, Psychology, Speech, Occupational Therapy, Physical  Therapy, Special Education, Physical Education and Administration.   Highly qualified teachers are maintained through providing opportunities under the umbrella of distributive  leadership. E.g.   ● Grade leaders   ● Team Leaders   ● Opportunities to participate in the STEM Teacher-Led Team   ● New teacher team meetings   ● Peer mentoring   ● Inter-visitation and feedback   Opportunities for rich, collaborative dialogue regarding school-based decisions via the Principal’s open door policy.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36         In the event a teacher is not Highly Qualified, the secretary will work closely with the HR person to ensure that the  non Highly Qualified person meets all required documentation and assessment deadlines.        2b.

Parents are invited in the beginning of the school year to  meet the teacher and view the classroom; additional support is provided as needed .        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The administration meets with a committee of teachers (MOSL committee) to discuss assessment options. The  Professional Development Committee makes decisions regarding the implementation of programs and assessments  throughout the school year. The school provides professional development for staff on how to use these results and  data to improve instruction        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   X         X        X   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Sections (5-7)     Sections (5-7)     Sections (5-7)        Sections (5-7)         Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 124Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Services are provided during the school day will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, PS/MS 124Q uses various tools.  First, we look at any NYSITELL or  NYSESLAT data to determine students' levels in the 4 modalities.  We also assess using the Dolsch sight word lists, letter  recognition charts, number charts, quick writes, basic vocabulary exercises, etc.    In addition, we use the I-Ready program in  ELA and math.  This program is aligned to CCLS standards and differentiates lessons for the needs of each individual  student.  Students work on I-Ready in their classrooms multiple times each week and they can access the program at home as  well.   Teachers can monitor student progress through this program.  If teachers find that students are having difficulty in  mastering a specific skill or strategy,  we differentiate lessons to target that need.  We use Fountas and Pinnell to assess the  students' reading levels three times a year.  Based on the results of all of these assessments, we develop lessons and activities  to help them improve their reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.  We are constantly assessing students informally and  formally to make sure they are actively engaged and showing improvement.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   1. Only ENL certified teachers administer the NYSITELL to new admits/non-English speaking students  2. Teachers are equipped with the proper resources to conduct initial assessments  3. Every student has access to a laptop at a minimum of 2 times a week in order to access and utilize I-Ready in Reading and  Mathematics  4. Fountas and Pinnell readding assessment tool kits are available to teachers in graded K-5 and are administered three times a  year  5. Teachers are provided with professional development related to various methods of assessment and differentiating  instruction     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our ENL program is evaluated both objectively and subjectively.  First, we look to see how our students moved  on the NYSESLAT.  We further extrapolate that data by comparing modalities from year to year.  In addition, we look to see if  our students met their AMAO and what percentage did so.  For students eligible to take state tests, we look to see how our  ELLs performed.  We also look to our FELLs to ensure that they are improving in both state ELA and math exams, as well as  other state exams.  In addition, we evaluate individual student growth by assessing the level of involvement in the classroom,  the behaviors, adjustment to school expectations and overall ability to thrive.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    ENL teachers' schedules are strategically designed where they have opportunities to collaborate with classroom teachers and  content area teachers on an ongoing basis. Based on students' performance level and/or linguistic needs, appropriate  intervention strategies are discussed and implemented to meet the needs of all students. Teachers, including ENL teacher, are  continuously anal zing summative assessment form State Exams and Unit Exams in order to differentiate instruction based on  the data.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ELLs are exposed and participate in the core curriculum regularly. Various assessment tools, such as Fountis and Pinell and  I-Ready, provide concrete data to drive instruction. While core instruction (Tier I) serves 80% of students' needs, others will  need extra attentions and more scaffolding (Tier II). Tier II is instruction that is driven to serve about 15% of students where  lessons are differentiated to meet the needs of our ELLs. Additionally, some students might need intensive instruction (Tier III)  where instruction has to be individualized such as small groups or 1:1. Generally, about 5% of students fall under the Tier III  category.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our current data reveals a higher concentration of entering and emerging students in second through 5  th   grades.  By middle  school, most students are at the expanding or commanding levels.  Most students who are eligible for the NYSITELL are testing  at an entering or emerging level.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   1. When creating our table of organization, we ensure that two classes per grade will contain ELLs.  2. Once the NYSESLAT data is available, we analyze the data based on the RLAT report to identify the ELLs and FELLs  3. When creating the ENL teachers' schedules, we are strategic about maximizing each teacher's schedule to ensure that our  ELLs and FELLs are receiving their mandated minutes as per Part-154.          Part IV: ELL Programming    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At PS/MS 124Q we currently only have a freestanding ENL program.  Students who are at transitional level and above  receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL in their mainstream classrooms.  Students who are entering and emerging  receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL as well as 180 minutes of stand alone ENL in small groups outside of the  mainstream classroom.  Children are grouped by grade (no more than 2 contiguous grades) and proficiency level for  small group instruction.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Currently, through careful programming and utilization of the certified ENL teachers in our school, we maximize our time  so that all ELLs and FELLs are receiving their instructional minutes according to their proficiency levels. Our Entering/Emerging  students receive 360 minutes on ENL instruction with 180 minutes in standalone and 180 minutes in integrated ELA. Our  Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction with 90 minutes in standalone and 90 minutes  in integrated  ELA. Our Advanced students also receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction integrated with ELA/content area. Lastly, our  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction integrated with ELA/content area.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       In the integrated portion of our ENL program, core content is delivered in the general education classroom with facilitation  by the ENL teacher.  Curriculum is enhanced by charts, illustrations, picture dictionaries, and hands-on activities to support  comprehension.  Students are paired with other students who speak the same home language to complete classroom  activities.  In the stand-alone ENL portion of our program, we pull out small groups of ELLs and focus on skills and strategies  that align with the Common Core.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Currently, our Spanish-speaking ELLs have "Go Math" books and workbooks in Spanish.  They are evaluated in Spanish on  classroom assignments as well as quizzes and tests.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For newcomers, ENL teachers deliver integrated and stand-alone instruction throughout the day.  In the integrated program,  ENL teachers work with students in the classroom.  ENL teachers provide explicit  instruction based on the Common Core  curriculum.  We provide sentence starters, graphic organizers, vocabulary building activities, and we provide materials and  tasks that have been customized to meet the needs of the students and the Common Core goals.  In the stand alone program,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      ENL teachers work with ELLs in small groups.  ENL teachers focus on their needs based on their proficiency level and what we  see in the classroom.    For developing students, ENL teachers focus more on writing skills and strategies based on the Common Core curriculum. ENL  teachers use graphic organizers and teach outlining and note taking techniques to help them be successful in their writing.  We  also focus on reading skills and strategies such as inferring, close reading techniques, supporting ideas with evidence from the  text, etc.  After observing and conferring with students and classroom teachers, ENL teachers design materials and mini  lessons that will support students acquisition of skills.  Currently PS/MS 124Q has two long-term ELLs.  Both students have IEPs and receive SETSS.  For these students, teachers tailor  their instructional goals to the IEP goals.  We focus mostly on reading and writing as these are their lowest scoring modalities  on the NYSESLAT and also where they are struggling most in their classes.  For students who are former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status, we work with students for 90 minutes a week in the  classroom.  ENL teachers focus on student needs based on conferences with students and teachers.  Writing is the modality  that the students have the most difficulty with so we tend to focus on building grammar skills as well as using higher level  vocabulary in writing.  We also work on higher level reading strategies that are aligned with common core such as close  reading.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Teachers of ELL-SWDs use a variety of instructional strategies and techniques to provide access to academic content and  accelerate English language development.  Teachers model all strategies that students need to do multiple times before asking  students to work in pairs or independently.  Teachers increase response opportunities, allow for repetition and skill practice,  and reduce the number of skills and concepts being taught at one time.  Repetitive reading of material is also used to practice  different strategies and skills.  Teachers focus on vocabulary development as well.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teachers use all of the strategies above to help students meet their IEP goals.  Students work in small groups within the  classroom or out of the classroom where teachers reteach skills and strategies that students are struggling with and focus on  1-2 concepts at a time.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer a variety of programs to target our ELLs.  1. AIS (Academic Intervention Services) - Classes are comprised of small groups and target all four modalities using the READY  program.  Classes are taught in English twice a week.  2. Saturday ELL Academy - Classes are comprised of small groups based on proficiency level and grade and target all four  modalities using the Finish Line series by Continental Press.  Classes are taught in English.    3. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) Club - Classes are comprised of students who are interested in  STEM.  Classes are taught in English twice a week.  4.  SAYA (South Asian Youth Action) - Students in SAYA receive help with their homework and projects.  Students are placed in  classes with teachers who speak the same home language whenever possible.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our focus for the upcoming school year is to improve/enhance the implementation of CR Part 154 for ELLs.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs/services will be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      ELLs participate in AIS programs after school and in an ELL Academy on Saturdays.  Students are grouped by English language  needs so that the teachers can plan lessons specifically designed to target language goals.  Entering and emerging students  focus on phonemic awareness, sight vocabulary and basic writing structures.  Higher- level students focus on reading strategies  and the development of more complex writing skills.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   PS/MS 124 Q uses technology to support ELLs.  Students access websites such as Starfall, Moby Max, iReady and Brainpop in  school and at home.  We immerse students into the Expeditionary Learning curriculum for ELA and we use the Go Math  curriculum for math classes which has materials in Spanish as well as English.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Initially, in our ENL program, we encourage students to write in their home language if they can with visuals to show what they  are writing about.  Entering ELLs are partnered with students who speak the same language so that they can support the new  students.  ELLs are also provided dictionaries in their own languages as well as content area glossaries.  Whenever available,  content area books are provided in the home language and quizzes are given in the home language as well.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At PS/MS 124Q resources and programs are carefully matched to students' age and grade level.  By evaluating an ELL student's  proficiency level through a variety of tools (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, reading and speaking assessments, iReady, etc.) we are able  to evaluate all ELLs strengths and weaknesses.   Based on our findings, we acquire, either through our own library or purchase  if necessary, the most appropriate materials for students.  We attempt to stay current with the latest programs and technology  that is constantly being developed to meet the needs of our ELLs.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share the building with any other school     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   If an ELL student is enrolled before the beginning of the school year or throughout the school year, the student is provided  with the opportunity to visit the school for a tour. If summer school is in session, the ELL student can sit in a class and observe  the quality of instruction. The ENL coordinator and ENL teachers provide workshops to ELLs and their parents in order to  educate them about the types of programs that we have available. In addition, our ELLs meet their ENL teachers during the  initial process as they have the expertise to assess and provide valuable information to the ELLs and their parents.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    In middle school, our ELLs are given the opportunity to study Spanish.  They also take technology, music and art classes in  English.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    All staff receives PD in strategies to help ELLs in a variety of situations and classrooms.  Our professional development  endeavors to address the needs of ELLs as well as other special needs students while addressing new curriculum and goals for  achievement based on the common core standards.  PDs are given in grade-level groups on Monday afternoons during  extended time.   PS/MS 124 provides Professional Development sessions that target different grades, subject areas, and proficiency levels.  Some sessions will be conducted by exemplary staff in the school and other sessions will be held at various institutions which  will target teachers of ELLs' needs.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  -Provide PD to middle school teachers related to ENL models in high school.   -Schedule visitations for middle school teachers to visit local high schools. This way, teachers will be able to provide specific  and detailed information regarding our ELLs placement s in high school. In addition, the teachers will learn about specific ENL  models to better assist our ELLs make the transition from middle school to high school.  As we continue to plan this year's professional development sessions, we will ensure that all teachers will accumulate 15% of  their PD hours in ELL-specific topics and our ENL teachers will accumulate 50% of their PD hours in ELL-specific topics. Some of  the sessions will be conducted by experienced exemplary staff, other will be delivered by outside professionals and at times,  teachers will be sent to attend PD workshops in order to meet the CR Part 154.2 requirements.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    The ENL teachers schedule annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs on Tuesday afternoons during extended  time.  During these meetings, we discuss goals for students, language development progress, assessment results, and language  development needs in different content areas.  We ensure that there is a translator available if needed.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   PS/MS 124 is dedicated to increasing parent involvement of our ELL students.  The administrative team, the Parent  Coordinator and the ENL teachers are active in promoting parent involvement.  The ENL teachers provide workshops for ELL  parents once a month on Saturday mornings to address needs and concerns.  Workshops address upcoming assessments and  tests, library skills, homework skills, supporting English language acquisition at home, etc.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maritza Williams Jones, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Osmond A.
