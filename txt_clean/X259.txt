This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our Mission Statement is below:   Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of HERO High springs from the commitment of the partners, The City University of New York, Hostos  Community College, Montefiore Medical Center and school staff to furthering social mobility for their students and  the South Bronx community. To this end, we will work together to build a new kind of institution so that the  transformation of adolescence may culminate in professional employment within the field of healthcare. Students will  gain a rigorous liberal arts education emphasizing literacy across the curriculum, accelerated math and science, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      work-based learning, and a supported entry to college and work through our Associate degree options in nursing and  community health. Students will learn to meet the public health challenges of a changing world by working with  others to address the needs of their own communities. We pledge to personalize academic and social support so that  every student reaches his or her potential and discerns his or her calling for professional work. Graduates of HERO  High will act as leaders in their chosen professions, transforming healthcare delivery systems in ways that improve the  well-being of diverse communities in the Bronx and around the world.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Health, Education and Research Occupations High School, or HERO High, is a new, 9-14, early college, Career and  Technical Education (CTE) high school in its sixth year of operations. Through our partnerships with the City University  of New York (CUNY) Early College Initiative, Hostos Community College and Montefiore Medical Center, we are  dedicated to helping our diverse student body achieve high school and college graduation and supported entry to in- demand careers in health care.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   HERO High serves a diverse groups of students that includes many special populations, including: advanced students  who have taken multiple Regents courses before entering high school; special education students; English language  learners; Title 1 students; students in temporary housing; students who have been impacted by the criminal justice  system; students with social/emotional needs not identified on an IEP; students performing in the lowest third on  state exams in middle school. HERO High provides comprehensive academic, health and social/emotional supports so  that our students are able to excel academically and succeed in high school. early college classes, rigorous college  degrees in STEM fields and demanding careers. These supports include individual and group counseling, supports for  positive behavior led by staff members skilled in youth development, collaborative problem solving, restorative  justice and crisis intervention, academic support in every subject during the school day and after school, a variety of  clubs and sport teams, choice in arts classes, academic advisement, community building circles and student-led  assemblies. These supports are coordinated through an intensive advisory program in which students stay with the  same advisor throughout their four years of high school.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2017-18 was our fifth year of operations and one of many successes for HERO High. We greatly increased our  college readiness rate so that almost 75% of graduates and almost 50% of the cohort were college ready in math  and English by graduation. At the same time, many years of effort and productive teacher team work around  instruction were recognized during an end-of-year Quality Review when we were rated “well-developed” in most  categories. Interdisciplinary projects were more challenging and truly interdisciplinary this year, due to the  continued work of grade teams. Other teacher team accomplishments include continued progress on vertical and  horizontal planning as key pieces of academic and personal advisement for students. Improvements in school  culture were made through the addition of two family events - a holiday party and an end-of-year carnival  celebrating newly college-ready students - as well as a hugely popular student/staff basketball game. The student  leadership class convened younger students and implemented an anti-bullying initiative through a student film and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      student-led discussions in advisory. Finally, the summer was also a successful one as almost 150 students were  placed into paid internships through the new school-based option of SYEP.    For our sixth year, we plan to continue our efforts to make our academic program more challenging and our school  culture more positive, supportive and focused. Our school-wide focus this year will be practicing the HERO value of  “hope” by helping students to support each other in persisting through challenging academic work, especially at  the college, recognizing opportunities, especially ones that are a result of our unique school model, and acting  strategically to take advantage of these opportunities. On the academic side, we plan to increase the cognitive  demand of tasks by improving unit plans and strengthening student tasks, and further independent learning habits  through strengthening feedback procedures and homework routines. On the school culture side, we plan to make  school culture more positive by increasing opportunities for student voice and leadership through student  government and student-led assemblies. We will add more positive school events like homecoming and incentive  trips. We will address chronic issues like student lateness through the addition of restorative consequences such as  after-school academic restoration. We will improve support for advisory through regular meetings with social  workers and the college team, regular training in high school, college and career advisement, and the provision of  curricular materials and instructional support.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. HERO High, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       HERO High will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

We offer individual after-school tutoring to newcomer,  entering and emerging ELL's through our partnership with Hunter College.  Rationale: Because our beginner ELL's take content-heavy courses at HERO, they require  individual academic support with the reading and material. Students who have managed a school  day in a new language struggle with stamina.  The opportunity to work one-on-one with a  slightly older mentor engages students and increases attendance and persistence at these sessions.  Staffing: Our 3 full-time ESL teachers lead these sessions.  They are able to provide materials  and direction for the tutoring pairs, as they co-teach the language-heavy courses for beginning  and intermediate ELL's.  Schedule and duration: Twice a week for an hour after school from September to June. (72 hours  of per session for 2 hours per week for 38 weeks. Each session is covered by one teacher;  following per session procedures hours hours are covered by seniority when multiple  ESL teachers apply.) All funds are used for direct supplemental instruction.  Language of Instruction: English  Materials: Content-aligned materials provided by ESL teachers, such as bilingual  dictionaries, cloze exercises, modified readings, and translated materials.  Targeted students: Emerging ELL's (5 students) and Transitioning ELL's (7 students).      Saturday Academy (grades 9-12). ELL's are encouraged to attend Saturday Academy with their  content area and ESL teachers.  Rationale: Students benefit from additional small-group support from their teachers  Staffing: 5-8 content certified teachers + 1 ENL teacher  Schedule and duration: 3 hours a week from 9am-12 noon, on 4 Saturdays first semester and 8  Saturdays second semester..  Language of Instruction: English  Materials: Content-aligned materials provided by content, such as bilingual dictionaries, cloze  exercises, modified readings, and translated materials.

Teachers  benefit from weekly dedicated time to plan instruction and assess and plan individual students  and groups of students.  This time also served to develop the push-in ESL teacher's content  expertise and the content area teacher's skills at adapting curriculum to accommodate ELL's.  Schedule and duration: 1-2 periods per week for each teaching partnership (Monday to Friday  during teacher circular 6 time, which varies according to teacher schedule).Topics to be covered:  differentiation to support access to content for English language learners and development and  support of language acquisition goals.  There is no outside provider contracted to support this PD.  School Administration and affinity  group coaches provide in school support, and the ESL lead teacher attends affinity group  instructional conferences on facilitating common planning time to build the team's capacity.  This is at no cost to Title III, since all Title III funds are used for direct supplemental instruction.       Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Rationale: Frequent communication with a trusted adult empowers parents who might feel  intimidated to interact with an unfamiliar school system. Where possible, we match students with  advisors who speak the students' home language, and where that is not possible, advisors use  translation services.  The frequency of this contact enables the advisor and family to overcome  any intimidation or logistical challenges.  Topics: Student progress and upcoming school events  Advisors reach out by phone to the 15 students on their caseload on a weekly basis, and  document contact in Skedula.  There is no external provider.   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.  Ensure that your  Title III budget matches your Title III Plan.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Because HERO is an early college high school, we align our assessments for ELLs to the English curriculum, thus preparing them  for the college English classes they will start taking in 11th grade.  The ESL teacher (who is also certified in English 7-12 and has  a Ph.D. in English) is an integral part of the planning team for the English curriculum.  Our ELLs are assessed through individual  conferences; periodic formative and summative reading and writing assessments that are aligned with the Common Core  Standards and include appropriate ELL scaffolds. In particular, to make instructional and placement decisions, we look at the  MOSL and a teacher-created writing diagnostic.  Our 9        th       grade has the highest number of ELLs who require support in listening comprehension.  In all grades, students  score lowest on reading comprehension and writing.  Analysis of last year's formative assessments reflects that ELLs show  particular progress in writing fluency and organization.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      We use the data to inform our instructional plan both through developing our offerings and hand-programming students.  We  offer ELL support in our most reading and writing rich content classes. We hand-programmed students for single or multiple  content classes depending on where we had seen them requiring support.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the effectiveness of our programs for ELLs primarily on their persistance and success in academic classes.    We set as a target that students will pass at least 11 credits per year, in addition to the required regents.  We have noted that  meet the credit accumlation benchmark more freuqently than the Regents benchmark, and have implemented some  strategies across classes (such as reader's apprenticeship metacognitive strategies for independent reading comprehension),  as well as special programs (the PERC rogram) for students who struggle on Regents exams.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   n/a        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   More than half of our ELLs placed out of ESL on the NYSELAT in the Spring:  5 (out of 9) 9th graders and 6 (out of 11) 10th  graders passed the NYSESLAT.  Our students' reading and writing lags behind their speaking and listening.  We have not had students that requred the NYSITELL.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We offer separate, relatively homogeneous, stand alone ENL classes for 9        th       and 10        th       graders for  students.  9        th       graders were initally programmed for the ENL class based on their entering or emerging  NYESLAT scores.  In the first few weeks of school, ELLs who were in mainstream English based on advancedwere  monitored, and some were transferred into ENL when assessment of their participation and work indicated that more  support would be helpful.  ELLs are also programmed for integrated ENL support in science, health, and history  classes, which are heterogeneous.  All 11        th       grade students are in maintream English with integrated ENL  support.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 9        th       grade:    Entering, emerging: 400 minutes stand-alone ENL; 200 minutes push-in ESL support in health; 200 minutes push in ESL  support in science (9        th       grade students do not take history at HERO).

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   3. Our program model comprises stand-alone ESL classes as well as push-in to content classes, and common planning  across the curriculum.   ESL teachers have common planning time with the English department.  they offer a modified version of the grade-level  English curriculum, with scaffolds to support English language learners and additional language acquisition strategies.     ESL instruction is delivered in English. In the content areas, the teachers have common planning time with each co-teacher,  and work and plan with her co-teacher and adapts the lesson given so that it is more accessible to the ESL students.  They  scaffold the instruction, makes modifications where needed to accommodate the student's level, she will explain the  vocabulary (front loading), modify the pacing and suggest strategies to successfully complete assignments. The focus is on  literacy as well as language acquisition skills. Differentiation is a critical component for content area instruction, not only in the  English class but in mathematics, social studies, and science. Again, scaffolding, pacing, instructional modifications and  vocabulary play a key role in rolling out new concepts and most particularly in word problems. Additional strategies are:   ---note taking from a supplementary text, using the Cornell model for note taking,   ---summarizing and strengthening academic language in the content areas,   ---paraphrasing when writing paragraphs and cloze exercises.   our 9        th       grade ELLs are programming in math and science classes in the PERC model, where peer tutors (Teaching  assistant scholars) who has taken the class before support groups of students.  ELLs are programmed in PERC classes with  Teaching Assdistant Scholars who can translate into their home languages.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                      If the student is a first entrant to NYC they are eligble to take the LAB-R. If the home language is Spanish he/she will  also take the Spanish LAB. Students are tested annually with the NYSESLAT to measure growth. For students who are literate in  their native language, they can take the  NYS Regents Examinations in their native language or use the native language version  side by side with the english version and those exams can be graded by teachers proficient in those languages.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6a. SIFE students come with missed years of official school instruction. As a result, they are often illiterate in their home  language   as well as in English. These students must learn English, pass their classes and pass the NYS regents’ exams. In order to  address   their academic needs we offer them tutoring, online programs for credit recovery, reading programs for literacy, and   counseling. In addition, we select for them age and interest appropriate materials. They are older and need more social and   emotional interventions to keep them in school in order to graduate high school. In addition our SIFE students will be provided  with   the appropriate testing modifications for ELL students. These students are all assigned a counselor and an advisor to support  academic behaviors. Within content classes, teachers plan supports with the ESL teacher and the ICT special education  teacher. We have found that differentiation strategies that are effective with our ICT students are also effective with  SIFE.  Individual support is provided in after-school and Saturday tutoring. One of our ESL teachers Mr Sorensen has a  background in social services, and provides additional socio-emotional support to our SIFE students.     6b. Newcomer ELLs are provided after school tutoring through a partnership with Hunter College. Where possible, newcomer  ELLs are matched with advisors who speak their home languages, to provide academic counseling in home language and family  contact without a translator.     6c. Developing ELL students are provided with intensive literacy support.      6d. Long Term ELL students are provided with additional literacy support in a small setting with our Wilson-trained special  education tecaher.     6e. Former ELLs are provided with push-in support in at least one content class, and their progress is monitored by the ESL  coordinator. They still get extended time on class and state exams, for two years and the use of dictionaries and glossaries and  tutoring. Former ELLs are provided the appropriate testing modifications. They are also supported via counseling, after school  groups, tutoring and mentoring.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers make extensive use of SIOP practices, including visuals, graphic organizers, translations, access to bilingual and  English dictionaries, access to online translation programs, Spanish Algebra and Living Environment textbooks and translations  of the curricular texts used in English, and are assisted by teaching assistant scholars who can translate materials to students'  home langauges, vocabulary building (including word walls), peer review, think/write/pair/share, double-entry journals, videos  with Spanish subtitles,  book recordings.  Students with higher language needs (newcomers, SIFE) are paired up with more  advanced students.  ELLs in all subgroups complete projects throughout the year, including an interdisciplinary project in  health careers that involves all content areas.  They all participate in the mandatory fieldtrips to our partner institutions,  Hostos Community College and Montefiore Hospital.  Former ELLs continue to receive testing accommodations for up to two  years, and push-in supportin at least one content class.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    We have at least one ICT section for all core classes, stand-alone SETSS, and far more possible instructional minutes of ESL  than mandated on each grade level, and individually program stduents to meet their needs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Wilson reading for ELLs with low literacy in English, particularly when they also have low L1 literacy.  After school tutoring for newcomer ELLs and other entering and emerging ELLs, through our partnership with Hunter College.  Small group academic intervention for SIFE students and ELL-SWDs.  ICT support for SIFE students and ELL-SWDs.  Push-in academic support in our literacy-heavy health classes by special education teachers.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We have partnered with the CUNY PERC program, where students have the opportunity to serve as teaching assistant scholars  in classes they have marginally passed.  We focussed on recruiting ELL's for this opportunity.  It enables students who passed  the class but did not pass the Regents to master the content more fully.  It also enables students to develop their academic  language in L1, as they tutor students with their same home language.  It also enables students taking the class for the first  time to have L1 support.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   In prior years, we had a cohort of ELLs in each grade who received push-in support in all content areas.  An unintended  consequence of this model is that ESL students were together for most of the day, and were not interacting as much with non- ELL's.  Our new program allows students to be programmed more flexibly, so they have more choice in electives, and more  access to special ed services.  The PERC program enables beginner ELLs in 9        th       grade to get L1 support in classes that  are not ESL classes.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We offer tutoring, extracurricular activities, PSAL sports, and Saturday tutoring to all students.  Weekly contact from student  advisors, and phone calls from the main office in home langauges ensure that ELLs are aware of these opportunities.  Our ELLs  participate in afetr-school at a higher rate than non-ELLs.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ELA classes have classroom libraries with a variety of genres, and we will get more books in the native languages, spoken  by our ELL populations. Bilingual dictionaries are available. We incorporate technology into the curriculum, with research and  writing taking place on computers where students have access to translation servicse and home language materials.   as a  blended learning learning environment that combines face to face instruction with online curriculum. the majority of our  curriculum is teacher-created and aligned to common core. We have regular common-planning time in which all curriculum is  coplanned by content teachers, special education teachers and ESL specialists. Students have access to bilingual  dictionaries.  The NorthStar ESL textbook series is used to supplement the curriculum.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language arts is offered in 11        th       grade.  Students in the teaching assistant scholar program prepare to tutor classes in their home languages.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ESL instruction is tailored to our mission as an early-college school.  HERO also has a strong advisory program where students  have the daily opportunity to work and interact with each other in a smaller and more informal group setting.

If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The ELA classes have classroom libraries with a variety of genres, and we will get more books in the native languages, spoken  by our ELL populations. Bilingual dictionaries are available. We incorporate technology into the curriculum, with research and  writing taking place on computers where students have access to translation servicse and home language materials.   as a  blended learning learning environment that combines face to face instruction with online curriculum. the majority of our  curriculum is teacher-created and aligned to common core.

Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Over the summer, we offer an orientation to new students with teachers, administration and older students. When new  students arrive during the year, they are connected with an advisor who supports their transition to the school.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Native language arts are offered to Spanish speakers.  We also offer an honors elective in humanities.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Content teachers have weekly common planning time with the ESL teachers who push-in to their classes, as well as weekly  department meetings.  Teachers get five days of Readers Apprenticeship training through West Ed.     Our weekly professional development follows six-week cycle where   Week 1: Learn, practice and plan around the cognitive strategy for the marking period.  Week 2: Advisory data check  Week 3: Teacher volunteers for tuning protocol around recent efforts using this strategy in instruction.  Week 4: Learn, practice and plan around the cognitive strategy for the marking period. This cycle may differentiate for  different teacher needs.  Week 5: Teacher volunteers for tuning protocol around recent efforts using this strategy in instruction.  Week 6: Advisory data check.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  9        th       graders have advisory class every day (twice as much as other students).  We have a ninth grade advisory lead and  a 9        th       grade social worker, who support the 9        th       grade advisors through shared curriculum, push-in modeling,  kid talk, and biweekly advisory professional developments.  In addition, advisors have the funded opportunity to attend  restorative circles training.   West Ed's Reader's Apprenticeship disciplinary literacy approach, which drives our academic professional development, is a  research-tested model shown to improve English language learners language skills and access to content.  It drives 80 minutes  every two weeks of professional development.  Agendas and attendance are tracked through google docs.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Advisors schedule student-led academic conferences with students and their families. Where possible, advisors are assigned  who speak the students' home language, and staff members are scheduled to join.  Preparation for the conference is done  with the students' content and ESL teachers.  The outreach is tracked in skedula, and the conference dates are tracked through  or google for educators.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Paste response to questions here: Parents are informed through letters, flyers, and phone calls.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kristin Cahill Garcia, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Several members of our staff (the social worker, guidance counselor, early college liaison, community associate,  school aide, and math teacher) are fully bilingual in Spanish; therefore, any parent that needs interpretation and  translation can easily obtain it . We have also started using online translation programs to translate the letters,  flyers and documents that are sent home. Bilingual staff is present at all the meetings with parents to ensure  adequate interpretation.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59   Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral             Language    Based on the home  language survey, ATS  information and  information obtained  during orientation, the  school determined that  the two languages  students need  information sent home  in were Spanish and  English.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.

Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       School staff provides all translations  in-house and all documents will be  translated before they are sent to the  student's home. DOE forms and  letters (such as permission slips or ESL  services continuation letters) will be  duplicated from the DOE website. All  documents that are addressed to  parents will be shared with a bilingual  staff member, who will provide a  translation before they are sent to the  parents.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to   School staff (as described above)  provide all oral interpretation  services.               provide interpretation service(s)?       3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The school will follow all mandated guidelines as prescribed in Chancellor's Regulation A-663. Specifically, the school  will provide immediate services; or within 10 days of a new student enrolling into the school, we will provide the  Parent/Guardian Home Language Identification survey and video. In addition, during school meetings or conferences,  all bilingual families will receive translated materials such as the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. In addition,  the main office has a poster with information stating translation and interpretation services available to them.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive.
