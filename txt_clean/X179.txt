This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview         Mission    Our mission is to provide a supportive community for learning that emphasizes a thinking curriculum; a standards- based instructional program, supported by concerned parents and dedicated teachers, in a safe environment that  provides the academic, social, and creative skills needed to prepare our students for success in a technologically   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      oriented society. The school must focus on results and students must aim for mastery. The school must reward  student success and remedy student failure. Parents and community are integral partners with teachers in the  education of children.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   In order to attain our vision and mission we have partnered with several key organizations that align themselves with  our goals. We collaborate with many different partners in order to ensure that all of our students’ needs are met.    We partner with the United Way of New York City in their READNYC initative. ReadNYC is focused on literacy  improvement and two generational success in Mott Haven. This partnership provides support for teachers,  instructional leaders, students and parents to ensure that all stake holders in the community are a part of the  learning. This ensures that they have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of  respect and continuous improvement. When the instructional leaders model the importance of learning then this  demonstrates the philosophy of " Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and  staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement."    Specifically, this partnership involves expanded day programming in the summer and during the school year, the  implementation of I Read to support K-2 students foundational literacy development and partner works with grades  K-3 to provide expanded day programming during the school day and as part of our after school program. This  support has included Once Upon a Summer summer programming, I Read foundational literacy computer based  program, professional development for second and third grade teachers and instructional leadership support.    We partner with Doing Art Together, an organization who work with our K-5 classes to integrate STEM and Art  teaching and learning. We are also partnering with C'Mom. This partnership works not only with students but also  provides classes to parents. It concentrates on integrating the arts into STEM in our 2nd thru 5th grade classes.    We also participate with the Eastside House Afterschool program which provides afterschool care and academic  support to students in grades K-5.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We currently have 330 students.    21% of our student population have an IEP.   Specific needs of our this population are managing their learning disabilities, improving their speech and language  processing and academic language.    115 students are identified as English language Learners.    Specific needs of our ELL students are the need for academic language, conversations and experiences so that they  can engage with the content. Our ENL teachers provide workshops based on language modalities to all teachers,  which helps the teachers to meet the language and academic needs of all students. ENL teachers also plan with  classroom teachers monthly during their Common Planning period.    Our IEP teacher meets with the teachers and assists them in meeting all mandates.    The IEP teacher also works with a small group of students using the SPIRE Program in order to meet the needs of our  neediest lower grade students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Our students with IEPs also receive additional classroom support as well as social and emotional support during the  school day.    Our ELL students have access to IPads and a variety of teaching methods are used in order to ensure that they have  access to Common Core Instruction. We use our Title III funds to provide our English Language Learners added  support by providing them with an after school program and providing the parents with additional workshops that are  aligned with the State Standards in order to help them help their children become successful.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   MADE PROGRESS: 5C: Collaborative Teachers   We have made significant progress in teachers planning together and willingness to learn from each other.    Teachers meet weekly to plan together during their common planning time and we have evidence of teachers  meeting on their own to continue their collaboration.   A cohort of teachers participate in two professional learning communities facilitated by the    the ATAPE Group through our partnership with ReadNYC.    One PLC has focused on the best, rigorous and culturally relevant literacy practices and the other has focused on the  cultivation of teacher leaders who possess an equity mindset to support the accelerated achievement of all students.         MADE PROGRESS: 5B: Supportive Environment       Progress has been made on student engagement and student independent thinking.   We have focused on helping teachers provide supportive and actionable feedback to students   that will provide students with the skills to become not only independent thinkers but college and career ready.      Progress has been made in creating a supportive environment for families. We are working collaboratively with  United Way, READNYC and the Children's Health Fund to provide workshops to parents and all staff members on  promoting attendance awareness issues and how trauma affects students. The guidance counselor will continue to  meet with students and parents that are new to our PS 179 family to ensure that all families feel welcomed.       Key Areas of Focus for This Year:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      5A: Rigorous Instruction   We will continue to focus more on Professional Development aligned to the Next Generation Standards and to look in  depth at how to add academic rigor to our daily instruction. We will continue to monitor and focus on questioning  techniques that help to make students more independent thinkers. We will continue to work on giving students  actionable and timely feedback during conferences. We will focus on analyzing student work and monitoring/revising  for trends and creating next steps based on the needs of students.       We must continue to focus on instruction, professional learning and parent engagement so that we can continue  progressing academically and socially as a school community.

We provide school tours for families so that they may visit the school in action.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers are invited to participate in selecting the assessments for the school through the Measures of Student  Learning Committee. This committee receives professional development from the department of education on the  various types of assessments that are available to all students. The committee discusses the options with the staff and  asks for their feedback. The committee makes a recommendation to the principal regarding the type of assessment  that they would like for the school to administer. Teachers also meet in Teacher Teams to discuss variety of  assessments and decide which assessments they will use as a grade to assess the learning of all students .The  Instructional Team meets monthly to discuss strategies to improve instruction and make recommendations as to what  materials we should use to assess students. They bring resources to the meeting so that they can be reviewed by the  team.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36   purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 179, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          PS 179 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

After reviewing the NYSESLAT scores as well as ELA scores  from previous years, we have observed that students are deficient in the development of English  academic language. Students must work on developing academic vocabulary. The after school  program will enhance students reading and writing skills. The ultimate goal of the Title III after  school program is to provide students with needed scaffolding which will assist them in their  classrooms in further developing comprehension skills and strategies.  The program will be dedicated to kindergarten and first grade students who are in the expanding  range; second third, fourth and fifth grade English Language Learners who are entering,  emerging transitioning and  expanding. The program will focus on building vocabulary and  helping prepare these students to meet the demands of the Common Core. We will definitely  service ALL long-term ELLs as data indicates that these are the students who struggle the most  in advancing on the NYSESLAT.  The program will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. beginning in  November  and ending in January.  Two bilingual and/or ESL certified teachers will work the Title III after school program. Both  teachers will use S.P.I.R.E. kits with beginners and transitioning students. S.P.I.R.E. is an Orton  Gillingham researched based comprehensive reading program which also targets phonemic  awareness.    and the long-term group will use Ready new York CCLS.

The purpose of the professional development workshops is for teachers to integrate  research based strategies that are aligned with the Common Core and as a result will improve  student achievement. Teachers will also understand the importance of monitoring student  progress and using such data to plan instruction.  All teachers (since we have ELLs in all classrooms)  will receive professional development  offered by our ENL teachers who have been trained by the Department of Education and the  Office of English Language Learners. Also, all pedagogues will receive professional  development from Maria Guerrero, ELL Services administrator from the BFSC on integrated  teaching (ENL push-in).

Teachers will learn how to assess  students regularly during instruction in order to diagnose evidence of learning by individual  students.  Teachers will also receive professional development in the area of aligning the  Common Core to teaching ELLs within the content area. Teachers will learn how to plan lessons  which indicate correspondence between assessments and instructional outcomes. Teachers will  also learn how to provide a variety of appropriately challenging resources that are differentiated  for students in their class. Bilingual and ESL teachers will continue to  attend workshops offered  by the Office of English Language Learners and by the Office of Students with Disabilities.

At  P.S. 179, we are always encouraging parental involvement. We will offer at least three  workshops throughout the school year (excluding CookShop for Families). Each workshop runs  for approximately 90 minutes from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. during this time a pedagogue will  remain with students assisting them with their homework while parents attend the workshops.  Topics to be covered are: " Reading Non-fiction to English Language Learners", "Helping Your  Child Enhance His/Her Writing Skills" and "How to Help Your Child Increase His/Her  Expressive Skills."  the workshops will be presented by Ursula Ramirez, ENL teacher; Hanna Calderón, Bilingual  Speech Therapist assisted by our Parent Coordinator, Amy Casanova.  Parents will be notified of these activities via a letter sent home with their child (tear-off included  for monitoring number of atendees) and, a reminder follow-up phone call. Interpretation services  are offered to parents, and all notices that are sent home are translated. This will ensure that  parents are both, informed about the programs, and can participate in a meaningful way.   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 179 presently uses Fountas & Pinnell to assess student's independent reading levels as well as the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT  scores. The data is then used to determine student's individual language acquisition levels. These results consistently have  revealed that our ELLs are most deficient in writing skills. With this information teachers know that when planning their  lessons, they must incorporate more graphic organizers, visuals and any other form of scaffold to support and strengthen  student's writing skills.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Classroom teachers receive intensive professional development in reading and writing. Students receive small group  instruction through the Response to Intervention program.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  it is based upon scores on the NYSESLAT, running record, writing on demands,  performance assessments and unit exams.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    At the beginning of the school year, the Principal and Assistant Principal meet to review end of year data to determine  students who will receive RTI/AIS during the first cycle. Teachers attend a workshop provided by our IEP teacher and SETSS  teacher on the referral process for RTI. Upon completion of baseline assessments, teachers begin referring students to receive  RTI/AIS services.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   During literacy blocks, teachers allocate time to meet with small groups of students and provide scaffolds for struggling English  Language Learners to help develop their oral language. The schools' Social Worker closely monitors students attendance  record. The ENL teachers along with administrators interpret and analyze NYSESLAT scores on a yearly basis as well as  maintaining record of outstanding students' individual observations noted from year to year.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    NYSESLAT, ELA, MATH and NYSITELL     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher analyzes data from both ELA and NYSESLAT to determine ELL status and grouping of students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students are grouped by grade and by their levels on the NYSESLAT. It is a pull-out model except for two periods of  push-in into the kindergarten classroom.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Teachers in the TBE program use data from NYSESLAT and ongoing running records using Fountas and Pinnell in order  to group students according to their English acquisition levels.        c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Based on students scores on the NYSESLAT, they are grouped according to their english acquisition level. Entering and  Emerging receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction. The minutes are divided into 45 minute blocks. Expanding students receive  180 minutes of ENL instruction which is spread out into 45  minute blocks.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the freestanding ENL model, the content area of science is taught in English. Approaches used include: SIOP, the Language  Experience and TPR. In the TBE program model, teachers use TPR and The Language Experience model.  In both TBE and ENL  programs students who scored on an entering level are instructed in their native language.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Teachers use Fountas & Pinnell running record in Spanish.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For newcomers, long-term ENLs and 4-6 years of receiving ENL services, we offer after-school Title III program and Title III  summer school. Newcomers participate in the Cookshop program. Former ELLs receive an additional year of ENL.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Core Knowledge which is a phonics based program is used with first and second  grade ELLs-SWD . Teachers of ENLs and SWDs  incorporate different modalities into their teaching. they present students with many visual cues through pictures , ipads,  laptops and smart boards. They also allow students to listen to stories. Students are exposed to non-fiction through big books,  computers and then offered many scaffolds for expressing their ideas and thoughts in writing.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Kindergarten students  receive instruction in their classroom (push-in model) from the ENL teacher in their general education  setting. Fourth and fifth grade ELLs/SWD receive instruction using a pull-out model along with peers in the general education  setting thus, allowing the attainment of proficiency in English within the least restrictive environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sherry Font Williams, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 179                                                                              School DBN: 07X179  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language that they  understand, we at P.S. 179, analyze data obtained from individual student's HLIS. We also gather individual ELL  student information from the ATS RAPL report. We (ENL teacher, Parent Coordinator and administration) also use  data collected by teachers through individual teacher made parent surveys that are sent home during the first  week of school. Data is also gathered during the first Parent Association meeting and throughout the rest of the  school year.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication.
