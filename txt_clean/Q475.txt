The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   1.School Community   MISSION STATEMENT:   Our mission is to produce young adults who are happy, well-adjusted and academically prepared to face the  challenges of the future and to contribute significantly to societal progress. The highlight of our strong instructional  program is our interdisciplinary approach to teaching English, Social Studies, Math and Science within a guidance- oriented cohort structure as it encourages success in all students. We build personalization by dedicating counselors  to students for 4 years. The school’s slogan, “Diversity is our strength,” is derived from our multicultural population  and promotes a learning environment based on self-discipline and mutual respect for all. It is our goal to have every  student develop a curiosity for continued learning throughout life.   Richmond Hill High School is a Small Learning Community (SLC) STEAM school; our SLC’s personalize instruction for  our diverse population. We have restructured our SLC’s around a S(cience) T(echnology) E(ngineering) A(rt)  M(athemathics) theme based upon both student and community interest. Our newest Steam academy is our  Computer Engineering program and CTE approved Hospitality and Tourism program. Our STEAM program is career  themed and structured to provide CCLS based lessons with a career theme. All incoming freshman enter the Ninth  Grade Academy where they take core courses with the goal of earning ten or more credits and two Regents exams by  the end of the year. The Ninth Grade Academy is premised on the idea that success in the Ninth Grade equates to  success in graduating from High School. Incoming English as a New Language students enter the International  Academy where they receive ENL instruction and if requested, Bilingual instruction in Spanish. Ninth Graders choose a  STEAM Academy for grades ten through twelve at the end on the ninth grade. Our Science and MATH Academies are  partnered with the National Academy Foundation who provides numerous supports including curriculum,  partnerships and internships. The goal of each Academy is for our students to become college and career ready as  well as life-long learners.   Richmond Hill High School’s community is best reflected in our slogan, “Diversity is our strength.” Our school’s  population is 48% Hispanic, 14% Black, 5% White, 3% American Indian and 1% other. Within each of these  designations are numerous subgroups from a myriad of countries. Richmond Hill High School’s community prides  itself on being diverse and continuously strives to make sure all stakeholders are equally represented.    Our Ninth Grade Academy has been an area of strength for many years that has resulted in 74% of our ninth grade  students earning ten or more credits. An ongoing challenge is replicating the results of the Ninth Grade Academy in  grades 10-12; only 64% of students in the tenth grade earned enough credits to be promoted to the eleventh grade.  This has had an impact on our graduation rate.    Richmond Hill High School has made tremendous growth in its attendance over the previous year going from a  79.64% daily attendance rate in 2012-2013 to 86.7% in 2017-2018. We are focused on improving our graduation rate  this year. Our main mechanism for improving the graduation rate will involve the implementation of our theory of   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12      action which reads, “If we develop the concept of ownership in our students, then we will improve student  achievement.”       Some of our numerous collaborations include the National Academy Foundation , SUNY Farmingdale College, St.  Johns College and York College. Most of our College collaborations result in our students receiving college credit while  in high school. Special initiatives that are being implemented are curriculum development with a dedicated, SIG- funded curriculum coach, Math coaching from Metamorphosis, entry into cohort 2 of Mayor DiBlassio’s Computer  Engineering Program.      One of the successes this year was the professional teacher collaborations that have taken place. Richmond Hill High  School adheres to a distributed leadership model that creates a broad horizontal leadership structure which is an  integral part of the decision making process. Currently, we have numerous teacher teams operating including;   ● Departmental curriculum development teacher teams that develop curriculum maps, unit plans and lesson plans.    ● Common Planning Teams that analyze student work using tuning protocols   ● Departmental common assessment teams that act as point people between the Data Driven Classroom coordinator  and the departmental AP supervisor.   ● Writing is Thinking Strategic Inquiry (WITSI) teams that work with the Renewal team    ● Office of Student Progress teacher team that is responsible for programming, data analysis, assessment  administration and leads Small Learning Community (SLC) directors. The Office of Student Progress teacher team acts  as the bridge between the organizational systems and instructional systems and allows for clear communication to  occur between the structures. The programmers work with the departmental Assistant Principal's to implement  instructional programs of study aligned to Richmond Hill High Schools primary goal of promoting college and career  readiness. The programmers in turn collaborate with the assessment coordinator and data specialist to determine  who is and isn’t college ready according to their academic data. This information is turn-keyed to the SLC director who  meets with SLC teacher teams and shares student information.       2. How Students Learn Best   There is a common belief among the Richmond Hill High School community that students learn best when there is an  authentic environment of respect and rapport between student and teacher and between students, the lesson is  student centered, teachers engage in frequent checks for understanding and students are cognitively challenged in  the lesson.    Teacher pedagogy at Richmond Hill High School is driven by adherence to the Danielson 2013 Rubric and the  implementation our school’s instructional focus that states;   ● INSTRUCTIONAL FOCUS: If we believe that students learn best when they engage in appropriately challenging  Regents aligned tasks and teachers are supported with the development of CCLS and NY State Commencement based  curricula, then we will improve student ownership and positively impact student achievement. .   Our instructional focus is our Common Core based enacted curriculum and aligns with Danielson Rubric components  3b, 3c and 3d. Our instructional focus is implemented in our classrooms through the use of our school-wide writing   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13      project that stresses both our teacher’s ability to embed the Common Core Learning Standards instructional shifts  into their lessons and students intellectual engagement with the lesson.   3. Special Populations   26% of our population are English as a New Language students and 12% of our population have an Individual  Educational Plan. In addition, we have numerous students who are both English as a New Language and have an  Individualized Education Plan. These populations have very specific needs with language acquisition, literacy and  social-emotional development.       4. Family Engagement   Richmond Hill believes that strong family, community and school partnerships are fundamental in positively impacting  student achievement. Our approach to family engagement starts with our parent coordinator, community associate,  SLT and PTA. We work together to collaborate and communicate. Leveraging our partnerships allows for us to have an  open door policy towards welcoming families. One of the strongest areas of growth in relation to family engagement  is around the area of post-secondary planning for each student. We have held numerous workshops during the school  year to promote college access informational sessions around the college application process, FAFSA, scholarships and  best matches. In addition, we expanded our community nights to include numerous small group forums that parents  could participate in.    .   5. Strong Partnerships    Currently we have several strong Community based Organization (CBO) partnerships-   SAYA! – South Asian Youth Action group, a non-profit partner provided both academic and social emotional support  to students. They had staff in the building full-time that provided drop in support to students of all cultural  backgrounds. After school programs included dance, photography, SAT prep and academic tutoring. SAYA also  provided a much-needed cultural connection for the large Southeast Asian population in our school, resulting in a  more inclusive school environment. In addition, SAYA played a significant role in diffusing potential conflict by  providing social/emotional support and mediation to students.       In addition we are working with CARA who specialize in providing college access opportunities to first generation  college attendees.       6. Expanded Learning Time      Richmond Hill High School in partnership with SAYA, our CBO runs 2 different but integrated types of Expanded  Learning Time (ELT) opportunities;      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          14         1. All students are on an extended 1-9 period day. Building ELT into our students schedules allows for strategic  programming based upon individual students needs. Our students who are exceeding standards take College Now, AP  and College in the Classroom courses while our approaching standards students take thematic based selectives  designed to provide additional supports for Regents exams.      2. We also run numerous clubs after school as part of ELT for all students such as robotics, Anime, SAT prep and  leadership.             2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q475   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1681   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?       Instructional Focus:   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18      If we believe that students learn best when they engage in appropriately challenging Regents aligned tasks and teachers  are supported with the development of CCLS and NY State Commencement based curricula, then we will improve  student ownership and positively impact student achievement.       Our instructional focus is written to be aligned with our theory of action that states, "If we develop the concept of  student ownership in our students, then we will improve student outcomes."   Our adherence to and consistent reference to our theory of action and its alignment to our instructional focus has been  one of the ways we have been successful in improving student outcomes and developing student ownership. All our  pedagogically based professional development is anchored in our instructional focus and allows us to create  instructional coherence across the school. Our new instructional focus will continue to anchor our PD planning for next  year. It will be a major look-for during instructional rounds. Additionally, our instructional focus will be embedded in our  continued curriculum development.         What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   Our vision is deeper integration of CCLS-aligned curricula with our ENL and SWD populations so that all our students  graduate as college and career ready. Our newly formed integrated ENL/ELA and ENL/ Social Studies classes will  accelerate the process of meeting the needs of our diverse learners. The curriculum co-planning between the ENL and  ELA/ Social studies departments will allow for our ENL students to have numerous entry points into a lesson.       In addition, we will continue to deepen curricula development with an alignment to the instructional shifts focusing on  academic vocabulary development, usage of primary sources, non-fictional text and reliance on evidence based  answers.         What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  We have restructured our SLC’s around a S(cience) T(echnology) E(ngineering) A(rt) M(athemathics) theme based upon  both student and community interest. One of our Steam academies is our Computer Engineering program which we  applied for and was accepted into cohort 2. Our STEAM program is career themed and structured to provide CCLS based  lessons with a career theme.       In addition, we will expand our partnership with CARA and align our college access work through year 2 of the College  Access for All Equity and Excellence initiative.       With the support of our curriculum coach, we have embedded numerous CCLS strategies in our curriculum. The  instructional shifts in the ELA and mathematics classrooms can be seen with the use of evidence-based answers, a focus  on academic vocabulary, primary source documents in the content areas as well as math fluency and a deep  understanding of math concepts..         2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          19      What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   At the center of our core beliefs is the idea that if we develop the concept of ownership in our students then we will  improve student achievement. Cultivating student ownership leads to students taking responsibility for their high school  career and in turn leads to post-secondary success. We also believe that its our responsibility to communicate high  expectations to our students and provide them with the tools to develop student ownership. Richmond Hill High  School's adherence to a strong instructional core is a primary way we bring our core beliefs of student ownership to  fruition, and our pedagogical practices, rigorous curricula and assessment strategies showcase our beliefs of how  students learn best.

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  Pedagogues will use multiple methods to make sure all students have entry points into the lesson including multiple  primary sources, tiered tasks, student choice on assignments and homogeneous and heterogeneous grouping.         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  Richmond Hill High School has a fully integrated system of administrating common assessments and using the data to  have a positive impact on student outcomes. We have significantly expanded the use of our common assessments and  by systemizing the administration, analysis and subsequent adjustments to both content and pedagogy. We use IO  Education's data driven classroom (DDC) platform to standardize the process of administration and data analysis. All  content departments have common assessment calendars and a DDC point person who creates both the student  answer sheets and analysis of results.       The continued use of common assessments using IO Education's DDC platform in the core content areas will allow to  determine strengths and weaknesses in our curricula and allow for quick adjustments to pedagogical practice. It allows  for a culture of did the students learn it rather than but I already taught that.

We will continue to build relationships with the community by holding  more family engagement sessions and having creating parent leader teams through our CBO SAYA.      Richmond Hill High School’s vision is that the “community works to provide a safe and supportive learning environment  where diversity strengthens individuals and the community. Students’ academic, social and emotional growth is a  collaborative effort resulting in readiness for college and careers in the 21 st century .” It is paramount to the success of  the school that the students’ social and emotional needs are systematically addressed. If fact, our student’s academic  success is contingent upon the success of Richmond Hill’s ability to support our students. Our primary CBO is SAYA  which we are currently working with to set up a structure both during the school day and during ELT to address our  student’s social-emotional needs. We are currently using the PBIS model and several of our teachers have been trained.    The goal of moving forward is to have the entire staff trained turnkey the model school wide. This will occur during CPT  time. The formation of our grade level academy CPT’s in addition to our SLC CPT’s will provide the necessary time  needed to train our entire staff. In addition, dedicated grade level guidance counselors will meet with both teachers and  students to promote social and emotional development.    We also plan to embed social emotional development in curricula across the school with the assistance of our SPARK  counselor. He has been instrumental in providing training to our students with one on one support, group counseling  sessions and classroom based module instruction.    Another goal moving forward is to use Pupil path and Skedula as the primary communication platform so students,  parents and staff members can communicate effectively. We plan to increase the usage of both systems by signing  parents up as they enter the building, during our freshman orientation, PTA meetings and parent-teacher conferences.  This will help us increase our attendance rate which has been increasing over the last two years.   Additionally, another goal that was formulated from attending Harvard University’s School Turnaround Leaders  conference was developing an authentic rapport between teacher and student that creates a meaningful relationship.  Another focus will be developing lesson plans that motivate students by connecting to their individual lives thereby  personalizing the instruction.   Attendance will be closely monitored by the newly formed grade level teacher teams and SAYA. Our attendance  improved during the 2016-2017 school year. The grade level teacher teams will be responsible for making daily outreach  to all students who are absent. The attendance office will work in collaboration with the grade level teams to identify  students who have shown patterns of missing school. SAYA will provide social-emotional supports for students at-risk  and activities after school that will draw students to school.          Who are your CBO partners?

Although it is understood that the Principal is the instructional leader, numerous people with  leadership roles assisted in the crafting of this document including the administrative cabinet, grade level and  departmental inquiry teams, peer collaborative teachers, SLT, PTA and student leadership.      Moving forward, students and teachers at Richmond Hill High School will be organized and programmed by grade level  with our SLC’s embedded within the grade academy. This will provide additional support for students and teachers  because teachers will work collaboratively with other teachers based common goals. The goal will be a continuation of  curriculum revision based upon common standards that are horizontally aligned by grade level across the disciplines.  The rationale is based upon several key ideas including the success of our Ninth Grade Academy, The success of the High  School for Telecommunications model as outlined in the publication “Data and Design in balance” as well as the  understanding based upon data analysis that shows a drop-off in credit accumulation between the 9 th and 10 th grades  of about 10%. This restructuring plan will assist with the development of successful teacher teams at the upper grade  levels as we have in the ninth grade. Additionally, our curriculum revision teacher teams are successfully revising and  aligning curriculum in all of the content areas.    Teachers will be meeting in CPT meetings by grade level for all grades. This will allow for interdisciplinary lesson  planning to occur. Departmental meetings will address the vertical alignment of curriculum between grade levels. The  goal will be to spiral up the rigor and align the standards and academic tasks from the ninth grade to the twelve grade.  Additionally, WITSI inquiry teams will also operate within the ninth and tenth grade academies with training and  professional development provided by the HSAI team. This intensive look at student work based upon WITSI classroom  pedagogical strategies will allow for the development of teacher practice.              How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  Expanding the use of cabinet inquiry to include teacher teams from every department will provide another layer of  transparency and additional professional development opportunities. Inclusion of peer collaborative teachers in cabinet  inquiry.         How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   The continued use of Strategic Inquiry protocols that were developed in our grade level teams will provide a unified  approach within our varied teacher teams. The goal of all of strategic inquiry is to improve student outcomes be it our  grade level teams, curriculum teams, professional development or common assessment teams. The singleness of  purpose coupled with a unified strategy will allow all our teams to be able to share best practices based upon results  driven inquiry.          How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   As mentioned above, the use of a standardized inquiry approach will allow for the transference practices and  information between teacher teams. Each teacher team leader shares out at our weekly departmental meetings.      What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Data Reviewed   ADVANCE Teacher  level reports   ADVANCE School Level  reports   DDC Common  Assessment Data    Formative Assessment  tracker      Part 3 – Annual Goal   Content AP’s will personalize actionable feedback based upon individual teacher ratings.

Richmond Hill High School prides itself as an educational organization that functions according to a distributed  leadership model. Although it is understood that the Principal is the instructional leader, numerous people with  leadership roles assisted in the crafting of this document including the administrative cabinet, grade level and  departmental inquiry teams, peer collaborative teachers, SLT, PTA and student leadership.       Richmond Hill High School is dedicated to creating a school culture that promotes change for all stakeholders including  students, parents, community members, and staff members. Change begins and is sustained through the vision of the  principal and the implementation of that vision. One of the components that will allow this change to occur are strong  and positive relationships with all stakeholders including the cabinet, staff, students, parents and the lead CBO. Two  major focuses for the school moving forward will be enhancing rigorous instruction and promoting social-emotional  development of our students. The Renewal team will continue to assist with the enhancement of rigorous instruction  while our CBO will be a major partner in assisting with the task fostering social and emotional growth.    One major shift will be the reorganization of the school by grade academies that will allow us to focus on developing  grade level teacher teams and close monitoring of students by cohort. Our SLC’s will be embedded into this structure to  continue the career based programs of study our pathways offer. The goal of the grade level academies is to develop  sustained distributive leadership with the teacher leaders and Renewal coaches that maximize teacher capacity. Grade  level teacher leaders will work with the Renewal team to form an inquiry cycle that starts with observations to  determine needs, coaching meetings to develop a theory of action, common planning time to analyze student work  based upon coaching observations and inter-visitations to identify best practices. The assistant principals will oversee  and hold the grade level teacher leaders and teams accountable towards the school wide Renewal benchmarks.    In addition, the school will develop an observation system based upon short cycles that include actionable feedback and  specific professional development that is aligned to the feedback. Actionable feedback will be monitored by the school  leader with the expectation that feedback from the assistant principals will be aligned to the schools instructional focus.    The newly formed grade level teams will be lead by the new teacher leaders that were put into position during the  summer of 2015. The grade level teams and teacher leaders will be supervised by Paul Wilbur who has supervised the  Ninth grade Academy and plans to replicate the success across all grade levels. In addition, each grade level team with  have guidance supports who will be working with the teachers to support each students needs ranging from academic  to social emotional. In addition, the attendance team will work with the grade level teams to identify any patterns or  trends. The Principal will have weekly meetings with Mr. Wilbur and the teacher leaders to discuss progress of  attendance. The CBO will also be involved in the weekly meetings to ensure that additional supports are being utilized  effectively.       On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  Increase the quality of actionable feedback to both Administration and pedagogues.

How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   We will continue to deepen our use of the differentiated leadership model by training more lead teachers. This will be  done through our Common Planning Time teams. Additionally, we will utilize the New Visions Data portal within our  teacher teams to promote a deeper data driven culture.          How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  We will deepen our ties with the community by leveraging our relationship with SAYA to make sure everyone has a  voice in determining the academic progress at Richmond Hill High school.

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together  with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead  implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.

Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   1. SAYA plans to offer a comprehensive range of services to holistically address student needs. The services are  organized in the following areas:   1. Mental Health Services for students, parents and teachers   2. Intervention Services   3. College Guidance Services   4. Parental Engagement      2. Our ELT is designed so each student receives an extra period of instruction per day. Each student is on a 9 period  day. The additional instructional time is aligned to each students needs.    In conjunction with SAYA, we have recently opened a mental health clinic inside our school that is designed to offer  wraparound mental health services for students and their families.   3. We will coordinate with SAYA to strengthen community collaboration and partnerships through the engagement of  parents, students and teachers. SAYA has plans to hold monthly meet and greets with family members and  community members. Additionally, parent leaders will assist with deepening our outreach efforts.   4.

The New Visions sorter will be used in conjunction with our Are You Green campaign to promote student progress to  graduation. Our Are You Green campaign allows students to understand their individual progress to graduation and  provides interventions to make sure any students off track have the ability to get back on track.     Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the Community School program.  SAYA’s program will be integrated within Richmond Hill High School’s instructional day. Most of the time they spend  with students will be during ELT. SAYA will be provided with a dedicated office to work out of during the school day  and dedicated classrooms during ELT. SAYA will be providing the human resources for the Community School  Program. Since most of the services will be provided during our ELT, schedule adjustments will be minimal.      Part 3c. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates.  We are currently in the 3rd year of our Community Schools Initiative. One of the new foci for this year will be  partnering with Queens YMCA to provide paid internships to develop stronger community ties.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The MOSL committee, comprised of 6 teachers, will start meeting in August 2018 to discuss MOSL choices for the  2018-2019 school year. For the last 4 years, the MOSL committee has been unanimous in their decisions which have  been approved by the principal. The MOSL committee uses multiple data sources to determine which assessments  would best be aligned with the school’s instructional focus. Our MOSL selections are exclusively Regents  examinations. Additionally, all departments are using common, end of unit summative assessments as a tool to drive  both our school wide curriculum development and professional development. The common assessment data will be  used at multiple levels (student, teacher, department, school) to adjust instruction and add valuable input on  modifications necessary to the professional development offered throughout the year based upon student and  teacher need.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          80        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          81      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy  is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. Richmond Hill High  School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.  The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education  of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Richmond Hill High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          82      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          83      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Richmond Hill High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by  Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Recognizing that educating the "whole"  child is paramount, therefore, the Richmond Hill High School community works collaboratively  to support the academic, social, and emotional development of our students in order to prepare  them for post secondary success and participation in the 21st century global  economy.  Richmond Hill High is located in the central-southern area of the New York City  borough of Queens in District 27, where about 509 ELLs speaking more than 18 languages from  at least 30 countries comprise of approximately 30 % of the entire student body of about 1,828 in  Grades 9-12.  Most students classified as ELLs (ENTERING, EMERGING, TRANSITIONING,  and EXPANDING) have not yet met exit criteria as per their NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores or  students’ IEPs.  All our ELLs struggle as they have very limited skills in English and in their  native language, especially in reading and in writing. The Title III program will provide our  ELLs with supplemental instruction through an after school program and a Saturday enrichment  program.  The programs will be taught by a total of 10-14 teachers: four certified in ESL, one  licensed in ISS/Social Studies, two certified in Science, two certified in Mathematics, and one  certified in Spanish. Content area teachers teaching in "Integrated Teaching Model (Part154)"  classrooms will be given preference. The ENL Assistant Principal will supervise the program,  during the school week, Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 3:45-4:45 pm ,  for approximately 35 weeks, three days a week. The duration of  the program will include approximately 105 days with three instructional periods a day for a  total of 345  sessions The program will start on or about the end of September through mid- June.  All certified ESL and Part 154 teachers will focus on basic literacy skills and advanced  reading and essay writing skills,  Math and Science instruction aligned with the CCSS and  College and Career Readiness, to supplement day program coursework.  The program will support the necessary skills for the ELA, Living Environment, Global, US  History, Algebra and Geometry Regents Examinations, as well as the NYSESLAT  Exam.  Newly arrived students, SIFE students and those failing Regents exams will be especially  targeted and provided small-group literacy instruction.  The certified Spanish (NLA) teacher will  focus on developing parallel literacy skills and critical analysis through writing and native  literature study as well as prepare for the NLA Spanish exam.  Certified content area teachers in  Science, Math and Social Studies will provide supplemental instruction in Regents level courses,  such Living Environment, Algebra, Global and US History.   All teachers will provide  differentiated instruction to groups of students based on their NYSESLAT/Regents scores and  will implement ESL instructional strategies, such as, scaffolding, sentence frames and starters,  graphic organizers, Witsi, word banks and flexible grouping to assist in the development of  academic language development in each subject area.  The instruction will use traditional leveled  materials, bilingual dictionaries, teacher-made materials, leveled books and Imagine Learning  software. These programs will provide traditional and e-learning resources and enhance learning  based on the students' Lexile levels by providing leveled language support and tailored  individualized instruction.   Additionally, this instruction will help students in communicating   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          89         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   with teachers, applying for college and future jobs, as well as with interpersonal relationships. In  addition, parental outreach and student outreach will be ongoing throughout the year to sustain  student attendance in the program. The subgroup that will be targeted for Imagine Learning are  SIFE, Entering, and repeat Entering and Emerging students. Transitioning and Expanding  students and seniors that have not yet pass the NYS ELA Regents will receive explicit  instruction in grammar, reading, and writing for the exam genre. Long-term ELLs will be  recruited to attend so that they receive additional support outside of the school day.

The focus will be mainly on the CCSS, CCR,  Differentiation, Assessment, Curriculum Mapping, WITSi, research  based instruction  strategies for teaching ELLs, and technology. Students will as a result, expand their academic  language/vocabulary, grammar,  and improve their reading, writing, speaking, listening, critical-thinking  and presentation skills, using informational and fiction texts, and technology. Developing English  proficiency in order to improve performance on all formative and summative assessments will allow  students to meet graduation requirements and be College and Career Ready.  Teachers in ENL, ELA,  Math and Science will attend professional development with Nancy Cloud for approximately 6 half or  full days in the year from 8 am-2:50 pm. The professional developer, Nancy Cloud,  in  collaboration with RBERN will hosted at the school so that coaching session in  and out of classrooms can take place. This in- house professional development will provide tailored support for Richmond Hill High School teachers of  ELLs. The ENL supervisor will coordinate and support this and other professional development twice a  month for one hour, on using data to guide instruction, ELL literacy strategies, differentiation,  and curriculum revision. The certified content area teachers (see page 1) in Science, Math, Social  Studies, (Spanish) NLA, ELA and ESL will create literacy tasks/units aligned with the CCSS for this  program, through collaboration and through sharing methodologies.  All teachers in this program will  also revise instructional materials, receive training in curricula and lessons, assessments and rubrics as  needed, to address all Regents tasks and/or the NYSESLAT exam.  Training will also be provided for  software program Imagine Learning used in the classroom targeting SIFE, Entering and Emerging level  students. Additional professional development will be provided in October to June to  ENL teachers one hour a week, after-school on either Tuesday or Thursday from 3:45-4:45 pm, for a  total of 30 sessions. A total of about 30 hours will be dedicated towards PD. The ENL Assistant  Principal will partner with the content area  Assistant Principals to develop Professional Development.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  RHHS uses ENL teacher-created periodic common assessments, Unit Exams, NYSITELL, MLS, and mid-year Regents Item  Analysis Data. This year ENL teachers will add CastleLearning and IRLA (Independent Reading Level Assessment) to their  repertoire of assessment tools. These assessments generate data used to help teachers differentiate instruction in the  classroom, group students accordingly, and increase student reading proficiency. The web-based curricula are aligned with the  Common Core and College and Career Readiness Standards.  ENL teachers examine data monthly to monitor and adjust  instruction/and/or to revise course curricula.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   ENL teacher-created common assessment calendar to administer and examine data monthly to monitor and adjust  instruction/and/or to revise course curricula.   Curriculum includes unit exams and Castle Learning assignments.

Teachers have access to  student laptops and computer lab usage for CastleLearning.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use the RLAT tool to evaluate the progress of our ENL program;  the number of ESL students who test proficient and their  progress through the NYSESLAT levels.  We also use it to predict progress of individual ELLs and to make intervention/curricula  adjustments as needed.   The availability of progress by home language allows us to determine the efficiency of our BTE  program and determine parental outreach language needs. The RLAT data guided our programming decisions across  disciplines (ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies). This data also helps us determine after school/Saturday school offerings  for under-credited and at-risk students.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We continue to see that ELLs perform better on Regents on their own home language than Regents exams in English.  Some  students tend to pass their content area courses but not the Regents exams in English for those courses.  Professional  Development sessions on Data were organized to provide teachers a look at the results and make decisions around  instructional objectives and areas of intervention.  Teachers examine the reports and look for patterns and trends to adjust  instructional objectives and areas of intervention.  Teachers examine the reports and look for patterns and trends to adjust  their instruction.  The development of the HLA is used in language development of ELLs.  Our students are therefore better  prepared for the NYSESLAT exam and Regents exams needed for graduation.  We monitor attendance rates as well and  provide support through our SBOs, guidance counselors, and teacher parent outreach.  Teacher meetings, common planning  time, collaborative item data analysis, student conferencing, report card conferencing, ENL study groups, ENL curriculum  writing activities, curriculum mapping, scaffolding in content area, co-teaching in content area, re-teach from teacher  data/common assessment, AIS, after-school Title III tutoring, programming based on performance and student needs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   This year, we examined the test data, including each modality results of the 2016 NYSESLAT, and RLAT to make programmatic  and progress decisions.  We evaluate the success of our ELLs based on AYP/Regents Exams and on growth across all levels in  the NYSESLAT.  We also evaluate our program based on the number of ELLs who pass the NYSESLAT.test out of ENL, Credit  Accumulate Rate, Regents pass rates, ELL graduation rate and ELL College and Readiness index rate.  We also use MLS data,  years of service, ELA and Math scores from Jr. High, credit accumulation and graduation rate.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We use PD dates, Department Meetings, and Common Planning Meetings that meet four times a week to discuss students'  progress.  This year teachers met after school to analyze data and make adjustments to lesson plans and curriculum.  We share  our "Are You Green" data with staff, students and parents, Google Drive, Skedula/Pupil Path, ATS, Guidance Counselors,  transcripts, CPTs and department meetings, e-mail, report card conferencing, turnkey PDs, portfolios, students folders are also  ways we disseminate findings and to make adjustments to our programs.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In accordance with CR Part 154.2 we program students according to their language level and graduation  needs.  Integrated ENL/content:  ELA, social studies, science, Entering and Emerging with a standalone, writing for  college readiness, grades 9/10 and 11/12, homogeneous levels by language acquisition level.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Our Transitional bilingual education (TBE) program (Spanish) is designed so that students develop conceptual skills in  their home language as they learn English.  All instruction is Common Core-aligned to accelerate student  achievement.  Our transitional bilingual education program therefore includes an ENL component designed to  develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English.  Students take a minimum of two content-area  courses/subjects in the home language and English.  A Spanish language arts component is part of our curriculum and  designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students' home language while cultivating  an appreciation of their history and culture.  All of the students in a TBE program share the same home language  which is Spanish.  ELL students in the bilingual program receive one (45 minute) period daily of HLA.  Bilingual content  area teachers follow the Language Allocation as per CR Part 154.2:  At the Beginning/Entering level, TBE students  receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English.  For the Low Intermediate/Emerging they  receive 60%/40%, for the Intermediate/Transitioning 50%/50% and for Advanced/Expanding 25%/75%.  As a student's  English proficiency increases, more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English.  TBE teachers make  several considerations when determining which language is best to teach certain concepts.  Students are assessed in  HLA skills (using Spanish Lab) and programmed accordingly.  Students in the TBE are programmed according to need  therefore, they are scheduled independently of there peers and move from class to class.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   All students receive the instructional minutes in accordance with their proficiency levels for each program model in  accordance with Part 154.2 programming units requirements.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   At Richmond Hill high School students are now programmed as per CR Part 154.2.  Students are groups homogeneously by  NYSESLAT proficiency level and by grade 9/10 and 11/12 in ENL stand-alone classes.  We offer ENL classes for each of the five  proficiency levels of ELLs based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Each class is 45 minutes for a single period class and 90  minutes for a double period class.  For the instruction of the content area classes, the ELLs are homogeneously grouped (one  to two levels and by grades).  ESL teachers will be team-teaching with content area English and Social Studies teachers to meet  minimum ENL and integrated ENL/content area minutes required in each proficiency level-see ELL Policy page 24.  Based on  assessment data, student enrollment and parent choice, ENL, NLA and bilingual/ESL content area classes are created and  offered to ELLs.  They are TBE Spanish content area classes in math, social studies, science as well as NLA and FS-ENL content  area classes.  ENL/ISS students are programmed in ICT, Self-Contained and SETSS.  Bilingual ISS students receive  paraprofessional support.  All decisions are dictated by the students' IEPs.  The explicit instruction of ENL (Freestanding) is  conducted by appropriately licensed pedagogues trained in the delivery instruction to ELLs.  These classes focus on academic  language and reading and writing skills aligned with the CCSS and the new NYSESLAT.  Similarly, students are exposed to both   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          96      fiction and non-fiction materials and provided with diverse tasks to appropriately interact with these resources.  All classes  provide vocabulary building and relevant grammar structures.  ENL instruction employs balanced literacy methodologies and  differentiated strategies geared toward supporting students in developing and using new language skills.  Students are  provided opportunities to conduct presentati9ons in front of the class and create writing projects as an additional means of  demonstrating mastery of the appropriate skill and comprehension of the material.  Most Commanding and Former ELLs are  programmed for further support beyond the 90 minutes a week.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The writing asssessments allow teachers to monitor student growth throughout the year. Students take the Spanish Regents  Exams/AP Spanish Exams. Spanish LAB, MLS, LOTE, interviews with staff members who speak and write students' L1, brain pop  in spanish, Achieve3000 and Castle Learning have L1 options, Exam Wizard in HL. This school year we are considering using the  ENIL assessment tool in addition to the Spanish Lab. HLA teachers received PD in June 2017 to introduce them to the  assessment program as a precursor to implementation.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE Students follow the Bridges curriculum in a double period class in lieu of the regular ENL/ELA course. Newcomer students  are grouped together and receive additional support through an elective history course that includes the REWARDS  PROGRAM. Other ELLs are programmed by language level and course needs. Instructions is differentiated using the following:  WIT, visuals, kinesthetic learning, flexible cooperative grouping, SIFE students double period, culturally sensitive material, IRLA,  Bridges program, intensive literacy phonics instruction, differentiated WIT, Wilson program, sentence starters and frames,  former ELLs: integrated ENL content Regents support, station teaching, intensive writing instruction, multiple choice, word  banks,differentiated strategies, circle maps, writing templates for all levels, pre-writing, modified writing process, lexile  appropriate text, activating prior knowledge with media, SIOP model, jigsaw reading, and modifying module based on skills.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ESL/ISS teachers currently use grade and age-appropriate materials/texts used in the content areas and are adapted based on  students' IEPs. ISS/ENL teachers are trained to utilize WITsi methodologies. Students in ISS/ESL classes are grouped by ENL  level using data and students' referencing IEPs. ISS and ENL teachers team teach togethr in all ISS/ENL classes. Teachers  therefore differentiate and scaffold content area instruction and provide more individualized instruction.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We use resource room, CTT classes (special ed, ENL teacher, and Content Area licensed teachers), modifications (extended  time on classroom tests and separate location, scribes for exams), modifications in curriculum for ELL-SWDs, Co-teaching that  serves ELL-SWDs, most ELL-SWDs are integrated into classes unless otherwise indicated on IEP, and paras for ELLs-SWDs in  integrated classes.     8.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Neil Ganesh, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          100                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Richmond Hill High School                                                                              School DBN: 27Q475  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Richmond Hill High School uses the biographical information available on admissions documents including the  Home Language Identification Survey and emergency cards as well as other available data on ATS (RCPL) to assess  the diverse linguistic background of the RHHS community. ATS reports (RAPL) and Part 3 of the Home Language  Identification Survey are regularly reviewed to confirm the home language preferences of the parents. The  numerous speakers of the major languages (Spanish, Punjabi, Hind, Bengali, Arabic) in the building are often used  for written translations and oral translations with parents when they visit during the day and for scheduled  meetings usually in the evenings. * *We will also administer a survey for the school faculty to determine the  languages spoken by school staff in order to have them availabe for written and oral translations on an "as- needed" basis.            2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          102     2.
