The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  East Williamsburg Scholars Academy's mission is to establish a safe and rigorous learning environment where our  scholars have opportunities to experience success to compete in a global society.                 2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   East Williamsburg Scholars Academy (EWSA) is a high school located in East Williamsburg in the heart of north  Brooklyn, NY. We have a diverse student population with 43% black, 53% Hispanic, 1% white, and 1% Asian and 2%  other, students of which 19% are SWDs, 26% of which are ELLs, and 70% of which are free lunch eligible. Boys makeup  54% while girls make up 46% of the school population.       The school is an academy that incorporates a college readiness and high expectations model. Through writing, inquiry,  collaboration, organization and reading tools the implementation will equip students to tackle complex issues,  problems, and texts.      Special initiatives being implemented this year are Virtual Enterprise, 3 additional AP courses and a Medgar Evers  Cuny Math program.        3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school has been reidentified as a Focus School. Students enter 9th grade with an average of below level 2 on the  NYSED ELA assessment and an average of 2 on the NYSED Mathematics assessment. Our CBO, St. Nick's Alliance  (academic and social services) partner with us to meet the needs of all of our students, including SWDs and ELLs. The  school is currently designated as a re-identified focus school that has received special recognition for our college  preparatory courses, AP for ALL and Algebra for ALL involvement.      4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school’s needs, as surfaced during our needs analysis, and seen during our Quality Review conducted on March,  2017 include the following:  1.2 Pedagogy: To enhance teacher pedagogy to engage students in student centered print rich classroom  environments and use instructional strategies that differentiate learning experiences to offer multiple entry  points and engage a diversity of learners by addressing their individual learning needs so that they develop  academic skills for college and career.     2.2 Assessment: To ensure teacher assessment practices consistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11      understanding and students’ self-assessment so that teachers can consistently make effective curricular  and instructional adjustments to meet students’ learning needs.     4.2 Teacher Teams and Leadership Development: To ensure that all teachers are engaged in structured,  inquiry-based professional collaborations that promote the achievement of school goals and the  implementation of CCLS.      Once established, the school’s vision and focus has been the impetus for change and growth throughout our  educational community, guiding our inquiry/teacher teams, programming, and professional learning. Besides our  areas of need, then, the Quality reviewer also recognized our considerable growth as stated in the areas of  celebration:   1.1 Curriculum: School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula and academic tasks consistently emphasize rigorous  habits and are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards, integrate the instructional  shifts, and make purposeful decisions to build coherence and promote college and career readiness for all students.   3.4 High Expectations: School leaders and staff consistently communicate expectations that are connected to a path  to college and career readiness and offer ongoing feedback to help families understand student progress toward  those expectations.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.     2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          45       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          46           Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 14K477 School for Legal Studies, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The School for Legal Studies will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  All new admit ELLs are assessed using the NYSITELL within ten days of their enrollment. If the student is a Spanish speaking ELL  student, the student is tested with the SLAB exam to determine proficiency in the native language.  At the beginning of the  year, students complete a diagnostic assessment to determine reading skills. Students are also assigned to Reading Plus, which  is an online software that assess their reading lexile level and assigns work accordingly. All ELLs also complete writing samples  to determine writing, reading and speaking skills.    ELLs that have taken the NYSESLAT the prior year have NYSESLAT scores broken down by modality. These test results are  shared with all teachers so that they are able utilize them as a guide for instructional planning.   Based on data garnered from these assessments, Common Core-aligned instruction is designed to challenge students and  ensure growth. We assess students constantly throughout the year by reviewing their performance on Common Core-aligned   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62      tasks in all four modalities -- reading (comprehension assessment), writing (essay assignment, follow up writing activity),  speaking (discussion techniques), and listening (group work and presentations). This ongoing assessment process allows us to  target specific needs of varying groups of ELLs.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Strategies targeting ELLs  include a transitional bilingual program (TBE) for incoming freshman and stand-alone ENL (English as  a New Language).     ELL students are provided equal accessibility to various programs such as, Algebra for All, AP for All, Peer Group Connection  and Medgar Evers Pipeline.     After-School ELL Academy is provided to support students academically in classes where they need extra academic support.     Integrated Subject Area Classes are provided in the Saturday Academy to support students who need credit Recovery.     A Language Acquisition Center is set up to support ELL students. The center has computers and headphones with easy access  to programs such as CastleLearning and Rosetta Stone.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In the classroom, we look at each student's attendance and punctuality. We also look at each student's portfolio and evaluate  the work done throughout the year. NYSESLAT is also a good indicator to determine whether a student has been able to reach  a higher English Proficiency level. We also look at credit accumulation, if each student acquired at least ten credits per school  year, including the amount of ENL minutes serviced as per the CR Part 154. Finally, we look at Regents scores to determine if  ELLs are on track towards graduation, and to determine if any extra tutoring or scaffolding is needed.       Some of the specific areas of need identified are:    Develop decoding skills with early, explicit, and intensive instruction in phonological awareness and phonics  Provide increased opportunities for ELLs to develop sophisticated vocabulary knowledge including strong academic language  Use challenging narrative and expository texts to teach comprehension strategies  Promote reading fluency with a focus on vocabulary and increased exposure to print/text     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The structures that we have place in order to address interventions regarding summative data are data analysis meetings.     In the ELL data meetings, the assistant principal, guidance counselors, ELL coordinator and other subject content teachers  meet to provide targeted intervention for specific students.     Some of the interventions available to students are ELL Academic Intervention Academy offered after-school and on  Saturdays. Another intervention available to students is one on one counseling, peer mentors, and credit recovery/course re- take. Finally, Student/Parent workshops are offered after-school where the parent and the student have the opportunity to  learn English and other skills together.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63         The NYSESLAT data reveals the students' levels in the four modalities which helps to guide and inform our ELL programs.  Additionally, the SLAB results are used to guide instruction in all classes and specifically the Home Language Arts (HLA) class.  The regents scores helps to inform which classes should be integrated (Integrated ENL Classes) based on the needs of the ELL  population.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ELL data team meets constantly to use the findings to guide and adjust existing programs. The ELL Data Analysis Tool,  ATS Reports, and Assessment Results are used to make necessary adjustments to programs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a. All ENL instruction is delivered in free-standing, departmentalized ENL classes, taught by fully certified ENL  teachers.  b. b.  ENL groups are primarily homogeneous by proficiency level.  Due to our large number of Entering level students  and their broad range of ability, we have divided them into Entering and Emerging levels.  Entering and Emerging level  classes are grouped together for two to three periods per day dependent on the amount of ENL minutes they are  required to attend.  An Entering proficiency level student will receive 540 minutes which includes Stand-alone ENL,  Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content area.  An Emerging proficiency level student will receive 360  minutes which includes Stand-alone ENL, Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content area.  An Transitioning  proficiency level student will receive 180 minutes which includes Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content  area.  An Expanding proficiency level student will receive 180 minutes in an Integrated  ENL/ELA setting. A Commanding proficiency level student will receive 90 minutes which  can include Integrated  ENL/ELA or  Integrated ENL/Content area.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Transitional Bilingual Program for incoming ELL freshman and sophomores. The school has content area classes  available in both English and Spanish. Students whose parents select the TBE Program will be placed in content area  classes in Spanish, as well as English as a New Language (ENL) and English Language Arts (ELA) classes. The student’s  scores in the NYSITELL will determine the number of hours students have in ENL and, when applicable, ELA classes.  Since the school is designed after the Transitional Bilingual Education Program model, parents who opt for the Dual  Language Program as their primary choice are informed that East Williamsburg High School does not have that  program at the moment. . Parents who select the ENL program as their first option are informed that their children  will be placed in content area classes taught in English. These students will also receive the mandated hours of ENL  support in freestanding classes. They will also have Spanish classes as a foreign language, not as a Native Language  Arts class.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.

East Williamsburg Scholars Academy has 46-minute period classes. An Entering proficiency level student will  receive 540 minutes which includes Stand-alone ENL, Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content area.  An Emerging  proficiency level student will receive 360 minutes which includes Stand-alone ENL, Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated  ENL/Content area.  An Transitioning proficiency level student will receive 180 minutes which includes Stand-alone ENL,  Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content area.  An Expanding proficiency level student will receive 180 minutes  which includes Stand-alone ENL, Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content area.  An Commanding proficiency level  student will receive 90 minutes which includes Stand-alone ENL, Integrated ENL/ELA and an Integrated ENL/Content  area.  Through the Transitional Bilingual Program, incoming freshman will receive HLA(Home Language Arts) for one period as  part of their academic schedule.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Our ELLs take math, science, and history course work with mainstream teachers.  Although they may not have ENL licenses,  these teachers learn about ELL strategies though our ENL teachers and continuous and targeted  Professional Development.  Strategies already in place include picture support, dictionaries and glossaries, word walls,  modified language (oral and written), translated documents and assignments, and differentiated assignments. For the majority  of core content area classes, the print is translated to the student's native language.  A modified content library, along with  native language resources, is available in the ENL classroom. Through the transitional bilingual program, incoming freshman  will receive bilingual classes in the areas in the areas of Social Studies and Algebra. Furthermore, the ENL students have a  Language Acquisition Center (LAC) where there are available resources and software available at the stationed computers. The  TBE program offer students of the same home language the opportunity to learn to speak, understand, read, and write in  English while continuing to learn academic content in their home language. The students’ home language is used to help them  progress academically in all content areas while they acquire English. The first year of TBE is directed through the model of  70% Spanish, 30% English. The second year of TBE is directed through 60% Spanish, 40% English. In an ENL program, language  arts and content-area instruction are taught in English using specific ENL instructional strategies. Some content area classes  are integrated ENL classes. Currently our integrated content class is Earth Science  Students receive core content area and  English language development instruction, including the use of the home/primary language as support and appropriate ELL  instructional supports to enrich comprehension. Integrated ENL classes are taught by a teacher dually certified in the content  area and ENL or are co-taught by a certified content area teacher and a certified ENL teacher. In a Stand-alone ENL class,  students receive English language development instruction taught by a NYS-certified teacher of English to Speakers of Other  Languages (ESOL) in order to acquire the English language needed for success in core content areas. This program typically  serves ELL students from many different home/primary language backgrounds whose only common language is English and  therefore cannot participate in a bilingual program.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Throughout the year, students periodically complete writing assignments in the native language, then the assignments are  read and evaluated by staff members who speak the same language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. There is urgency to provide academic intervention services for SIFE students.  We will take the following steps with these  students:  - Making an individualized student needs assessment  - Grade appropriate instructional support materials  - Differentiation of instruction in all areas   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65      -Programs: ELL Academic Intervention Academy  b. When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition:  - An informal student orientation  - Buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class that will assist during the day  - Encourage student to participate in After School activities.  - Home-school communication.  - Content-area glossaries are provided    -Offer to be part of the Transitional Bilingual Program  c. For those students receiving 4-6 years of service, we use the following procedures and resources to support our aim of  having students reach proficiency on the NYSELAT during this time period and before becoming long-term ELLs:  - All students are encouraged to attend After School programs and tutoring before school.  - There is focus of vocabulary acquisition, and students are taught and assessed on a minimum of ten academic/SAT  vocabulary words a week.  This vocabulary is always taught within the context of the curriculum.  - There is also a strong focus on writing, in which ELLs in this subgroup receive the lowest scores on the NYSESLAT.  Students  compose and publish a minimum of three portfolio items per marking period, including poetry, narrative memoir, research,  and essays.  Homework assignments are primarily journal entries.  d. An analysis of long-term ELL scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments suggests that their problem is one of  reading and writing. Our action plan for this group involves.  - Monitoring the progress of students in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs  - Ensuring that all ENL curriculum is literacy-based, with high-interest content  e. For the past two years we have had 0% of our ELL students reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  For students who do test  proficient, 1-2 years of transitional support are available in the form of continuing in ENL.  All prior ELLs continue to receive testing accommodations and ENL minutes (includes integrated ENL)) for two years following  their exit from the ENL program. Former ELLS also continue to receive 90 minutes of ENL services. These accommodations  were outlined in a letter from the superintendent in September 2015 and include the following:  - Time extension (time and a half)  - Separate location (ELLs and Former ELLs are generally tested together)  - Third reading of the Listening Selection on the English Regents Exam.  - Bilingual glossaries are provided for use during state tests  - Simultaneous use of English and Alternate Language Editions of state exams is approved for use by ELLs and Former ELLs  - For lower-incidence languages, we use school faculty or a hired translator to give students an oral translation of state tests.  - When taking a state test in with a native language translation, students are allowed to write their responses in their native  language as well.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All curriculum is created or adapted on-site by ENL teachers and reflects academic/graduation needs of students. For example,  literacy instruction always includes subject-area content, with a primary focus on social studies or science. Most of the  materials used are non-fiction/informational, and include journalism, memoir, documentary and primary sources. These are  supplemented with non-informational sources such as poetry, fiction, and artwork. Listening and note-taking skills are a daily  part of the curriculum to promote college readiness. Students often listen to brief excerpts from college-level lectures and take  scaffold notes. Students must communicate for information on a daily basis, through collaborative or cooperative learning  activities. Students further develop all four modalities by engaging in public speaking activities, writing and delivering speeches  to their classmates. Strategies are constantly evolving based upon a highly diverse student population which changes  dramatically from year to year.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Scheduling flexibility is used in the case of students who are moved to a higher-level class than their NYSESLAT scores would  indicate, based upon in-class performance and the observations of ENL teachers. After reviewing IEP testing modifications,  these are applied to classroom instruction at the teachers' discretion (i.e. modified materials, extended time, scribes, modified   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66      responses, etc.). Curricular flexibility is apparent in the availability of student choice in assignments and assessments.  Instruction in ENL classes is differentiated to meet the needs ot ELL-SWDs . Outside of ENL classes, guidance counselors  schedule ELL-SWDs for classes that maximize time spent with non-disabled peers while still maintaining compliance with IEPs.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We have several structures in place and available to ELLs as targeted intervention.  Each ELL student participates in one or  more of the following, depending on their needs:  - Entering level ELL students may participate in the Peer Tutoring program with bilingual students who have tested out of ELL  services.  -Students are invited to be part of the ELL Academic Intervention Program which caters to all subject core areas and is  provided in spanish.  - Title III monies will be spent on extracurricular instruction and extended learning for ELLs, including Regents preparation and  language development through the arts.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on our SLAB and El examen de Lectura en Espanol (ELE) results, we will have AP Spanish this upcoming school year open  to all students who meet the requirements.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Existing programs and services will be modified, but none will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ENL students are given equal access to school programs.  This is accomplished by daily announcements in the ENL  classroom, which are translated when necessary.  All letters sent home are translated. The parent coordinator is bilingual so  parent outreach is easily done.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All ELLs will use the following instructional materials, except when specified:  -Teacher-designed curriculum and content.  - Teacher-generated worksheets and projects  - Teacher-selected film/music/images to support student contextualization  - multiple sources to build schema on unit topics, including film clips, artwork, music, and poetry  - Supportive websites such as www.jmap.org (Math)  - utililization of Google Drive  - Multi-genre classroom library of both informational texts and fiction  - Bilingual content-area glossaries  - Practice tests for Regents preparation  -Reading Plus program   On a case-by-case basis, content area teachers and our ENL instructors provide materials specific to students’ ages and grade  levels.  We are in the process of compiling a resource library with multi-level resources for all topics within our content area  classes’ scope and sequence.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Bilingual dictionaries and word-to-word glossaries are available for all languages present in the ENL classroom.  Cognates are  explicitly taught to students speaking native languages.  Often the ENL teacher pauses at an important vocabulary word and  has higher level students translate into all of the languages present in the room. AN SIOP model lesson is constantly  encouraged in the classroom. Teachers are encouraged to have a content and language objective in their lesson plans.  Online   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67      videos showing math lessons are made available to students in English, and are also available in Spanish on www.jmap.org.  When possible, we include native language support for ELLs in content-area classrooms as well.  Each student is provided with  a native-language word-to-word glossary for their content area classes if it is beneficial to the student. ll ELLs travel with a  bilingual dictionary for all of their classes  - Teachers are instructed to use translation software and images for important terms within their curriculum.  - All math lessons are available to students in English or Spanish using the Pearson website.  - Student and teacher translators are available for Spanish and Arabic, our primary two language groups.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All support materials are chosen to be grade and age appropriate.  While our ENL classrooms support English language  development, all instruction is presented within the parameters of a high school curriculum.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All ELLs will use the following instructional materials, except when specified:  Teacher-designed curriculum and content.  - Teacher-generated worksheets and projects  - Teacher-selected film/music/images to support student contextualization  - multiple sources to build schema on unit topics, including film clips, artwork, music, and poetry  - Supportive websites such as www.jmap.org (Math)  - utililization of Google Drive  - Multi-genre classroom library of both informational texts and fiction  - Bilingual content-area glossaries  - Practice tests for Regents preparation  -Reading Plus program   On a case-by-case basis, content area teachers and our ENL instructors provide materials specific to students’ ages and grade  levels.  We are in the process of compiling a resource library with multi-level resources for all topics within our content area  classes’ scope and sequence.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   ELLs who enroll throughout the school year receive a variety of support to help them acclimate to their new school:  - the use of a native language buddy/tutor  - a school tour is conducted by a native language peer   - reading materials are provided in native language  -access to the ELL library     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The school offers Spanish as a Foreign Language classes. Qualified students take the LOTE.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers meet with content-area teachers during prep and/or common planning time. An ongoing targeted ELL PD has  been arranged where Saturdays and After-schools are accommodated to offer teachers professional development where all  teachers of ELLs are invited. These regular meetings compose the majority of teacher professional development in teaching  English Language Learners. They are also invited to participate in one of the trainings offered by the New York City Department  of Education.  During these meetings, curriculum and resources are discussed.  Our ENL teacher either provides additional resources for ELLs  or commits to finding them for student use.  A variety of suggestions of ENL modifications are made to content area teachers,  and often our ENL teacher will outline and model a QTEL (Quality Teaching to English Learners) task that would be appropriate  for the curriculum.  Teachers often discuss specific concerns they have with ELL students in their classrooms within Teacher  Teams.The time spent on articulation and professional development far exceeds the mandatory 7.5 hours required by the  Department of Education. Records of these meetings are maintained by the ENL teacher/Bilingual Coordinator and stored  alongside student data in the ENL classroom/office.    QTEL PD is provided to an ELA/ESL and Special ED teacher that will support in sharing the instructional strategies and resources  with the rest of staff.     During these meetings, curriculum and resources are discussed.  Our ENL teacher provides additional resources for ELLs. A  variety of suggestions of ENL modifications are made to content area teachers that are appropriate for the  curriculum.  Teachers often discuss specific concerns they having with ELL students in their classrooms. Professional  development will be provided by school staff and organizations and trainers in workshops coordinated by the New York City  Department of English Language Learners.    Non pedagogic staff is invited to PDs on Fridays where they are able to also receive PD aligned to supporting ELLs as the  engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. Staff is also invited to PDs outside the building that will support them in their  current duties as they work with the ELL students.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Within the schools Professional Development program, the focus is on:  o     Familiarizing staff with language proficiency levels, ELL identification procedures, and ELL scaffolds.  o     Collaboration and conferencing between content area teachers and our ENL instructor.  o     Communication of ENL strategies and methods through electronic and written memoranda.  All pertinent information from these trainings are presented at faculty or department meetings.    The required ELL Professional Development is included in the Professional Development Plan. The PD plan is a collaborative  effort where targeted professional development is determined to meet the needs of teachers specifically geared towards  supporting the ENL population and to ensure that the required amount of PD is provided as per the CR part 154.2              2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?             There are parent workshops setup for the 2017-2018 calendar school year which includes various topics concerning  ELLs . Parent workshops will be held on Saturdays from 9:00-2:00pm. Parents will be invited in both English and Spanish letters  sent home and phone calls will be conducted when necessary. Individual meetings will be setup by the guidance counselor,  ENL instructor or Bilingual Coordinator to continue to inform parents of language development progress, assessments results  and requirements and needs of improvement towards graduation.     During the annual individual meetings with the parents, reports of Language proficiency results, the progress of language  development and students needs concerning content area are discussed with the parents.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The parents of our ELL students are involved with and supportive of their children's education.  They are readily available by  phone, and are easily contacted by the parent coordinator and the guidance counselor, who are both bilingual. Many of them,  however, are not available to participate in school events due to work constraints.    All parents are invited to participate in the Parent Teacher Association. They are also invited to outings on weeknights or  weekends (performances, etc).  Parents have an open invitation to attend any field trip the ENL class takes during the school  day. We will also have cultural celebrations as part of the Bilingual Program where parents are invited to celebrate diversity in  Legal Studies.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rosemary Vega, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   East Williamsburg Scholars Aca                                                                              School DBN: 14K477  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication.
