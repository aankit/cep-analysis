This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview      P.S. 86 Vision       Inspiring Minds   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Fostering Social-Emotional Intelligence   Empowering Achievement   Growing Collaborative Culture      P.S. 86 Mission Statement   We dare to inspire our students to develop the skills to become independent thinkers and creative problem solvers.   We care to foster the social, emotional and intellectual growth of our school community.       We prepare and empower our students to become responsible 21st century citizens in a diverse global society.       We share collective responsibility in growing an atmosphere of cooperation with respect for individual differences  and community values.    .       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Some examples of how our teachers have spent their year working collaboratively are:    ● All of our teachers continue to engage in inquiry-based professional collaborations to develop and implement  practices shared within a grade or a discipline embedding Common Core Learning Standards and the instructional  shifts. Teams are structured into professional learning communities (PLCs), professional learning teams (PLTs), and  “branch-offs” where teachers come together as a subset of a larger team to engage in a cycle of inquiry. All  collaborations are guided by the use of protocols such as the Critical Friends protocol in order to analyze student work  and strengthen teacher capacity. Several teachers designed their own PLT groups and developed the topics with their  colleagues, bringing professional learning to a whole new level.    ● By choosing to continue to focus on our bilingual and ELL program in particular, we spent the past several years  establishing an ongoing partnership with the team from CUNY-NYSIEB (New York State Initiative on Emergent  Bilinguals). Many of our ELL and bilingual teachers attended CUNY-NYSIEB seminars to enhance their understanding of  best practices that support bilingual instruction and the implications of the CCLS for emergent bilingual students. They  then came back to their classrooms, armed with “translanguaging” strategies and were able to use bilingualism as a  resource in order to make content comprehensible for emergent bilingual students. These teachers ultimately created  the Emergent Bilingual Team, sharing best practices and examining student work on a monthly basis.       During the 2016-2017 school-year we expanded the ELL work by way of the Advanced Literacies Institute- an  initiative from the Chancellor's Office, that included superintendents, principals, and other key stakeholders. As  part of this work we created the P.S.86 Advanced Literacies Team (ALT)     Key players from the EBT and ENL team   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10        This new group of teachers, coaches, and administrators will be key for putting into practice the work from   the institute.     Reflecting on our core   o  To begin to strengthen our core, the ALT had to reflect and assess it using the institute’s 5 Hallmarks   of instruction.    o  We used these Hallmarks to reflect on our curriculum and instructional practices. We closely looked   at how our curriculum and instruction matched up to each Hallmark and to what extend.      Institute’s Main Takeaway   o  Strengthening the Instructional Core-jour day-to-day particulars of instruction  o  Our Instructional Core: Ready Gen, Focused Leveled Reading, Wilson-Fundations  o  By attacking improving literacy rates through strengthening the core we can make the most impact  because students spend up to 20 hours per week engaged in the core. (Lesaux, 2016). It just makes  sense to attack it from there!   The following examples are evidence of teachers having the opportunity to work closely with their colleagues and  community organizations to provide their students with access to challenging and exciting curricular materials.    ● We have had a long-standing relationship with Teach For America and for eight years hosted their Summer  Institute, a summer school program for students in grades Pre-K through six. In Summer 2015, we initiated a  collaboration with the New York City Teaching Fellows and will continue this partnership in 2018-2019, again hosting  their summer school program for P.S. 86 students in grades Pre-K through 6.    ● Junior Achievement has collaborated with P.S. 86 for more than ten years, working with students in grades K-6. As  part of this program, students engage in a day’s worth of financial literacy activities.   ● We have well established relationships with several art residency programs throughout New York City. Those we  worked with during the 2017-2018 school year include:   ■ Guggenheim’s “Learning Through Art”   ■ Lehman College   ■ The Rubin Museum of Art   ■ MoMA   ■ The New York City Children’s Theater   ■ The Metropolitan Museum of Art   ■ Music Wizards (Recorder instrument residency)   ■ Community Works, Inc. (Music residency)            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      P.S. 86, the Kingsbridge Heights School, is located in the north central Bronx and is comprised of more than 1,700  students in grades Pre-K through six. As one of the largest elementary schools in the United States, P.S. 86 serves a  primarily Hispanic community (85%), including more than 500 English Language Learners (31%) and 336 Students with  Disabilities (20%).      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools element Collaborative Teachers is the area where we have made the most progress  over the several years. Built on the basis of Trust and with the support of Effective School Leadership, we have spent a  significant amount of time integrating the concept of Collaborative Teachers into the P.S. 86 community. A key  component has been to put our teachers on the cutting edge of curriculum innovation and the art and science of  teaching.   Combining the elements of Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Strong Family-Community Ties, is the  wealth of school-wide collaborations that have been established and integrated into the P.S. 86 community. As we  look ahead, our key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year will continue to be Rigorous Instruction, primarily in  the use of formative assessment to provide actionable feedback to students.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X086   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1669   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

SQR specific feedback    Indicator 2.2 - “Impact: Although the school uses common assessments include checks for understanding in lessons,  and provide actionable feedback that result in teachers determining student progress towards goals and adjusting  instruction, meaningful feedback is inconsistently used to promote greater student initiative to progress towards the  next level.”   Based on the Schoolwide Needs Assessment Survey 2017 feedback, and teacher feedback from June 2018:   Last year our staff identified the gap in students' use of grade appropriate academic vocabulary both in speaking and  writing as a barrier to success. This was based on teacher observation of students' oral use of vocabulary in classroom  conversations, as well as students' use of grade level academic vocabulary in student writing samples. As a result for  the 2017-2018 school year all K-6 classes began a systematic routine of grade level academic vocabulary word study  and daily practice to address this need. Our staff adopted a words-of-the-week approach to teaching and modeling  these academic vocabulary words by way of explicit instruction, systematic practice, and review and deep processing.  Based on teacher survey feedback of student use of academic vocabulary words, significant increases in vocabulary  use were reported in classrooms across all grades. Teachers shared best practices and student success in adopting  and using this new grade level academic vocabulary in conversation (grades K-6). Furthermore, teachers in grades 2-6  reviewed student writing samples- constructed response writing as well as midline and endline writing samples- to  identify student use of academic vocabulary use on writing. Teachers across all grades reported a significant increase  in the written use of these words.   Based on the nature of the academic vocabulary initiative that was implemented during the 2017-2018, we strongly  believe this initiative must be continued each year so that students can gain exposure and practice to new academic  vocabulary words at their grade level to support their growth in content area knowledge. This year, 2018-2019 we  plan to continue supporting this in some of the following ways:      Continue to share best practices in teaching and promoting student use of general academic vocabulary in      discussions  continue using our predetermined lists of grade level academic vocabulary words to support academic  discussion     Embed talk and discussion opportunities across content areas, and regularly reflect on student use of   academic vocabulary in conversation (in school and at home) and in writing.       Continue to assess students' ongoing use of academic vocabulary in classroom conversations   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14           Continue to assess students' use of academic vocabulary in written form through analysis of student   constructed responses and midline and endline writing tasks      Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

All teachers will continue to use daily talk and discussion routines to support students in acquiring and using a  predetermined set of grade level general academic vocabulary words that will be displayed and referenced in every  classroom. At each grade level, students will engage in daily oral and written practice with their grade level vocabulary  words. All classes at each grade level will have used at least 90% of these words in conversation and/or writing by June  2019 as measured by their classroom “word of the week” word tracking system, which includes a weekly word reflection  display.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

According to the SY 17-18 PPO feedback from Superintendent Torres-Hulla, P.S. 86 has established a trustworthy  and positive school community that supports the academic and personal growth of students. She indicated that the  collaboration of staff, families and students and our participation in the RULER training was evident through our  school goals and vision.      2. A school wide needs assessment survey was administered to teachers in June 2018. The results of the survey  showed that teachers indicated a need a school wide program that would address the social emotional well-being of  students and teach conflict resolution and self regulation strategies. P.S. 86 has chosen to adopt the RULER approach  which is born out of Yale's Center for Emotional Intelligence. RULER is an evidence-based approach for integrating  social and emotional learning into schools. RULER teaches the skills of emotional intelligence (recognizing,  understanding, labeling, expressing and regulating emotions) through the use of four anchor tools, the Charter, Mood  Meter, Meta-moment, and Blueprint.       3. Our school currently supports children through our Be Kind Pledge, Service in Schools Committee, Respect for All,  conflict resolution with guidance counselors and administration and most recently the implementation of the RULER  approach, the social emotional learning program.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   2017-18 School Quality Guide–Data    Rigorous Instruction-Priority Needs     69% of students say that teachers ask difficult questions in class.     66% of students say that they work in small groups.     89% of teachers say that students have to work hard to do well.     77% of teachers say that students respond to challenging test questions.     75% of teachers say that students respond to challenging questions in class.    Our 2017-18 School Quality Guide tells the story of teachers noticing that a large population of our students are  consistently unresponsive to challenging content and questioning. Additionally, our students do not feel that teachers  plan for opportunities for small group work. Based on a 2018 PS 86 teacher survey, 78% of our students continue to  struggle with specific behaviors, i.e., persistence, communication among peers, and engagement across all subject  areas.    This priority needs that will be addressed are student persistence, student-to-student communication/discussion, and  the social-emotional context for developing this skills in all academic areas. This priority will be addressed by  educating our teachers in collaborative horizontal and vertical teams on how the Growth Mindset impacts student  success in these areas. This goal looks to help both teachers and students understand that they both have the ability  to learn, and that intelligence itself can increase with the application of effort and effective strategies, as  demonstrated by neuroscience and cognitive research. Working in teacher teams, our teachers will learn the theory  behind how growth mindsets can improve persistence in the face of rigorous challenges and the development of  other academic and personal behaviors (i.e., working together) that lead to an array of positive outcomes for  students. Our teachers will understand how classroom environment and teacher practices influence the development  and expression of positive mindsets, habits, and skills in school, and have the opportunity to test out effective  classroom and school-level strategies that nurture growth mindsets. Together they will focus on how to teach  students about growth mindset, how to use growth-oriented language to frame feedback and instruction, and how to  embed structures in classrooms that support positive mindsets.    This goal relies heavily on whole-school understanding, learning, and implementation. This is a collaborative effort,  where teachers must work together to shift our school culture.

PS 86 has been using Personal and Academic Success rubrics in all classrooms since 2015 to support the behaviors  that are essential for success in (and out of) school. Based on a 2018 PS 86 teacher survey, our students continue to  struggle with specific behaviors, i.e., persistence, communication among peers, and engagement across all subject  areas.       The power of a growth mindset can transform teaching and learning, but it also is critical for school leaders. A growth  mindset is not exclusive to teachers, students, and parents. In fact, school leaders with a growth mindset empower  the school and provide rich and sustaining learning opportunities for students and teachers. (7 Reasons School  Leaders Need a Growth Mindset, Ziegler 2017 Corwin Connect) Only 20 percent of teachers strongly believe they are  good at fostering a growth mindset in their own students. (Edweek Research Center 2016)      As part of our CEP for this year, our teachers will be studying and implementing the concepts articulated in The  Growth Mindset Coach(see section 4). In order to support and empower our teachers in establishing a growth  mindset, the administration needs to also study and implement the concepts articulated in the The Growth Mindet  Coach. Working in both an independent team and in teacher teams, our administrators will learn the theory behind  how growth mindsets can improve persistence in the face of rigorous challenges and the development of other  academic and personal behaviors that lead to an array of positive outcomes for students.      This goal relies heavily on whole-school understanding, learning, and implementation.

For example, students  can receive counseling, referrals to PATH, RTI services and Academic Intervention Services including afterschool,  Saturday Academy and Summer School. Our School Transportation Coordinator works with DOE staff at Temporary  Housing to provide busing and metrocards for eligible students. We organize a coat drive and provide eye glass  vouchers for students who need. We also work with parents to facilitate access to outside agencies such as Good  Shepherd, Salvation Army, and Home Base. Our Parent Coordinator and School Counseling Staff organize a variety of  workshops throughout the year to which all parents of STH are encouraged to attend. Our School Counseling staff  establishes relationships with the directors and DOE staff at Temporary Housing facilities in order to coordinate  services for STH and their families.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Strategies for recruitment:   ● P.S. 86 has a strong relationship with Teach for America (TFA). Many of our new teachers are hired from the Teach  for America corps.     P.S. 86 has hosted The New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) for the past three summers. Our teachers   have functioned as Cooperating Teachers/Mentors with the NYCTF and we actively recruit and hire Fellows  for teaching positions in the school   ● P.S. 86 hosts student teachers from Manhattan College. We recruit highly qualified candidates from this program.   Strategies for retention and support:   ● Coaches and administrators conduct a New Teacher Summer Orientation to introduce new teachers to the school  and our curriculum.   ● Each new teacher is assigned a mentor, who is an experienced classroom teacher, to assist with curriculum as well  as classroom management. Both Mentors and new teachers are trained in using the Danielson Framework as a tool  for success. New teacher progress is monitored through the New Teacher Mentoring Site.   ● Weekly New Teacher meetings are held by the coaches and school mentor to address the needs of new teachers.   New classroom teachers receive staff development in the areas of: test taking strategies, ongoing student  assessment, the P.S. 86x Curriculum calendars for all subject areas, and extensive training in examining student work  and classroom management.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● Administrative staff including the Principal and Assistant Principals attend District and BSFC meetings and  Professional Development sessions. As an outcome of this professional development, new programs are created or  existing programs are improved in order to increase student achievement. We are committed to providing an  educational environment that incorporates the most up-to-date research driven strategies and successful literacy and  math programs.   ● Teachers and paraprofessionals attend Professional Development sessions throughout the year focused on  curriculum development and alignment to the Common Core Learning Standards. Professional development is  provided by administration and coaches. The school's Professional Learning Team consists of teachers, administrators  and coaches. This team creates a yearlong calendar for Professional Learning that reflects the needs of the staff as  determined by the twice yearly needs assessment. Six week Professional Learning cycles are held during the Monday  Professional Learning Time and are continued at grade level meetings and other meetings scheduled during common  preps. Each cycle is followed by a share-out where the entire staff gathers to share what they have been learning  about teaching and learning and how this has resulted in increased student achievement.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  na        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  na                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  ● Kindergarten Orientation is held in June prior to a child's entrance into Kindergarten at P.S. 86. During this session,  parents are invited to the school to meet the Kindergarten Teachers. The Math and Literacy Coaches also provide an  introduction to the curriculum and learn more about the emotional/social transition their child will face from the  guidance counselor.   ● Our Response to Intervention Team (RTI) provides parents with resources for struggling Pre-K students so they can  receive early intervention services as needed.   ● Through the “Turning 5” process, IEP’s are generated for Pre-K students as needed as they transition to  Kindergarten.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ● Assessments are used to determine appropriate Kindergarten classroom setting (Bilingual, ESL or Monolingual)   ● The Pre-K curriculum (“Early Foundations” for ELA “Big Day” for Math which are both Common Core aligned)  prepares students to develop a sense of well-being and independence. It also increases children's language skills to  strengthen thinking skills that will help them solve problems.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     In compliance with the implementation of the new teacher evaluation (Advance), P.S. 86 formed a Measure    Student Learning Committee in June 2015. This team met to determine which assessments would be used for    the 40% portion of each teacher’s evaluation score. The committee presented their plan to the staff at a staff    meeting in October 2016. We will follow a similar process for school year 2018-2019.         A team was formed during the 2013-2014 school consisting of Teachers from K-6 and Administrators who    created a system of assessments and an assessment calendar which is currently being implemented across    the school. Each year Coaches, Teachers and Administrators evaluate and adjust our plan according to the    school’s needs. Teachers have played a key role in the creation of Common Core aligned Performance Based    Assessments for both ELA and Math in all grades (K-6) which are currently being integrated into our calendar.      Teachers and Teacher Teams score all student writing assessments (including the Baseline, MIdline and    Endline and PBAs) utilizing the 6+1 Traits of Writing rubric. Scores are analyzed and instructional groups are    formed in classrooms based on student need.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  5, 6     5, 6     5, 6     5,6     5, 6              1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 86, The Kingsbridge Heights School, in compliance with the Section 1118  of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 86, The Kingsbridge Heights School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology including the use of MyOn, Imagine Learning and Think Central   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children which includes "Back to School Nights" and workshops offered by  the school's Parent Coordinator   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress by providing time for parents to meet with teachers and communicating student progress in  written form through student data sheets distributed with report cards   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments which includes  workshops on curriculum and testing strategies   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand including frequent communication backpacked home to students in both  English and Spanish and use of School Messenger to call parents to relay important school-related information   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g. ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year  such as Math Bingo Nights and Literacy Nights   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Our goal is to  provide the supports our ELL students in the Transitional Bilingual Education program need in  order to achieve success in mastering the skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) needed  to show measurable progress and growth in the 5 language modalities as well as  in the  standardized and formative assessments they are  accountable for. The goal of the program is to  fuel a positive movement towards Advanced Literacy by holding our English Language Learners  (ELL) to the same high standards and expectations as their non ELL counterparts by providing  them with the language supports they need to access the curriculum.     Beginning in October and ending in May, about 100 students in bilingual education classes in  grades 1 through 6 will participate in an after-school program that will run two days a week for a  total of  110 hours.  The program will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:35 PM- 4:35 PM (55 x 2 x 7 x $55.23  = $42,527.10).  The curriculum and instruction used in this  program will be aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards, the New York State ENL  Standards, the new Bilingual Progression Standards, and Advanced Literacy.   The program will  consist of an intensive reading and writing curriculum in which 15 to 20 students per class will  have the opportunity to strengthen and refine English language skills.   Six certified bilingual education teachers will commit to exploring and  implementing Advanced  Literacy instructional strategies to help prepare struggling students to be academically and  personally successful in today's literacy-and knowledge-based society which requires that all  students develop skills and competencies that enable communication in increasingly diverse  ways with increasingly divers audiences.  Teachers will determine the amount of time devoted to  instruction in each of the language modalities depending on students’ NYSESLAT proficiency  level, Fountas and Pinnell reading level, and the students’ ability to work with high utility  words.  The program embeds the expectation that all students, regardless of needs, can be  successful.  Students will be exposed to both their Native (NL) and English language (EL) in  order to increase and enhance not only their vocabulary skills, but their oral, listening, reading,  and writing skills, in both languages.    In addition, students will also participate in a writing academy where they will continue to  explore the structures and features good writers use when writing with a purpose via series of  connected extended writing experiences.   An emphasis on the use of the 6+1 traits of writing  will be a secondary goal. The academy will incorporate technology as an educational tool.  Groups of students will have scheduled times throughout the program to visit the computer lab  where one technology teacher, in collaboration with each individual certified bilingual teacher in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   the program, will work with students to improve their reading and writing by using programs like  Imagination Learning,  MYON, Ticket to Read, and  Microsoft Word.   The technology  teacher  and each bilingual teacher will meet to plan every other week during a common prep  period. Students will use these programs to read and engage with text at their independent  reading level and answer comprehension questions.  Both the technology teacher and the  classroom teacher support the students in mastering the various reading and extended writing  tasks embedded in the programs.  In addition, students also have the opportunity to visit the lab  to work on their revision and editing skills while they craft the extended writing pieces.  One of  the final projects of the program consists of each student crafting one piece of writing and taking  it through the writing process.  Each student will publish his/her piece using one of the writing  structures explored during the program.  During this time, each class uses the technology lab  benefiting from working with the technology teacher and the classroom teacher work in  small groups.    Students will also visit our library to borrow books, read independently or read with a partner on  a regular basis.  Finally, each teacher will administer an assessment in reading and writing for  each student to  determine their reading and writing growth and to assess the achievement of program related  objectives and goals.      55 x 2 x 7 x 55.23 = $42,527.10   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                Prior to the commencement of the program six bilingual teachers will participate in a two-hour  (2:35-4:35 pm), five day (late September 2018 ) seminar (led by the  bilingual/ELL coordinator) to become proficient in understanding, assessing, planning and  implementing each component of the reading and writing academy. They will engage in a book  study using English Language Learners Day by Day by Christina Celic. Via the book study,  teachers will engage in discussions and exploration of effective practices and strategies that  can  help impact literacy success for ELLs.  The book offers teachers concrete ideas to help  students in bilingual classes reach high levels of biliteracy in both Spanish and  English.  Bilingual teachers will use  the book to craft lessons for use not only within the after  school reading and writing academy, but also during our regular school day.  Teachers will also  engage (in a book study format) with the text Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills by Nonie K.  Lesaux to familiarize themselves with sections of the text that will be used to impact unit  planning for the program.     In addition, the six teachers will revisit the components of the writing workshop model and use  Reading, Writing and Learning in ESL by Suzanne F. Peregoy to study and discuss the  developmental phases in second language writing and develop writing lessons implementing  strategies to assist writers of different levels.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62            Part C: Professional Development   At the end of the program, teachers will come together to create a resource guide of lessons and  work samples used throughout the program.

Parents will be notified about the program by means of fliers that will be sent home  with the students, by announcements made during the Parent Association monthly meetings, via  phone blast.  Enrollment will be opened until both classes are filled.   The instructors for this  class are certified bilingual education teachers, Ms. Hechavarria and Ms. Velazquez.  The classes  will begin in November and run through May on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 5:30 PM-8:30  PM.  Two weekly lesson plans will be prepared based on the history of the United States of  America. Classes will be instructed in both English and Spanish.    The goal of this program is to help those individuals who are interested in becoming American  citizens pass the New York State Citizenship exam. In addition, we hope to help newcomers  understand United States laws. Our ESL component will consist of a pre and post oral  presentation and writing sample with an emphasis on oral language development, phonics, basic  vocabulary and rules of grammar needed to communicate in daily real life situations.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school assesses the early literacy skills of our ELLs using Estrellita,  Fountas and Pinnell in  English and Spanish, and EDL. Each assessment tool provides teachers a baseline to drive instruction.  The data collected from  the assessments is used to plan lessons and units that meet the needs of ELLs.  Coaches and teachers work collaboratively to  establish reasonable goals and expectations for our school's instructional plan at each grade level.  Fountas & Pinnell is our  English leveled reading assessment designed to assess student’s instructional and independent reading level. This assessment  is also given 3 times per year- fall, winter, and spring- and is used to support teachers in working with students to set personal  reading goals. Teachers also use this data to instruct students in guided reading. Teachers administer the F&P Spanish  assessment in the fall, to help them determine student’s literacy level in their native language.  Teachers use this information  to select books for whole-group and small-group (guided reading, literature circles) instruction, as well as to assist students in  selecting texts for independent reading.  The data generated from the assessments is then compiled into a whole-school  snapshot of our students' reading abilities in comparison to grade-level benchmarks.  This allows us to prioritize students,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      classrooms, and grades that require professional development, resources, or additional personnel to assist in meeting the  needs of the students.   In addition, the data allows the school to reflect on current and past practices and tailor the  instructional plan to maximize student learning and reading growth.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have several structures to support our assessment efforts.  Each year the school administrative team creates a publishes  an assessment calendar.  This calendar provides all the information a teacher and student would need to regarding the  assessments (dates, timeline, documentation, etc.).  In addition, the assessment calendar is also made available via the  school's Google doc.  Student data is tracked via an electronic tracker that teachers complete and submit for school historical  data collection and analysis.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELA Summative Assessments  ELA NYC Performance Series provides a baseline of evidence based writing from sources allowing teachers to plan accordingly  for differentiated instruction in grade level reading, sharing opinions, command of evidence, organization and conventions  throughout the school year based on individual student and class performance.    Our baseline. midline, and endline writing assessment (in both English and Spanish) provide teachers with both individual  student and whole class data based on the 7 traits of writing- ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency,  conventions and presentation.  These assessments are administered 3 times a year- fall, winter and spring. This data tracks  writing proficiency across the 7 traits, and allows teachers to focus their analysis on specific areas of strengths and needs in  writing. Teachers then work with individual groups of students to support their development in different traits.     Math Summative Assessments  Math NYC Performance Series provides a baseline of the major works of each grade allowing teachers to plan accordingly for  differentiated instruction throughout the school year based on individual student and class performance.    GO Math! Chapter tests (in both English and Spanish) provide teachers with both individual student and whole class  data.  These assessments are administered at the end of each math chapter.  This data tracks progress and mastery of math  chapter Common Core learning standards.  Teachers analyze this information and highlight areas of strengths and  needs.  Teachers then work with individual groups of students to reteach these specific standards.     Math Problem Solving Assessments are administered three times yearly in both English and Spanish.  Teachers track this  information and analyze student performance to plan for the Cooperative Problem Solving session in between each  assessment.      Each assessment tool provides teachers a baseline to drive instruction.  The data collected from the assessments is used to  plan lessons and units that meet the needs of our  ELLs.  Coaches and teachers work collaboratively to establish reasonable  goals and expectations for our school's instructional plan at each grade level.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, the administration, coaches, and teacher teams analyze the data and use it to  set goals at the school, grade, classroom, and individual student level.  The data is used at the classroom level to form flexible  student groups and provide tiers of interventions.  Tier I interventions are provided at the classroom level via flexible  grouping.  Tier II interventions are provided outside of the classroom by the AIS provider.  While a student receives Tier II  interventions, he/she also receives small group reinforcement in the classroom.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         The data generated from the the formative and summative assessments is compiled into a whole-school snapshot of our  students reading and math abilities in comparison to grade-level benchmarks.  This allows us to prioritize students, classrooms,  and grades that require professional development, resources, or additional personnel to assist in meeting the needs of our  ELL  students.   In addition, the data allows the school to reflect on current and past practices and tailor the instructional plan  and teacher practice to maximize student learning and growth. Using the F&P data teachers identify students who are most in  need of academic intervention services (Tier 2 support).  Daily Tier 2 intervention is provided for each of these students by an  AIS provider, and their progress is tracked through routine Progress Monitoring, teacher-student conferences, and teacher  observations.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   To evaluate and inform our ELL programs, we utilize the results of various assessments such as the following:  NYSITELL (results show the proficiency level a new admit is starting from).      NYSESLAT (shows the progress in language proficiency students have made each year)  In the year 2017,  the NYSESLAT was administered to 469 students.  Of those 469 students, 20 scored on the commanding  level. 107 of those students advanced 1 proficiency level, 17 advanced 2 proficiency levels, 1 advanced 3 proficiency levels and  190 remained at the same proficiency level.  Area of concern***    ELA (Students who score Expanding on the NYSESLAT and a 3 or 4 on the ELA are able to test out of ELL status.  6 students met  this criteria in the 2017 school year.      Our ELLs tend to perform better in the listening and speaking modalities of the NYSESLAT, however they  struggle most  in the  reading and writing modalities, especially in grades 2-6.  We have made instructional shifts based on this data analysis.  Our  ENL push-in and pull-out teachers will focus mostly in those areas to expose, encourage, and challenge our ELLs to read and  write based on text and picture analysis.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The administrative team, coaches, and teacher teams analyze the data and use it to set goals at the school, grade, classroom,  and individual student level.  At grade level and content level team meetings, coaches and supervisors meet with teachers to  discuss the data, note trends, and plan for instructional and curricular adjustments in order to better meet the needs of the  students based on the data.  Furthermore, teacher teams meet during common planning time to look closer at the data and  continue to make instructional adjustments.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   To meet the needs of our English Language Learners, Public School 86 offers a self contained push-in ENL program  available in every grade from K-6.  The model consists of heterogeneous grouping where students of mixed  proficiency levels are placed together in their corresponding grade level classes.  English as a New Language (ENL) is a  major component of the ENL program (integrated and standalone ENL).  Instruction is strategically designed to  develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Students in  the self contained ENL program, receive  Integrated ENL instruction in the content area by a certified ENL teacher in collaboration with the classroom teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         (content area teacher).  Students are grouped according to their English proficiency levels as per their  NYSESLAT scores and are provided with the appropriate number of minutes of integrated ENL (with native language  support as needed) as per CR Part 154.      The Freestanding ENL program also provides students with a specified amount of Standalone  ENL.  This instruction is  provided by the certified ENL teacher using both the push-in and/or pull-out model.  The goal of this model is to  develop students' English language skills in all the modalities to help them succeed in all core content classes.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     To meet the needs of our English Language Learners, Public School 86 offers a self contained Spanish transitional  bilingual program in every grade from K-6, including Special Education in grades 6. The model consists of  heterogeneous grouping where students of mixed proficiency levels are placed together in their corresponding grade  level classes.  English as a New Language is a major component of the Transitional Bilingual program.   Instruction is  strategically designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  Students in the Transitional  Bilingual program including SWD's receive instruction from New York State Certified Bilingual Education Teachers in  both the home and new language. The goal of the bilingual program is to gradually transition students into English- only instruction. The primary language (Spanish) is used to support the transition.  In the  bilingual program, students are taught at least two content subject areas (such as Math and Social Studies or  Science)  in their native language at earlier levels of proficiency along with both integrated and standalone ENL  instruction provided by the certified bilingual teachers. Content area (Math, Science and Social Studies) instruction is  predominantly in the native language (Spanish), however they also receive integrated ENL through the same content  areas plus one unit of Home Language Arts.  The TBE program also provides students with a specified amount of  Standalone ENL instruction, as mandated in the CR Part 154.  This instruction is provided by the certified bilingual  teacher in the classroom.  Support in the home language is provided based on students’ English proficiency  level.  Students receive grade level appropriate work which helps them meet New York State Common Core  Standards. This model of instruction and allocation of language helps them make academic progress in the content  areas while they develop English proficiency.   ***   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   To ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model,  PS 86  follows the standalone and integrated  ENL program  and  Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) program for grades  Kindergarten to Sixth. ENL students are placed in the same class on each grade level and ENL services are provided by a  certified ENL teacher who pushes in and pulls out depending on the needs of the student.  In 1st, 3  rd, and 6  th   grade, there  are ENL certified teachers who have a self-contained ENL class.  In compliance with CR part 154 regulation and alignment with  new Bilingual Progression levels,  students at the entering level will receive a total of 360  minutes of ENL instruction (180  minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL).  Students at the emerging level will receive a total of  360  minutes  of ENL instruction (90 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL with a flexible 90 minutes  provided either standalone or integrated).   Students at the Transitioning level will receive  a total 180 minutes of ENL  instruction (90 minutes of integrated and 90 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction).  Students at the expanding level will receive a  total of 180 minutes of only integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  Students are the commanding level will receive 90 minutes  of standalone ENL with ELA or any other content area explicit ENL weekly.     The breakdown of the time allotment for instruction in the TBE program is slightly different for students due to the home  language arts component.  In order for students in the TBE program to access the new Common Core aligned ELA curriculum,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      which now offers paired units in English and Spanish, we continue to follow a hybrid version of the 50-50 model of instruction  in literacy.  Within this model, students receive literacy instruction in both English and Spanish on an alternating basis (1 unit is  entirely in Spanish and the next unit is in English).  During the English unit, text is made accessible and comprehensible to  students by means of partial translation of text, chunking of text,  and the use of Translanguaging  strategies.  Translanguaging strategies are used as a scaffold to help TBE students access text and concepts when instruction is  in English while helping them acquire English language skills.  These strategies are also used as a way to cultivate students’  bilingualism using their language repertoire as a resource for learning (reading, writing, listening and speaking) in the literacy  classroom.  With the use of both languages students take notes about their reading in both languages and discuss what they  are learning in both languages. The use of the languages by both students and teachers varies depending on the students’  English proficiency level.  For example, an emerging or entering student will rely more on his/her home language to make  content comprehensible during the English unit when using all four language modalities while the teacher strategically threads  ENL strategies to meet the mandated 360 minutes a week of instruction.  In addition, the teacher will make language  modifications to her instruction to help meet individual students’ language needs both in ENL and HLA both during whole and  small group instruction.   In a bilingual classroom, mini lesson’s alternate between English and Spanish. Key vocabulary and  syntax is developed in both languages side by side.  With independent and guided reading, there’s a combination of both  English and Spanish.  Under this 50-50 model of instruction, teachers strategically embed language modifications into their  instruction.  TBE students not only meet the mandated time allocation for ENL, HLA and ELA instruction, they surpass it due to  the week by week alternation of languages.  All  instruction in this program (TBE) is delivered by certified bilingual classroom  teachers.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Delivery of content area instruction varies slightly in each program model.  In the TBE program, the goal is to help  students meet content area (math, science and social studies) language  standards by means of the knowledge transfer  approach.  In this approach, students receive content area instruction mostly in in the native language so that they can  transfer the knowledge acquired as their English proficiency increases.  The dominant language is used 60-80 percent of the  time in the early stages of English proficiency.  For example, a student at the emerging and entering levels will receive math,  science and social studies instruction in the home language with  some instructional time via integrated ENL in such subjects to  help build English language skills through the content area.              To teach math we use the common core aligned Go Math program offered in the home language.  Go Math is a K-8  program that offers an engaging and interactive approach to covering the new state standards, its seamless digital path and  write-in Student Edition ensure that students can access content at appropriate levels of depth and rigor in their home  language.   However, as the student progresses to the transitioning and expanding  English proficiency levels, content area  instruction in science and social studies gradually shifts to English.  At these levels,  students receive 90-180 minutes of  integrated ENL instruction via these content areas.   At each stage, content is made comprehensible by means of a variety of  resources used both in the students' home language-when in the beginning stages of English language development-and in the  second language-when in the later stages of English language development.                    Hartcourt science and social studies programs are available to all students both in English and Spanish, if in TBE program  and in English only if in the Free Standing ENL program.  Hartcourt Social Studies is a comprehensive curriculum solution  designed to engage and motivate every student.  Through stories of the intriguing people, exciting places, and fascinating  events that make social studies relevant to their lives, students gain a global perspective.   Hartcourt Science education  programs encourage students to explore the world around them.  All content area instruction delivered via Integrated ENL is  supported with ENL methods and strategies.   Students are provided with dictionaries and glossaries and a sleud of online  resources including Brain Pop, Discovery Science, Imagine Learning, and MyOn.               Simillary, the goal of the Freestanding ESL program is to help ELLs meet the expectations of common core content area  and language demands by means of  (math, science and social studies) and language standards by means of the SIOP   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      model.  The SIOP model is a research-based and validated model of shelter instruction.  Through this model, classroom  teachers-with the help and support of the ENL teachers plan and deliver lessons that allow ELLs to acquire academic  knowledge as they develop English language proficiency using the Integrated ENL model.    ELLs in the Freestanding  classes  also have access to Go Math, Hartcourt Science and Social Studies, Ready Gen and CodeX, dictionaries and glossaries, online  resources and technology.  Each classroom is equipped with a smartboard and the necessary software for teachers to make  content lessons more interactive and engaging for students.              In all programs the use of Translanguaging  strategies plays an important role in providing ELLs multiple entry points to the  curriculum and programs. Translanguaging provides a way of ensuring that Emergent Bilingual(EB) students receive the  rigorous instruction that will allow them to meet Common Core Learning Standards, even when their English language  proficiency is not fully developed.  In fact, the theory of Translanguaging fits well with the theory of language as an action that  is contained in the Common Core Learning Standards.  This strategy offers EB students the possibility of being able to gather,  comprehend, evaluate, synthesize and report on information and ideas using text based evidence; engage with complex text,  not only literary but informational; and write to persuade, explain and convey real or imaginary experience even as their  English is developing.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      We ensure that ENL students are appropriately evaluated in their native language as well as in English. ENL students in  grades K-3 are administered the Spanish Fountas and Pinnell and grades 4-6 are administered the Spanish DRA (EDL) reading  assessments.  These assessments are administered three times during the year (September, January and May) to determine  the students native language independent and instructional levels. In addition, teachers also administer a writing baseline,  midline and endline to measure each students' native language writing proficiency. ENL students in a bilingual program who  receive content area instruction in Spanish are administered school and state assessments in the language they received  instruction in (Spanish).  Math and science examinations are ordered in Spanish for our bilingual classes, including Bilingual  Special Education classes. Bilingual glossaries are available during testing to support our second language learners.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     At P.S. 86 we understand how important and impactful differentiating instruction for ELLs is, especially when they are  expected to meet the goals and state standards just as their English-only counterparts.  Various interventions are offered by  the school to all ELLs, including the special education students to improve their linguistic and academic abilities so they meet  New York State Common Core Learning Standards promotional/graduation requirements.     a.  Students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) are provided services based on their individual needs.  Academic  intervention services are provided using Voyager Passport (Grades K-2) and Soar to Success (grades 3-6). Voyager is a  comprehensive reading intervention program that meets the needs of all struggling readers. Through explicit introduction of  priority skills, struggling readers access increasingly complex text.  Soar to Success is a research based reading intervention  program designed for students in grades 3-8 who are reading significantly below grade level.  It is a small group model that  uses motivating literature, respecter teaching, and graphic organizers and fast paced lessons to help these students accelerate  their reading growth. Small group instruction is also provided by ENL teachers to improve their listening, speaking, reading and  writing skills to become English proficient using programs such as, Moving Into English, Avenues, and English at Your  Command. These programs offer research-based and standards based instruction in English and language arts.  These  programs are designed for English learners and struggling readers in Grades K-6 to accelerate growth in language, literacy, and  content. Using carefully selected literature selections in both fiction and non fiction, instruction proceeds from building  vocabulary and language to understanding the fundamentals of reading (phonemic awareness, phonics and decoding),   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      development of comprehension skills, writing, and application in content area studies.      In addition all SIFE are given the opportunity to attend an after school program and/or Saturday Academy. The programs  support an intensive reading and writing instruction academy in which ten to twelve students per class develop reading and  writing skills through an interrupted quality of time. The program is designed to increase students’ English vocabulary and  English skills; oral, listening, reading, and writing. Our school is also using MyON, a complete literacy program that reinvents  student reading. This program offers students access to thousands of award winning digital books, recommends content to  readers at their interest and at their reading level. It also offers features such as, spoken word audio to model fluency,  sentence highlighting, and an embedded dictionary. Teachers are able to track how much time each child spends reading, the  number of books read, their reading growth, and much more.  Teachers of ELLs also use a program known as Imagine Learning  which is a technology program.  It is an award-winning language and literacy software program that features interactive  activities, videos, and games. It’s research-based, instructionally differentiated, and incredibly fun to use.  It has been an  amazing tool for our newcomers especially.  Another program accessible to SIFEs is Reading Plus, a program designed to help  improve students' ability to read silently.       b.  Newcomers are pulled out by an ENL certified teacher to work on basic listening and speaking English skills and help them  with the assimilation and acclimation process.  The goal is not only to make the student feel comfortable in a new school  culture, but also to address their language needs in a more private and focused setting.  Some of the methods and strategies  used with newcomers include: TPR (Total Physical Response), Alternate Language Approach, Cognitive Academic Response,  role play, accessing prior knowledge, Natural Approach, sheltered English and whole language. The ENL teacher uses various  programs and approaches to help meet the needs of the students, such as Moving Into English and English at Your  Command.  Newcomers are allowed to use their home  language in their classroom in order to make them confident when  participating in class discussions and producing written work.    c.  Developing ELLs receive small group instruction with a certified ENL teacher as well as Academic Intervention Services  (AIS).  ENL instructors utilize programs such as English at Your Command, Avenues, Moving into English, Wilson Reading  System, Wilson Just Words, and Reading Plus.  These programs are designed to enhance students’ English proficiency in  phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, comprehension skills, writing, and application in content area studies.     d. Long Term ELLs are provided with “at risk” resource room, IEP mandated resource room, and/or AIS. Teachers in the  resource room design  instructional supports that meet the specific needs of the students they service in order to maximize  their learning potential. The resource room teachers work closely with the classroom teachers and the parents to ensure the  support provided is indeed helping the ELL student reach their full potential. Students in resource room are usually assessed  and tested in the resource room as it provides a less distracting environment and have a better chance at success.     e.  Former ELLs continue to receive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) until adequate progress is made (determined by  classroom teacher and/or standardized exam scores.) In addition, these students are offered after school programs, and  Saturday Academy to support them in reading and math. They receive extended test accommodations for two additional years  after achieving proficiency on the NYSESLAT. This provides former ELLs an opportunity to demonstrate their content  knowledge while they continue to develop their linguistic and academic skills.  Former ELLs continue to receive at least one  half of one unit of study of English as a new language (90 minutes per week) by a certified ENL teacher.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           There are a variety of instructional strategies used by teachers to enable ELLs - SWDs  access to academic content areas  and accelerate English language development.   Within the classroom there is cooperative learning which enables ELLs- SWDs  to be active learners.  Using flexible grouping allows these students to interact with their English speaking  peers.  Differentiated instruction is highly used throughout all grades as an effective teaching strategy.  This type of instruction  provides opportunities for visual, verbal linguistic, and tactile kinesthetic learners to apply their strength when learning. The  use of hands-on activities, demonstrations, and use of technology such as the Smart Board, CDs, cassettes, and videos are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      utilized to supplement instruction in the content areas.  Grade level materials include components from the programs used to  accelerate English language development such as English at Your Command, Avenues, and Moving into English.  The  development of vocabulary is essential to language development because it makes content more comprehensible to English  language learners. Vocabulary is explicitly taught through several programs such as, Words your Way, Elements of Vocabulary,  and Rev it Up. ELL learners will have access to the new Common Core aligned ELA curriculum.   The ENL strategies used to  adapt this curriculum will create entry points for ELL students to access grade level ELA curriculum and task, as well as  providing them with comprehensible input and output.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Teachers at our school are given curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELLs - SWDs  within the least restrictive environment. Teachers in grades K-6 use ReadyGEN.  These students are provided additional  support in other ways.  Instruction is data driven.  Teachers create small groups of students to work with based on their  performance on assessments and informal teacher-student conferences and observations.  Students with similar needs are  grouped together to receive additional reinforcement during small group instruction.  These groups vary and change according  to content.   Academic Intervention Services are in place and designed to help students achieve the learning standards in  English Language Arts.  Students who receive these services are recommended by the classroom teacher.  The provider works  along with the teacher to create a schedule that accommodates the child providing the ultimate instructional time.  AIS  providers articulate monthly with classroom teachers during a common prep and also participate in data meetings held by  grade level supervisors and coaches.  Certified ENL instructors,  Mrs. Calderon and Mrs. Garcia also provide flexible instruction  and scheduling by pushing into the classroom and provide services to help these students' listening, speaking, reading, and  writing skills.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Small group instruction is provided by certified ENL teachers, Mrs. Calderon and Mrs. Garcia who work to improve students’  listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.  Students will increase English proficient using various programs with specific  groups.  Moving into English is a flexible, easy-to-use program that provides teachers with language-rich resources to help in  the enhancement of Entering students' language acquisition. Each lesson is divided into three simple steps: Talk About it, Read  About it, and Write About it. This adaptable program focuses on Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Language Exploration,  Comprehension, and Fluency. The Hampton-Brown Avenues Series  is a standards-based reading and language arts program,  designed to promote success in language, literacy and content with Transitioning and Expanding ELLs. Hampton-Brown's  Avenues Series involves a variety of language arts lesson plans for grades K-6, including writing, vocabulary building and  comprehension. English at Your Command provides comprehensive writing and grammar support for a range of writing forms  for students at all levels of proficiency.       Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding ELLs receive ELA Academic Intervention Services, AIS, in small groups to specifically  enhance listening, reading, speaking and writing skills via the content areas.  Guided reading specialists and resource room  teacher’s focus on basic grade level skills of Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students, using Soar to Success, which  is a research-based, intervention model.  Soar to Success contains instruction in four of the critical components of reading:  phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Comprehension instruction however, is the primary thrust of Soar to  Success and it is designed to develop in students an awareness of where and when to apply specific strategies to  independently unlock the meaning of the texts and books they read. AIS is also provided through Voyager Passport.  Voyager  Passport incorporates a multi-tiered approach to address academic difficulties for all students, reducing referrals to special  education.  Daily lessons provide explicit instruction: the teacher models the skill, and monitors group and individual practice  with corrective feedback. Research unequivocally recommends this instructional model for at-risk students. This program has  two components.  Word Work provides grade-appropriate instruction in phonemic awareness, letter-sound recognition, word  reading, and sight words. Each skill is taught explicitly, deliberately, and with a purpose in mind. Read to Understand gives  struggling readers daily opportunities to apply newly learned skills with accessible and engaging text. Vocabulary instruction is  focused upon while comprehension instruction helps students read more strategically.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         AIS is provided for math intervention using a program Mathletics.  Mathletics is used for  ELLs at all proficiency levels.  The AIS  provider matches the program level with the student’s proficiency.   Grades K-6, uses "Go Math", a program which provides  new teacher approach allowing teachers to address the rigors’ of new standards and assessments aligned with common  core.   These new materials are helping students achieve fluency, speed, and confidence with grade-level concepts.  All grades  are using a social studies program developed by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.  This program motivates students in grades K-6 to  become active and informed citizens while covering state standards and maximizing teaching time.  There is powerful reading  and vocabulary instruction which helps teach content area reading.  There are easy to use multiple resources to help meet the  needs of all learners in every classroom, including ELLs performing at Entering, Emerging,  Transitioning, Expanding, and  Commanding levels.  This program does have an Access for English Learners component.       Ms. Preston (AIS grade 1), Ms. Sanchez (AIS grade 2),  Mrs. Stratigakis (AIS Teacher for Grades 5), Ms. Castillo (SETSS provider),  Ms. Castro (Bilingual Guided Reading) and Mrs. Hechevarria (Guided Reading Teacher for Grade 6, including Bilingual students)  provide teachers in their given grades with additional support in the content area.  These teachers provide help to children at  the beginner and intermediate levels through use of graphic organizers, labeled photos to support vocabulary being taught in  the content area, as well as guided reading of the text to support concepts being taught by the classroom teacher.  Mrs.  Rampersaud (Prep Teacher for all grades) focuses on the teaching of Science throughout the grades.  She supplements the  programs used within the classroom with materials of her own.  She does many hands-on activities and projects with the  students and covers the grade appropriate concepts students need to learn.  She also has a Saturday, After School Program,  where she works with students preparing for the NYS Science test using the Delta FOSS Kits and doing hands-on experiments.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       For the years 2017-2018 teachers of ELLs will have to display and discuss with students language objectives for each math  lesson.  Teachers of transitional bilingual students will have math vocabulary cards in English and Spanish. Finally, at the end of  each Go Math lesson ELL strategies and ELL support will be available for struggling students. Fundations has been implemented  in all Bilingual classes and some ENL classes as per data.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   This school year, P.S. 86 does not plan to discontinue any program for ELLs.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  In order to continue to meet the instructional expectations called for in the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) our title III  monies for 2017-2019 will be used to implement a  supplemental afterschool program to improve students' skills in reading,  writing, and word study. Our goal is to provide support for our ELL students to achieve success in mastering the skills to pass  the standardized tests for their perspective grades. This will fuel a positive movement towards qualitative performance and  hold ELLs to the same high standards and expectations as non-ELL students. Beginning in October and ending in May, ELL  students are invited to attend an after-school program that will run two days a week for a total of 120 hours.  This program will  be aligned to the CCSS and the New York State ESL Standards.  The program will consist of an intensified reading and writing  academy in which ten to twelve students per class will be able to better develop reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.  Teachers will be committed to demonstrate effective teaching strategies with an emphasis on fluency to help students who  struggle in reading. Teachers will determine the amount of time devoted to fluency instruction depending on students’  NYSESSLAT proficiency level, Fountas and Pinnell reading comprehension level, and the students’ ability to identify words (high  frequency and content).  The program embeds the expectation that all children can learn as it will expose students to both  their home (HL) and English language (EL) in order to increase and enhance their academic vocabulary skills as well as their  oral, listening, reading, and writing skills in both languages.  In the technology lab, students will use iStation, MyON, and  Reading Plus to Read-online reading programs that allows students to read text at their independent reading level and answer  comprehension questions.  Students will also visit our library to borrow books, do research and read independently or read  with a partner on a regular basis.  Finally, each teacher will complete an assessment on each student to determine their reading and writing growth and to assess  the achievement of program related objectives. Our school collaborates with The Bronx Zoo, Lehman College Art program, The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      Beacon program (run by Mosholu Montefiore Community Center), Sports and Arts, Project Arts, The Guggenheim Museum,  Botanical Gardens,  Audubon Society, Solar One, Christadora and the Folk Art Museum.  These programs are available to all  students, including our ELLs.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Each of our classes is equipped with a SMART Board.  The SMART Board is an interactive, electronic whiteboard that enhances  instruction and learning.  The SMART Notebook software makes it possible for teachers to create content rich, dynamic lessons  addressing specific student skills.  These boards increase the interactive atmosphere in the classroom which in return increases  the learning experience and student engagement. The teacher can project their notes and presentations on these boards and  instead of becoming a one sided lecture, it becomes a two sided experience. Students can edit and make notes on the screen  or answer questions directly on it. This allows the students to play a larger part in the discussion and become more  intellectually engaged with the lesson. Teachers integrate various interactive websites into their lessons.  In addition, each  classroom is also equipped with an ELMO, groundbreaking document cameras and visual presenters benefit students,  especially ELLs by enabling teachers to incorporate stimulating high resolution visuals into their lesson plans and delivery. With  the ELMO teachers are able to improve interactions with their students, and allow students to gain knowledge through visual  interests.  Furthermore, our school has made available two computer labs, about four computers in each classroom, IPad carts  available to use for each grade on every floor, and two laptop carts.  The use of technology is implemented into lessons to  make learning interactive, meaningful, and authentic.  Some of the websites that our ELLs use are: www.starfall.com,  www.brainpop.com, www.4esl.org, www.nettrekker.com, www.mylibrarynyc.org in addition to other accessible sites. The  myON reader is another web based reading program student’s use.  The myON reader recommends content to readers at their  interest and reading level. Students become immersed in reading titles targeted specifically for them.  It provides reading  supports such as audio, highlighting and dictionary.  Teachers are able to develop personalized reading plans for students  based on their reading level and provide access to reading supports if necessary.  Students can monitor their progress through  their growth chart as well as number of books read and time spent reading.  It’s truly a magical experience.  Our school offers a  program called Playaways- an MP3 player created to encourage independent reading.  Students listen to an audio book  focusing on the correct English pronunciation and intonation.  The Playaways may be used in school or at home.  Our Media  Specialist/Librarian trains students how to use the Playaways and trains teachers to implement Playaways into their  curriculum.  Imagine Learning is a technology program also used by our ELL students.  It is an award-winning language and  literacy software program that features interactive activities, videos, and games. It’s research-based, differentiated, and  incredibly fun to use.  It has been an amazing tool for our newcomers especially.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the Bilingual Education program, each classroom is enriched with bilingual libraries.  Students are exposed to literature  surrounding various cultures and traditions.  Teachers use blue ink for all charts to differentiate the Spanish  language.  Teachers in TBE programs use the color blue (Spanish) to separate language use around the classroom.  This  separation of languages allow students to refer to the charts when working independently.  The flow of the day or daily  schedule clearly defines the subject, content and language objective, and language of instruction.   In the English as a Second  Language program, students have access to bilingual glossaries and buddy systems.  There are bilingual paraprofessionals  available to support students in the classrooms.  In addition both programs heavily rely on the use of Translanguaging  strategies to make content comprehensible for ELL students.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     All services and resources provided by our school correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  Our goal is to provide support for  our ELLs to achieve success in mastering the necessary skills needed to meet the demands of the CCLS and work towards  becoming college and career ready.  This will fuel a positive movement towards qualitative performance and hold ELLs to the  same high standards and expectations as all students.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school building is not shared.             16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Before the beginning of the school year newly enrolled ELL students are invited with their families to attend a parent  orientation during which they are informed about the variety of programs available for their children based on ELL  eligibility.  Various staff members present and offer valuable information to new families, including Mrs. Fitzpatrick (Assistant  Principal and Supervisor  for Grades K and 2), Kindergarten teachers, Alberto Velez (Parent Coordinator), Ray Wilson (PTA  President), Mrs. Monaco (Math Coach),  and Mr. Egan (Reading Coach).  In addition, the Parents Association holds meetings on  a monthly basis which these parents are welcomed to attend.  A calendar is distributed at the beginning of the school year  with tentative dates throughout the year. School tours are available upon request.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives are currently not offered to any student in P.S. 86 at the present time.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    P.S. 86 currently does not have a Dual Language Program.  We periodically review Parent Survey and  Program Selection Forms.  We file all of these forms in the ENL office, room 460.  If we collect more than  15 forms on two consecutive grades, requesting Dual Language, we will then prepare to provide this  program model.         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   Rigorous, research-based professional development is held for ELL educators and support staff, such as paraprofessionals,  psychologists, and occupational/physical therapists to provide the best teaching possible for our ELLs.  Our professional  development focuses on how to implement strategies that promote a literate learning environment which respects individual  diversities. Through assessment, observation, study groups and discussions with colleagues, we will continue to adjust  curriculum instruction to meet the needs of our students. Staff development will continue to support ENL methodologies and  strategies through technology in literacy development. All administrators will assist the staff with the implementation of  common core learning standards effectively align the curriculum of grades K-6. Mrs. Garcia and Mrs. Calderon attend the ELL  Compliance Conferences and various workshops provided by DELLSS.  They turn key valuable information to assist in planning  for our ELLs and provide classroom teachers with instructional support.  The school schedules a common prep for teachers of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      ELLs and Bilingual teachers bi-weekly.  During these meetings, teachers share best practices, plan collaboratively, look at  student work, and are introduced to new strategies.  Teachers are brought up to date about city and state mandates.     Professional Development Plan for ELL personnel is held on Professional Learning Mondays for 75 minutes.   Cycle 1 (Month of September): Implementation of the New CR Part 154:  New teachers learn about the regulations and policy  that govern education to ELLs and its implications in programming and the classroom.       Cycle 2 (Month of October): Understanding and Enhancing the mplemention of the Bilingual Common Core Progressions: EB  teachers use the new Progressions to align curriculum and Instruction.       Cycle 3 (Months of November and December) Engaging in Collaborative Inquiry:  Teachers of ELLs study the theories of  engaging in inquiry and put it into practice using ELL relevant data, identify a common problem, creating a plan of action,  implementing strategies to help resolve the problem, and assess student performance at the end of the cycle.       Cycle 4 (Month of January) Strategies for Academic Language Development: Teachers will explore and implement a variety of  strategies to improve students' academic language development.       Cycle 5 (Month of February and March):  Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques in the ENL/bilingual  Classroom:  Teachers of ELLs explore strategies to pose higher order thinking questions and discussion techniques to deepen student  understanding and use of academic language.  Teachers will explore the difference between divergent and convergent  questions and will implement a variety of strategies to help ELLs formulate hypotheses, make connections.       Cycle 6 (Months of April and May): Strengthening Instructional Practice:  Aligning practice and instruction to the Hallmarks of  Instruction.       Cycle 7 (Month of June) Reflecting on Practice and Looking ahead to the next school year     In addition professional development will be offered for teachers in science and social studies.  Teachers will collaborate in  grade level teams to navigate and implement the NYCDOE’s Enhanced Science  and Social Studies Scope and Sequence.  In  teams, teachers will determine the important content that students will learn and be clear about the big picture and key  concepts.  They will explore and deepen their understandings of the Enhanced Science Scope & Sequence and connections  between the NYS Science Standards and CCLS connections relative to the units of study.                      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Moving forward, to meet the requirements as per CR Part 154 the school has developed a plan to meet the mandate.  As part  of our professional development hours, our school has established a goal for each Monday. The school currently has 7 cycles of  professional learning teams (detailed on top). Of those 7 cycles, bilingual teachers will spend 4 cycles on bilingual specific  professional development. These teams will be teacher led as well as coach led. Teachers will look at data, student work, and  share best practices to meet the needs of ELL students. Teachers of self-contained ELL students will participate in 2 cycles of  ELL specific professional development. In addition to professional learning teams, bilingual teachers meet monthly for planning  time. During these meetings teachers plan units of studies and develop scaffold and additional support for those students in  need.  Finally, teachers of ELLs (bilingual and self-contained ENL classes) have a weekly meeting where lab sites, inter- visitations, and curriculum planning meetings  takes place.  All professional development opportunities are recommended and  opened to all teachers.  Professional development activities, plans, attendance sheets and agendas are kept in binders in the  coaches office and by individual facilitators.  We also have a google drive document that stores the topic, content, goals,  resources, and population that PDs are held for.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In order to comply with the new mandates of CR part 154, PS 86 will hold an annual meeting for parents of Ells. This meeting  will take place on a Tuesday afternoon after school. Phone blasts and letters will be sent home to inform parents of date and  time. We will use the same provisions for interpretations as we do during General PTC conferences-we use our own staff to  translate for our Spanish speaking parents and use the translation phone service provided by the office of translations for  parents who speak a language other than Spanish, as needed (other parents are seen by appointment to ensure that an  interpreter speaking their language is made available). Sign in sheets and agendas will be kept on file in alphabetical order.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  We believe in supporting our parents as partners in the educational program of their children. All school related information is  available in the language spoken by the families in our school community.  Assemblies, shows, writing celebrations, math bingo  night, literacy night, and STEM fair are held throughout the year for children and families. Each event is organized by the grade  level supervisor, coaches, and teachers.  Parents are invited to monthly PA meetings to discuss how the school may further  meet the needs of their children.  Our parent coordinator, Alberto Velez, is actively involved in providing parents of ELLs with  appropriate information and services. He helps ensure that parents of ELLs are contributing members of the education  community.  Parents of ELLs are invited to participate in the development of the school’s Comprehensive Education  Plan.  Student’s progress is reported to parents on a regular basis and parents are invited to the school for various classroom  activities.  Parents are invited to attend various workshops held by administration on how to assist their child with the many  programs available in our school.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Fiona Tyson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Kingsbridge Heights Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 10X086  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      During the registration process, the registration team (including secretaries, certified ENL teachers, and school  administrators) we collect new parents' preferred language of communication via the Home Language  Identification interview. During this interview, parents are asked which language they prefer when receiving  written notices from the school and which language they prefer when communicating with the school via phone  and in-person. Every beginning of the school year, we send home a survey providing parents the language  preferences we have on file and request that parents review the language preferences they have selected and ask  them to update those preferences as needed. We collect the survey and use it to update language preferences on  ATS and Student Emergency Contact Cards. In addition, we take the preferred language data to determine and  plan how we will communicate with our parents. For example, since our Spanish speaking parents are the vast  majority, they are easily covered by in-house staff. For parents who speak and prefer other languages, the staff  will use the Language Line number to access those other languages and communicate with these parents. We also  use translation services from DOE and non-DOE vendor like Guideline Language Center for one-on-one  conferences with parents who speak a language not covered by DOE's Language Line number. We will reach out   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      to these parents prior to special events and inform them that we have resources and supports in place to  communicate with them in their language. In addition, each beginning of the school year, we assess the events  and documents that require interpretation (in those specific languages) throughout the year and use our  resources and monies to plan accordingly.                 2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, PS 86 will communicate with families who speak languages other than English by  having in-house staff translators contact families. For families whose preferred oral language of communication is not  met by one of our staff members, we will use the over-the-phone option via Language Line to contact them. For other  languages not covered by the DOE, we will use outside vendors. In addition, each teacher will have a list of their  students names, parent preferred language and contact numbers in the BRT envelop each teacher has been trained to  use during school evacuation drills. This class roster will also include a header with the 1-800-Language Line (LL)  number and information on how to access LL.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The Language Access Coordinator will train all staff members in the fall (and do a refresher training mid-year) on how  to use the document translation services and over-the-phone interpretation service. During this training the staff will  receive flyers and resources (OPI quick access aid, language flyers, etc.) that will help in accessing the translation  services seemlessly. In addition, during this training, the staff will be made aware of the various resources available to  them and families like informational brochures, Language ID guide and card, etc). All these resources will be  reproduced, as needed, and made available to the staff as needed and on a quarterly basis.              Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          88           Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)   Welcome Poster will be posted in the main lobby of the school and in the main office in locations easily visible to  visiting parents.    Parents' Bill of Rights are made available to parents in a specific section of the school's main lobby. In addition, copies  of the bill are provided in the families' preferred language, as available, and offered to parents during the Fall and  Spring Parent-teacher conferences. Announcements are made throughout the duration of conferences, informing  parents of the availability of this resource in their language.   Parents' Guide to Language are made available to parents in a specific location in the school's main lobby. Additional  copies are sent home with students, and made available in the main office as well as during parent engagement  activities.    Language ID Guide is posted by the security desk in the main lobby and main office. Both security and main office  personnel use these guides to identify the language of preference of parents who speak languages other than English  or Spanish in order meet their needs.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?          During the May Parent-Teacher Engagement night, parents will be asked to participate in a survey providing their  responses to questions targeting the quality and availability of the translation and interpretation services they receive  throughout the year.
