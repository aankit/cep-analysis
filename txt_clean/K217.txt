This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The vision of our school is to provide the highest quality education for every general education student, English  Language Learner, special education, and high achieving student, in a stimulating and challenging learning  environment. It is our goal to develop all students into responsible capable citizens. We are devoted to helping  children from all cultural backgrounds become lifelong learners who will be productive and respectable citizens in a  changing global society. We are dedicated to including the collaborative efforts of every staff and community member  to guarantee excellence in achievement.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 217 is a barrier-free school with a current enrollment of over 1200 students, and is among the most diverse  elementary schools in the city. Over 30 languages and dialects are spoken at the school including Arabic, Urdu,  Spanish, Bengali, Russian, Chinese, Albanian, Haitian-Creole, Pashto, Nepalese, Tajik, Tibetan, Turkish, and Uzbek. On  every grade level there is a gifted class, inclusion classes, self-contained special education classes along with a full  spectrum of support services. P.S. 217 presents each student with an individualized educational experience utilizing  the countless resources New York City provides. We foster a warm and welcoming environment where each student is  supported and encouraged to reach their maximum potential. Residing in one of the country’s most diverse  neighborhoods, our school fully embraces the rich tapestry of cultures in our community.      We have a cohesive instructional focus which is embedded in all aspects of school practice through a common set of  beliefs about how students learn best. The steps we have taken to align the curricula to the common core learning  standards begin with school leaders and collaborative teams designing curriculum maps both horizontally and  vertically. The Professional Learning Committee and teacher teams collaborate to ensure all stakeholders have a clear  understanding of the importance of language development .    P.S. 217 sustains essential and meaningful partnerships that include; The Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, The  Brooklyn Museum, Chess in the Schools, Franklin Furnace Sequential Arts, The New York City Ballet and My Own  Book.     Through these successful partnerships along with an energetic and talented staff, P.S. 217 has cultivated a robust arts  program. The arts enrichment program exposes every child to music, drama, creative writing and studio art that is  woven into the standard curriculum. In addition, weekly art clubs and after school programs allow students to  immerse themselves in an area of particular interest such as puppetry, animation, music and movement, Arabic,  Mandarin, dance, sign language and various others. Once a year, major theatrical productions amaze parents and the  local community with student talent along with the quality of the production. The scripts are original age-appropriate  adaptations created by our teaching staff, costumes are hand-sewn, scenery is created by students , and musical  scores are written in-house and performed by an ensemble of 4th and 5th graders.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We provide an educational experience for students who are classified as having learning disabilities, emotionally  disturbed, as well as health impaired. Our Special Education population is 14% of the total student population. We  also service a significant amount of English Language Learners (27%). Last year we were able to have a Transitional  Bilingual Urdu kindergarten class. We will continue to offer that program for the 2018-2019 school year.       4.

Reflecting on the 2017-2018 school year, we are extremely proud of the work we embarked upon with the Teachers  College curriculum. Our teachers were provided with support from both Teachers College staff developers (K-2, 3-5)  as well as in house literacy coaches. Teachers were also provided with opportunities to attend Teachers College  calendar days throughout the year which gives teachers a deeper understanding of the units of study. During days  spent with Teachers College, teachers were provided with time to observe a staff developer model a specific skill or  strategy and time to debrief and ask clarifying questions.       In mathematics we will continue to apply the Go Math curriculum along with Exemplars-The Problem Solving  Procedure to supplement the work students need to make significant progress. Exemplars has provided students with  opportunities to display their thinking and solve word problems using a variety of strategies.       The 2017-2018 State ELA Exam resulted in 46% of our students falling in the proficient category. In Mathematics, 45%  of our students placed in the proficient range.

This data is using to adjust curriculum and  inform professional learning.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 217 Colonel David Marcus School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 217 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ●schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ●translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ●conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ●holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ●hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ●encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ●supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ●establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ●encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ●developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ●providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 217 utilizes the Teacher's College Reading Assessment system to assess and monitor the literacy progress of our English  Language Learners, as well as General and Special Education students.  The results are recorded in student assessment  portfolios, ENL student snapshots, and are systematically reviewed to give teachers detailed information about the strengths  and weaknesses of each student. The Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment has been selected as the progress monitor  for  our Commanding ELL students in first through fifth.  All of these results are reviewed and discussed with individual teachers at  grade meetings, to inform planning and instruction.  Academic language continues to be a focus for our school, as analysis of  ELLs,  and TC running record results show a pattern of deficiency in comprehension skills.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   These assessments are administered by the classroom teachers, as well as coaches and ENL staff.  Once the results are  recorded by the teachers onto their student snapshots, the information is shared with the ENL teacher during co-planning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         time. The ENL and classroom teachers meet at least once a week to do their planning. Our ENL teachers also have a common  prep with their co-teachers. During this time, teachers collaborate and decide which strategies will work best based on the  needs of the students. They also coordinate learning targets and lesson plans to ensure consistency. We have embraced the  co-teaching model to effectively reach all students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative / baseline assessments that we use include beginning of the year and end of year MOSL, Teacher's  College  reading assessment, Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments and writing, reading and math baselines.  In addition,  teachers administer chapter math tests, reading quizzes and writing pre-assessments  throughout the school year.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative assessment data has been gathered and analyzed, we determine which students are not making adequate  progress.  Those students are offered literacy intervention services provided by the classroom teacher.  Additionally, these  students will be invited to attend the Title lll ENL after school program as well as the ENL Saturday academy.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Tier 1: Data is collected by the classroom teacher in various ways, including F&P, TC,  MOSL Performance Assessments, Math  chapter tests and quizzes, teacher-created literacy assessments to identify a student's English Language Proficiency.   Through  collaboration with the classroom  teacher, during a common prep period, the classroom teacher and ENL teacher share the  data. The ENL teacher also provides  the classroom teacher  ENL strategies to use with the entire class, for example, scaffolding  instruction and providing appropriate and relevant content.   Tier 2: The ENL teacher provides small group instruction within the classroom, based on the needs of students.   Tier 3:  Moves the focus from small group to  individualized intensive intervention.  This is provided during an AIS period,  which each ENL teacher has scheduled in their program.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Upon complete review of student's NYSESLAT scores, we strategically place them in groups that will support, challenge and  invite them to share their thinking with students who are on the same academic level, as well as performing below and above.  The ELL Data Analysis Tool is used to identify and filter key information to better design instructional programs for our ELLs as  well as to make data-driven decisions to support the grouping and programming of our ELLs to accelerate academic  achievement.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to disseminate these findings, we have created snapshots for our ENL students that display the outcomes of the  NYSESLAT exam.  The results are broken down into four groups (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) to show each  individual student's area of need.  During our co-planning time, ENL teachers will share these findings with the general  education teachers.  Adjustments are made to the instruction and the grouping of students.   The data is also used to  determine which students are in need of additional interventions.  Those students will meet with their ENL teacher during  AIS time.           Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our freestanding ENL program is both heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels) and homogeneous (same proficiency  levels). ENL teachers push-in to the general education classroom, ICT or self-contained special education classroom  and co-teach with the classroom teacher(s). During the co-teaching periods both the ENL and classroom teachers  work as a team to present the mini-lesson. They are able to utilize their own pedagogical expertise thus providing all  students with a well-rounded lesson. All students benefit form this teaching model. ENL teachers also take small  groups of ELL students based on proficiency level and needs. During the stand alone periods the ENL teacher works  with beginning level ELLs to help reinforce strategies and skills previously taught. The ENL teacher also focuses on  language development and vocabulary through the use of ESL methodolgy. The classroom teacher and ENL teacher  share a common prep period to plan together and share data.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time, we do not have a TBE program, as per parent choice.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time, we do not have a DL program, as per parent choice.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and Emerging  level students receive 360 minutes (180 minutes standalone and 180 integrated ENL for entering and  90 minutes standalone and 180 minutes integrated and 90 flexibility.  Transitioning level students receive 90 integrated ENL  and 90 minutes flexibility.  The Expanding level students receive 180 minutes integrated ENL.  Commanding level students  receive 90 minutes integrated ENL.   The push-in program offers ENL in an integrated setting.    Special education students determined to be ELL based on their  NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores receive services in accordance with their Individualized Education Program (IEP).   At this time,  there is no Home Language Instruction because there is no bilingual program currently at P.S. 217.            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area instruction is delivered  from both the ENL teacher and the Classroom teacher, in English, using ENL  methodology.  A strong emphasis on academic language is a cornerstone of our ENL program. Our curriculum is aligned with  the CCLS, which is continually revisited and adjusted to meet the needs of all students. English Explorers and Early Explorers  from Benchmark  are used to teach content area Social Studies and Science to provide  background knowledge and academic  vocabulary. Bridges/Navigators from Benchmark also provide differentiated levels of instruction on a specific topic.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In addition to translated tests, bilingual school staff and agency translators are employed to administer state assessments to  English Language Learners.                      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  Plan for SIFE  Although we have no students with inconsistent educational backgrounds, few of our students fit the description of SIFE as  noted on the home language survey;  entering school after grade three with limited or no formal education.  Those students  who have had breaks in educational service are placed in AIS programs with an ENL teacher according to their educational  needs.  The ENL teacher will provide scaffolds(modeling, bridging, visualization) to ensure SIFE students meet the benchmarks  for their grade level.    b.  Plan for newcomers   Newcomers are placed in monolingual classrooms according to their level and ENL mandate.  A certified ENL teacher conducts  a push-in program to meet their mandated ENL instruction, following and supporting the P.S. 217 Curriculum Map.  As part of  our TitleIII funding, after school programs were offered for Kindergarten through second grade beginners to strengthen basic  reading and writing skills,  as well as listening and speaking.  c.  Plan for ELLs receiving service 4-6 years  ELLs receiving service 4-6 years are analyzed carefully through our ENL snapshot in order to identify areas of strengths and  weaknesses, and whether the student is in the "L2 Stall."  Targeted intervention is provided by the ENL teacher and through  AIS providers and technology based programs in the classroom.  As part of our Title III funding,  Saturday programs were  offered to grades three through five students for intervention. These students are identified for continued testing  modifications as required, such as extended time, special location, bilingual glossaries and translations for content area  exams.   d.  Plan for Long Term ELLs  Additional academic support is provided for long terms ELLs through push in/pull out services from ENL and AIS teachers as  needed.  Technology based programs offer further practice, for example Imagine Learning is offered during our ENL after  school program.  As part of our Title III funding, Saturday programs were offered to grades three through five for students who  needed intervention.  Long term ELLs students are identified for continued testing modifications as required, such as extended  time, special location, bilingual glossaries and translations for content area exams.    e.  Plan for Former ELLS  Commanding students are identified for continued testing modifications as required, such as extended time, special location,  bilingual glossaries and translations for content area exams.  They receive support for two years through our ENL push-in  program and receive Individualized Targeted Instruction by their classroom teacher.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use small group, targeted instruction to promote literacy skills and academic language development.  SWDs receive mandated ENL service and Special Education services according to their IEP.  All students requiring alternate  placement paraprofessionals have been assigned a bilingual paraprofessional to support them in the native  language.   Materials that support language acceleration and access to grade level content include,  Benchmark English  Explorers and AWARD Reading.  Benchmark English Explorers are theme based science and social social leveled books.  The  same topic is presented in four different ELL levels.  The English Explorers provide photos, audio CDs, glossaries, vocabulary  and comprehension support.  The English Explorers are used with students in grades 3 through 5.  Award Reading provides  leveled non fiction and fiction texts in print.  Some instructional strategies that ENL teachers use are TPR, graphic organizers,  sentence frames, and accountable talk stems.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   P.S. 217 uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDS in the least restrictive  environment, by carefully coordinating student programs for ENL and related services.  Students in integrated classes are  grouped according to their instructional needs, and work with both the Special Education and General Education teachers.  Special education students are often mainstreamed into general education classes for ENL or literacy instruction.  All students  have access to a rigorous curriculum, based on the school's unit plans.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All school based intervention programs have special accomodations for ELLs and are taught in English.  After school and /or  Saturday programs are offered in ELA and Math through Title III or Title I funding.  All programs include ELLs groups. Academic  interventions are offered on a "pull-out" basis by school staff to all "at- risk" students.  ENL teachers provide AIS one period per  week to at risk students, in addition to their mandated ENL service. These groups are flexible and rotate according to need.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      ELLs will participate in iReady math and Amplify Science initiatives at P.S 217.  We will continue  Teacher's College Reading and  Writing and Math Exemplars.  The program that we used for our after school program was Anchor Comprehension Workshop  from Benchmark Education.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We had a TBE Urdu program during the school year 2017-18.  We attempted to open one for the 2018-19 school year,  however after administering the NYSITELL,  many of our Urdu speaking students passed the exam.  We did not have the  amount of students necessary to maintain the class.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all school activities, academic and enrichment, including Discovery  Zone after school and Saturday programs.  They participate in Friday afternoon enrichment clubs and are included in the  performing arts program, which takes place after school during the spring semester.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ENL students at P.S. 217 have the benefit of a wide variety of materials specifically designed for ELLs, some of which include  AWARD Reading, Rigby IN STEP READERS, Benchmark BRIDGES and ENGLISH EXPLORERS,  Anchor Comprehension Posters and  NYSESLAT preparation materials.   ENL materials are centrally located and in a designated ENL resource room for easy  access.  The rich selection of Balanced Literacy materials housed in our Literacy Room and ENL room  are also available to  teachers for use with LEP students as appropriate.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided to students in several ways.  Students with disabilities who require alternate placement  paras as indicated by their IEPS have paraprofessionals to interpret and explain material in the home language.  An Urdu  speaking Family Worker supports selected beginners with additional push-in tutoring.  Other bilingual school staff assist  students in their home language whenever feasible. Translators from our school staff are employed for parent events and  outreach.  Math and Science state exams are administered with translations for every language.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All service and support resources correspond to the appropriate age and grade levels of our English Language Learners.  Both  the ENL push-in Kindergarten teacher and the classroom teacher support the kindergarten curriculum through pacing  calendars and unit plans which are located on a Google Drive.  This affords the ENL teacher a better opportunity to work  collaboratively with the classroom teacher. Our curriculum, on every grade, includes modifications for ELL students.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    P.S. 217 does not share a building (co-location).     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         During the summer of 2018 selected students were chosen to participate in a division of summer school that  addressed ENL    students who needed additional support in grades 2-5.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time, we do not have language electives.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   At this time, we do not currently have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All staff, at P.S. 217, have the benefit of school based math and literacy coaches, as well as, a combination Data Specialist/  Math staff developer. Classroom-based professional development is centered on improving teacher practice in literacy and  math instruction, and deepening the implementation of the academic language component of ENL instruction. All teachers  participate in workshops presented by school specialists in literacy, math, technology, and ENL.  In addition, ENL teachers  participate in grade level curriculum conferences as well as ENL specific meetings and workshops.  Topics include Common  Core Learning Standards, looking at student work, math problem solving strategies, and questioning techniques.  Teacher  teams meet weekly to examine student work and engage in the inquiry process during the Monday Professional  Development.   Some of the topics included, co-teaching, academic language, and technology based programs.   Our ENL teachers are invited to attend ELL specific workshops at Teachers College and the district office.  Then the teachers  turnkey what they learned on Professional Development Mondays.  ENL teachers are also included in all content area  professional development that pertain to the CCLS and Teachers College.  ENL teachers are also included in unit planning for all  content areas.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  On Monday and Tuesday during after school,  as part of the Professional Development hours, PS 217 will provide a minimum of  15% of the required PD hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 .  The Professional Development is dedicated to  language acquisition and includes a focus on best practices on co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content  instruction for ELLs.  For ENL teachers a minimum of 50% of the required PD hours is dedicated to language acquisition in the  content arAgendas and attendance will be collected and stored in the staff developers' office.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The parent coordinator invites and assists families with the application process for middle school during a Middle School  meeting. She also disseminates information about middle school opportunities and open houses.   In addition, parent meetings are scheduled on Tuesday after school. At this time the classroom and ENL teacher meet with  parents to discuss their child's progress.  Translators are available when needed.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      P.S. 217 schedules many opportunities for parents to become involved and informed about their children’s education. For  example, Meet the Teacher Night are scheduled in September. Parents are invited to participate in our read aloud day and  classroom writing celebrations. Bilingual parent volunteers, as well a bilingual staff are available to assist parents and facilitate  communication with teachers and administrators.  Bilingual Paraprofessional, Family Workers and School Aides assist with  outreach on a regular basis. We also have ongoing participatory programs such library hours for parents on Tuesday  afternoons. Oral translations in Urdu, Bengali, Russian, Arabic and Spanish are provided through school staff and parent  volunteers.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Robert Bonilla, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Colonel David Marcus School                                                                              School DBN: 22K217  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
