This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview      “SOARing To Greater Heights”   Mission   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         The Mission of P396K is to ensure that all students are Safe, while providing transitional Opportunities, promoting   Accelerated Learning, and Reaching the community to promote student independence.      Vision   The Vision of P396K is to cultivate a school environment which embodies Professionalism, a Positive attitude,  Productivity and Proactiveness in order to foster student engagement, coherent instruction, and accelerate   learning.    2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P396K is part of District 75 and provides IEP-driven special education services to a multicultural, multi-linguistic,  school community. We are committed to inspiring, guiding, and supporting our students and their families, through  standards-based instructional programs, supported by a full array of related and support services. Staff members  work collaboratively in a professional, positive, proactive and productive environment to ensure that our students  gain independence throughout the 12 month school year and beyond.   We currently have 3 sites( P.S 396, P.S 181, P.S 289) that are housed in district 23 and 17. In the school year of 2018- 2019 we will be opening 2 additional sites( P.S 323, P.S 532 ).Our students range between the ages of 4. 9 to 13.9  years old. As a school community we set high expectations for learning in order to ensure that all students are  receiving rigorous instruction. As a result, we have implemented a SOARing Curriculum Team   (SCT) that is geared towards purposeful planning, inquiry and curricula adjustments. The SOARing Curriculum Team  has created a thematic skills based curriculum to promote student achievement by incorporating standards and  learning targets that support rigorous instruction. They have also aligned each unit of learning to Danielson  component 3C- Engaging students in learning through the design of authentic activities, differentiated assignments,  groupings, instructional materials and structure through the use of the workshop model. There are additional  resources that support our school curriculum such as, Attainment (ELA & Math), Go Math, SMiLE (Literacy),  Fundations (Reading), Hand Writing Without Tears (Writing), First Author (Writing), GRTL (Wellness), Cookshop, PBIS  (Self-Regulation), Rethink (Data), Arts (Music, Dance, Theater, Visual Arts), a Vocational Skills Framework and ABA-VB.       All students work towards IEP goal mastery within the context of the Next Generation Learning Standards(NGLS) and  the Essential Elements. The SOARing Curriculum Team develops monthly instructional guides in the areas of English  language arts, Math, Science ,Social studies and Pre-vocational skills. These guides link content to the DLM Essential  Elements, ADVANCE and our student driven Mini Museums that will show case student learning and exemplary  student work. The Mini Museums will also enable students to experience curricular content from a sensory approach  that include opportunities for tactile, kinesthetic, auditory and visual experiences. Students are assessed using SANDI,  FAST, and NYSAA. The Data Specialist and our Professional Learning Communities will review Rethink data linked to  student IEP goals along with student engagement/independence portfolios. Based on the findings, adjustments will  apply to the curriculum, unit plans and lesson plans. On-going progress monitoring will also be used to inform student  progress.      According to Framework for Great Schools, Collaborative Teachers and a Supportive Environment is essential to  student achievement. We provide regular opportunities for staff to collaborate and engage in shared inquiry work on  Tuesdays and Thursdays. During this time lead facilitators and instructional lead teachers drive professional  development, analyzing student work and reflection on data. Staff also provides professional development to their  colleagues by offering "lunch and learn" sessions on topics of interest. Parent engagement is also key to student   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      success, therefore, we also strive to build positive and supportive relationships with parents through parent  workshops, Family Fun Day, and Title 3 programs throughout the school year.      As a school community, our instructional focus is SOARing to Independence by engaging students in learning through  coherent instruction. We ensure that teachers plan engaging activities and assessments with coherence so that  students are able to build on knowledge and make connections between lessons. Coherence is also key to our school  because it requires teachers to have a clear understanding of content, curriculum and school expectations for student  learning. It is through our instructional focus that we will be able to determine growth towards independence for  each individualized learner. Therefore, our focus will become a common language that lives through all school  programs, initiatives, classrooms, events and meetings. We are designing a blue print that will unite the voices of all  stakeholders in defining what Soaring to Independence looks like, sounds like and feels like across all classrooms and  across all families. We are dedicated towards student achievement and will exceed the expectation of our  instructional focus through rigorous instruction, new teacher meetings, Professional Learning Communities, thematic  skills based curriculum, pre-vocational skills, extended cabinet, School Leadership Team(SLT)and our various  supportive school teams.                  3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 396K is a K-8 School with 311 students from Kindergarten - Grade 8. The school population is comprised of 100%  students with special needs including autism, multiple disabilities, cerebral palsy, intellectually disabled and down  syndrome. The student body also includes 17% English Language Learners. Students specific needs include assistance  with communication, behavior support and academic support. All students have an individualized education plan  which serves as a living document to monitor the needs of all students. We utilize alternate assessment tools such as  ABLLS, SANDI, NYSAA, and FAST that support progress monitoring for our students and their specific needs. Educators  incorporate a full range of strategies, techniques and specialized programs such as structured teaching, Applied  Behavior Analysis (ABA), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), Get Ready To Learn(GRTL), and Positive  Behavior Intervention System(PBIS). Technology is also used to support our students through classroom technology  and augmentative communication devices. We have specialized curricular programs that support classroom  instruction such as Attainment and additional resources such as UNIQUE, SMiLE, and Fundations. Rethink is a data  tool that will help to track student IEP goals along with the Next Generation Learning Standards. Rethink will also  assist teachers and instructional leaders make decisions about curricular and student specific needs.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our 2016-17 School Survey indicated a high level effective school leadership and trust. According to the survey  parents feel that the educators at our school display an understanding for families problems and concerns (95%).  Teachers expressed that school leadership was able to communicate a clear vision for the school (83%) and that there  was an evident coordination of curriculum, instruction, and learning materials across grade levels (90%). Teachers and  parents also expressed satisfaction in the area of Rigorous Instruction. According to the survey parents expressed that  the school works to achieve the goals on their children's individualized education plans.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths:   According to our 2015-2016 Quality Review Report Indicator 1.1 which focuses on ensuring engaging, rigorous and  coherent curricula in all subjects our school was rated a well developed. The findings indicated that curricula decisions  that were made by school leaders and staff have resulted in alignment to the Common Core Learning Standards and  integration of all instructional shifts for all learners. Through refining of curriculum maps and units of study teachers  are able to provide accessibility to instruction through multiple entry points. Educator provide rigorous instruction by  making purposeful decisions about curricula that are based on student performance and periodic assessments.  Results from the 2016-2017- NYSAA indicated that there was an increases in assessed DLM Essential Elements with  students performing at a level 3 and 4 in Math and ELA.      Needs:   Our needs include aligning assessment to curricula in order to make purposeful instructional decisions and designing  engaging activities based on desired results. Designing coherence in assessment will allow teachers to use common  assessments and make instructional decisions that will impact the rigor of instruction. The Essential Elements and the  Next Generation Learning Standards will be aligned to curricula and Professional Learning Communities will monitor  and refine instructional goals. Instructional leaders will support rigorous instruction by supporting and outlining  professional development for teachers monthly. Teachers will analyze student work, the Attainment Data Keeper and  Rethink to make instructional decisions that are embedded in rigor.

Strengths:   The most recent Quality Review (2015-16) found the school to be Well Developed in area 3.4 which addresses school  culture. In addition the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot highlights that the parents and teachers feel that the school  is providing a supportive environment for our students. According to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot 95% of the  teachers expressed that the school environment is a safe one for the students. Our results on the 2016-17 School  Quality Guide also supports that the school environment is supportive. The school received a score of 4.32 on the  Framework element and a score of 4.12 on the survey element for Supportive Environment. The school has also been  collaborating more with community schools in order to provide our students with meaningful experiences with the  general education population. We have various events and activities with our collocated community schools, P.S. 289,  P.S. 181 and P.S. 327. This was highlighted by our collaboration with P.S. 181 being selected as a Collaborative School  Community and being a part of the "Just Say Hi" initiative. We have also had an increase in the number of students  moving to LRE.      Needs:   According to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot only 77% of the teachers say that teachers feel responsible that all  students learn, and only 89% of parents believe that the school offers activities and services to improve life outcomes  for their children. These areas can be increased. During the 2018-19 school year focus will be on increasing teachers  ability to create activities and learning opportunities that lead to high student engagement and increased student  independence.       Policies. Practices and Structures:   During the 2018-2019 school year our parent professional development opportunities will continue on a monthly  bases and focusing on various topics. Collaborative opportunities for our students with the general education  population will continue in order to provide support in identifying students who can move to LRE. During the 2017- 2018 school year structures were put into place in order to identify students who were becoming more independent  in order to decrease services (Related services, 1:1 paraprofessionals), and identify those who can benefit from LRE,  these structures will be finalized and there will be continued use in the 2018-19 school year. There will be continued  professional learning communities and collaborative planning periods for teachers to work on creating high  expectations for independence and activities for student engagement. Teachers will also be provided with additional  time to conduct parent outreach and provide support for parents.

Strengths:   During the 2017-2018 school year, teachers participated weekly in teacher teams using the tuning protocol. The  tuning protocol was used as a guide to meet students cognitive level and make adjustments to teaching and learning.  Teachers reflected on student work, IEP goals and assessment results from SANDI/FAST. Teacher teams have also  worked together to refer students to a Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) and those students are succeeding in their  placements. Teachers participate in inter- visitations based on teachers stated area of need to strengthen their  pedagogical needs. Teachers responded positively to this form of professional development because they received  the opportunity to observe specific teaching strategies and classroom structure. On the 2015 - 16 Quality Review, 4.2  was rated Well Developed and scored 4.99. Based on the 2017 School Survey section for Collaborative Teachers ,  Teachers responded 4/4 to the question " How well do the teachers work with each other?" and 83% of teachers say  that teachers at 396K work together to design instructional programs compared to the city wide average of 84%,  which is +.1 compared to the citywide average. Paraprofessionals also engage in collaboration through the Rethink  Program. Paraprofessionals were engaged in professional development throughout 2016 – 17, using Rethink to hone  in on skills that will support instruction such as reinforcement and prompting.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   0    0    0    0    0      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 396, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.         Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 396 will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;     Providing additional time for classroom teachers to complete parent outreach assignments.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43               Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to  more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s programs. This information will be maintained  by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Our  students’ ages range from 4 years, 9 months to 14 years.  Our class ratios (12:1:4, 12:1:1, 6:1:1,  8:1:1, and 8:1) are held at the Main Site as well as our two off sites located at P.S. 181 and P.S.  289.  We will open two additional sites in September of 2018 at P.S. 323 and P.S. 532  respectively.  Our school's focus is that ALL of our students are "SOARing" to greater  independence through rigorous, authentic student engagement in learning.  Eighty-five of our  ELLs participate in Alternate Assessment and four ELLs participate in Standardized  Assessment.  During the 2018-2019 school year, all eligible ELLs will participate in the New  York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) in the spring of  2019.  In addition, all of our New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) age eligible ELLs  will participate in the 2019 NYSAA exam.   Our 2017-2018 Title III program proved to be highly successful, so for this year we decided to  invite 12 ELLs in grades K-2 who scored at the "Entering level" of language proficiency on the  2018 NYSESLAT to participate in our 2018-2019 program.  The theme of our Title III  Supplemental Instructional Program will be "Understanding and Mobilizing Community  Helpers."  Our goal for the Title III Supplemental Instructional Program is to have our ELLs  utilize current best ENL practices by using strategies that will help them improve upon their  knowledge in the ELA and Math content areas as well as activities of daily living (ADL) through  the use of our school designed instructional program, which focuses on student work tasks,  thematic units, authentic work products.  There will be an additional focus on career awareness  and readiness skills as well as 21st century work related skills for ELLs in grades K-2 as  informed by the New York State Next Generation Learning Standards (NGLS) and New York  State Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS).  Our teachers will address the  NYS NGLS, the NYS New Language Arts Progressions, and the NYS CDOS standards in their  lesson/unit plans about community helpers.  In addition, with regard to the development of self- care skills, our students will display what they have learned through a project learning walk at  the culmination of the Title III program.   In exploring the community helpers project, our students will focus on different community  helpers; learn about their roles and responsibilities, and how they can be mobilized in the real  world.  They will also have an opportunity to interact with the school nurses to learn more about  personal hygiene and improve upon foundational ADL skills.  According to Rusch & Phelps  (2014), "These students do possess the potential to live and work in the community if they  receive appropriate life skills instruction."  Life skills are essential to daily life; we want to  provide our students proper instructions on self-care skills, and personal/social skills in order for  them to be able to live in this society.  The role play approach allows students to explore realistic  situations by interacting with other people in a managed way in order to develop experience and  try different strategies in a supported environment (Ian Glover, 2014).  The Title III program will  supplement the regular mandated ELL instruction that the students receive during the school  day.  A total of (12) grade K-2 ELL students will participate in the Title III Supplemental   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Program.  We plan to have two instructional groups of students in grades K-2, utilizing a 6:1:1  ratio.  Classes will meet on selected Fridays for a total of 16 2-hour sessions (32 instructional  hours) to be completed during the 2018-2019 school year.  We plan to commence the Title III  program on Friday, 1/4/19 and end on 6/7/19.  Our instructional hours will be from 3:00 pm -  5:00 pm. In order to present the culminating project to parents and students during the Title III  program, we plan to host our culminating ELL showcase on the last Friday of the program on  6/7/19.  An administrator will be available to supervise the Title III program during each instructional  day of the program. The two instructors in our Title III program will include: two certified  teachers; (1) Bilingual (Spanish) and (1) ENL teacher.  Student-to-staff ratios will be maintained  as two pedagogues will be providing direct instruction to two groups of students using a 6:1:1  ratio at all times during the program.  We plan to hire four paraprofessionals to work in the Title  III program.  Due to the young chronological age of our students, we plan to hire an additional  paraprofessional for each classroom in order to support transition, behavioral, and socio- emotional issues that may arise.  We will make every effort to post for and hire paraprofessionals  who speak the home languages of the students represented in the Title III program.  In order to  further develop the students' daily living skills, the instructors will focus on self-care  activities.  They will work closely with students on the following: language acquisition skills,  fine motor skills, tactile sensory input, visual-motor skills, and visual perception skills.  All  functioning human beings need to have a bilateral approach or bilateral coordination in order to  perform their activities of daily living to the highest degree possible.  Bilateral coordination is  defined as the ability to “cross the midline.”  Having a well-developed sense of bilateral  coordination enables both feet and/or both hands to work together; this area will be strengthened  by hands on projects about community helpers.  Based on our internal school data (IEP system,  the School Functioning Assessment (SFA) and other informal assessments) collected by our day  teachers and related service providers, this skill is primary for all of our alternate assessment  students because it must be taught discretely and then embedded into our curriculum across  content areas. The language of instruction for the after school program will be English; the home  language will be used when required as a best practice support for students.  The Title III program will include the use of iPads and electronic SmartBoard for instruction, as  well as teacher made materials. The students' instructional day will consist of two periods of  teaching.  Instruction will be provided in English by a certified Bilingual teacher (Spanish), a  certified ENL teacher, and supported by four paraprofessionals.  Instruction will be differentiated  according to the functioning levels of the students as well as our students' 2018 NYSESLAT  scores.  The enrichment component will focus on community helpers and self-care skills.  Our  ELLs will learn about the roles of community helpers, as well as the vocabulary and technical  terms needed to be successful in this domain specific activity.  In addition to teacher made  materials, we will purchase assorted community helper materials for the culminating event at the  end of the program; we will also utilize communication devices as well as other supplies and  materials purchased last year.  Teacher designed pre-and post-test activities, teacher made  checklists, and hands on role play activities will be used to assess the students' growth at the  beginning and completion of the 16 sessions.

The  Assistant Principal and our Parent Coordinator will present the Title III materials to the  parents/guardians in their preferred languages. In addition, parents will receive the Title III letter,  in their home language, a couple of months in advance of the program.  Our ELL teachers and  educational assistants will make telephone calls (in the home language of the parents) concerning  the program once the Title III letters have been disseminated.  Parents will be encouraged to  assess their own personal home needs for communication and social interaction with their  children.  It is an expectation of the program that our parents will be in the classroom and work  alongside their children and learn about the instructional strategies used to support them during  the day.  The parent coordinator is responsible for overseeing the parental engagement component of our  program, and she will survey the parents to find out their concerns and topics of interest.  In  order to encourage family literacy practices, we will host a raffle for parents for 1 ($30.00) gift  card to Barnes and Noble at the completion of our program.  Light refreshments will be served to  the parents during the Title III program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our school uses the Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI), a CCLS aligned assessment to identify students'  IEP goals in grades K-8 and FAST is used to benchmark students' IEP development two times a year in the fall and spring. The  instructional program that all ELLs are exposed to is UNIQUE, which is used in conjunction with monthly curricular testing units  that are a key component of this instructional program.  Other  literacy assessments that are used as either an intervention  and/or a supplement to UNIQUE include, but are not limited to: the Work Sampling System (K-2), SMILE, Attainment, First  Author, and teacher-created assessments.  The ENL teacher works collaboratively with each Special Ed. classroom teacher in  the building to create SMART IEP goals for ELA/ENL for our ELL students.                          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All teachers, inclusive of licensed ENL and bilingual teachers participate in weekly teacher cohorts or professional  learning communities across sites.  During cohort meetings teachers discuss student work, monthly thematic projects,  identify student needs, and develop actionable next steps to support our students' learning goals as a  group.  Teachers follow a facing calendar for assessments (NYSAA, SANDI, and FAST).  Furthermore, we utilize an  instructional guide that is based upon UNIQUE and created by a team of P396K teachers across sites.  The guide is  separated by grade bands (K-2, 3-5, and 6-8) and offers an enrichment component.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Primarily, we evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by students' progress on the NYSESLAT exam. However,  since the currentNYSESLAT exam was designed for a General Ed./Standardized assessment population and our ELLs  are all in a full-time Special Ed./alternately assessed population, the current NYSESLAT exam is an insufficient stand- alone measure to determine ELL progress.  In addition to the NYSESLAT, we utilize our students NYSAA, SANDI, FAST  scores as a comparative data source to identify areas of need for our ELLs.  alternate assessment students.  The  majority of our school population (K-8) functions on a kindergarten reading and writing level as measured by the  spring 2017 SANDI data results. SANDI is a Comprehensive Classroom System for Students Taking Alternate  Performance Assessments.  Due to the severe cognitive disabilites that our students have, the ELL Periodic  Assessment tool is currently not a valid assessment tool for use with our ELLs because it cannot assess all of our  students in the four modalities : reading, speaking, listening, and writing.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         ENL, monolingual, and bilingual teachers work in cohort teams to review the data from SANDI in the fall.  During the  early spring we utilize a school-wide pacing calendar to develop smart goals around targeted groups of students as  per their SANDI scores that will support growth in the areas of reading, writing, communication, and math.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   With regard to RtI framework for ELLs, the SANDI provides a basis to determine educational benefits related to the student’s  present levels of performance, progress on IEP goals, and identification of educational needs.  We are familiar with the RtI  model for ELLS.  We adhere to the principle that the RtI model holds significant promise for better serving English Language  Learners (ELLs) who are at-risk for academic difficulties and consider it in the team development of our students’ IEP goals and  progress monitoring.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Due to profound developmental and/or cognitive delays, the data reveals that across grade levels our students score in the  low range on both the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  With regard to the five levels of language progressions, out of 80 ELLs, one  student is on the transitioning level, the remaining students would fall between the entering and emerging language levels.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Components of the information contained herein is disseminated to parents, teachers, and staff at SLT meetings, faculty  conferences, memos from the administration, our monthly ENL newsletter, parent-teacher conferences, IEP meetings, and  through the school's website.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At P396K we utilize a blended Integrated/standalone model for ENL instruction as per CR Part 154 across all of our three sites  (Main, P396K@181, and P396K@289).  The fully certified ENL teacher provides her services in a separate location within a  classroom (standalone) or provides (integrated) services in classrooms that have the highest number of ELLs.  Students are  grouped heterogeneously within three contiguous grade groupings by early childhood (K-2), upper elementary (3-5) and  middle school (6-8).  ENL is implemented through Integrated/standalone instructional practices.  The majority of our students  fall between the entering and emerging language levels and are entitled to 360 minutes of ENL instruction.  All of the students  in the freestanding ENL program participate in Alternate Assessment.  The ENL teacher attends instructional cohort meetings  (Professional Learning Communities) with her Special Ed. counterparts across all three sites.  In the Cohort meetings we have  discussed Advance, the Danielson Framework-NYC Focus, multiple entry points, differentiated Instruction, lesson planning,  data driven decision making, ELL compliance issues, co-teaching, and the integration of the CCLS in our classrooms.              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our Transitional Bilingual Program, which is located at our 289 site, is made up of an eight period day, where each period is  defined as a 48 minute block of time, for a total of 384 minutes per day.  The languages if instruction are Yiddish and  English.  This program is composed of 2 bilingual classes, 1 in grades K-2 and another in grades 3-5 respectively.  All of the  students in the TBE program participate in Alternate Assessment.  Based on the students' proficiency in both language and  academics which identifies them as entering, a 75:25 ratio is used in our Yiddish 6:1:1 (grades K-2) class.  The Yiddish 6:1:1  (grades 3-5) class uses a 60:40 ratio.  Students receive instruction in all subject areas, including a minimum of five discrete   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      periods of Home Language Arts (HLA).  All TBE students receive the mandated number of minutes as per C.R. Part 154, which is  360 minutes of ENL, for students at the entering/emerging ENL levels.  All of our TBE teachers are NYS certified.  All of our TBE  students participate fully in the UNIQUE instructional program and are exposed to the CCLS as well as the Instructional Shifts;  our teachers adapt instruction to the students’ individual needs.  The TBE teachers' schedule consists of the following:  Breakfast, Sensory Block, ENL, ELA, Lunch, Math, HLA, Science, Social Studies, PBIS, Gym, and Library.  The bilingual teachers  attend instructional cohort meetings (Professional Learning Communities) with their monolingual counterparts.  In the Cohort  meetings we have discussed Advance, the Danielson Framework-NYC Focus, multiple entry points, differentiated Instruction,  lesson planning, data driven decision making, ELL compliance issues, co-teaching, and the integration of the CCLS in our  classrooms.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Paste response to questions here:   N/A     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  English as a New Language: All students in bilingual classes receive 360 minutes of mandated ENL instruction as required by CR  Part 154 for ENL students at the entering and emerging language proficiency levels.  To ensure that students meet the  standards and pass the required state and local assessments, ENL instruction follows the NYS New Language Arts Progressions  and Home Language Arts Progressions and incorporates ENL strategies such as: Total Physical Response (TPR), Language  Experience, Scaffolding Techniques, and graphic organizers.  All classroom teachers submit their teaching schedules to a  supervising administrator for review.  The use of technology and augmentative communication devices such as Big MAC's  paired with Mayor Johnson symbols or SymbolStixs, iPad applications for ELA and Math, adapted switches and the use of the  UNIQUE instructional program during pullout sessions are incorporated to give ALL students additional instructional  support.  Multi-sensory and multicultural ENL materials are infused throughout all aspects of instruction.  The students who  have obtained proficiency on the NYSESLAT will be provided with AIS (Math & ELA) instructional support for up to two years.    English Language Arts: Students at the commanding language level will receive .5 units of study per week of integrated ENL in  ELA/Content Area, or other approved Former ELL services for two additional years.  At the current time, we do not have any  commanding level students.  ELA instruction for ELLs follows the NYS CCLS, the Balanced Literacy Program, and monthly  thematic units that are aligned to UNIQUE.  The Instructional Shifts are embedded into the school day through the utilization  of the UNIQUE instructional guides (ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies) across all sites.  The use of software and  multimedia enhances and supports the development of English literacy.  Activities are extended throughout the UNIQUE  instructional program and content areas by combining the interdisciplinary/thematic approach with Language Experience,  multi-sensory approaches, the infusion of the arts, the use of technology, and augmentative communication (hi-tech and low- tech).  The classroom library contains books in English, including those adapted by teachers to meet the needs of students with  severe disabilities.  We also use VizZle, an on-line software program designed to meet the needs of visual learners and  students with autism to supplement our ELA program.    Home Language Arts: All students in Yiddish speaking TBE classes receive a minimum of 180 minutes per week of Home  Language Arts (HLA) as well as 2 units in of content instruction in the home language.  HLA instruction follows the NYS Home  Language Arts Progressions, incorporating Balanced Literacy and CCLS aligned curricula, emphasizing the development of  phonemic awareness and comprehension skills through literature-based and standards based materials and activities.  HLA  instruction is parallel to the literacy instruction imparted in monolingual classes and is provided by a certified bilingual teacher  utilizing native language literacy materials such as “My First Yiddish Word Book,” a new illustrated Yiddish dictionary for  children by Joni Kibort Sussman.  The use of bilingual software and multimedia enhances and supports the development of  native language skills.  HLA literacy activities are extended throughout the curriculum and subject areas, by combining the  interdisciplinary/thematic approach with Language Experience, multi-sensory approaches, an infusion of the arts, the use of  technology tools, and augmentative communication.  To comply with the New York City literacy requirements, each classroom   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      library contains books in students' native languages, including those adapted by our bilingual teachers to meet the needs of  students with severe disabilities.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Language instruction, linked to subject area teaching/learning, is crucial to the success of ELLs in achieving Cognitive Academic  Language Proficiency (CALP), in two languages.  The languages used in the TBE program are English and Yiddish.  For K-8  students at the entering and emerging levels of English language acquisition in the TBE program, content area instruction is  provided as follows: a minimum of two content areas taught in the home language, and a minimum of one subject area taught  in English through ENL methodologies.  ENL strategies include: CALLA, the Language Experience Approach, the Natural  Approach, Scaffolding Techniques, TPR, and the use of graphic organizers.  Content Area Instruction follows the NYS CCLS and  the curriculum embedded instructional shifts. The use of technology and augmentative communication are incorporated into  ENL and content area instruction to give students additional support.  Multi-sensory and multicultural materials are infused  throughout all aspects of the instructional day.    The language used in the Freestanding ENL program is English.  In this program, content area instruction is provided as follows:  all subject areas are taught in English through ENL methodologies by Special Education teachers who have completed the  mandated 10 hours of 'Jose P. ESL training.'  In addition, our licensed ENL teacher uses the integrated model as a key  component of her program to further support the practice of using ENL to teach through the content areas.  The ENL  methodologies used include: TPR, CALLA, Language Experience, the Natural Approach, the use of graphic organizers, a variety  of multi-sensory approaches used in conjunction with augmentative communication devices, and scaffolding  techniques.  Visual aides and symbols inclusive of Google images, Super Symbols, Mayer Johnson symbols, SymbolStixs, and  VizZle are used to enhance Content Area Instruction.  Content Area Instruction follows the CCLS, NYS New Language Arts  Progressions, and CDOS standards where appropriate.  The use of technology is incorporated into ENL and content area  instruction to give our students additional supports and access.  Multi-sensory and multicultural materials are infused  throughout all aspects of our instructional program.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   All Spanish speaking ELLs are given the Spanish LAB following the NYSITELL.  We began using the NYSITELL to replace the LAB-R  in February 2014, however, Spanish speaking ELLs who are identified as per HLIS will continue to receive the Spanish  LAB.  During the CSE process, all ELLs are evaluated in their home languages. The students in the TBE program receive a  minimum of 180 minutes of discrete HLA instruction in Yiddish and they are evaluated therein as a component of their  program.  We also have bilingual speech therapists (Spanish and Yiddish) who use the identified home language to support  speech services as per IEP.  When the school does not have the minimum number of required students to open a TBE program  in students' native language, ELLs who are mandated for a TBE program as per IEP are provided with an alternate placement  paraprofessional who speaks the home language for additional support .     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  By virtue of having an IEP and the additional support of Universal Design for Learning strategies, instruction is seamlessly  differentiated for all of our ELLs.  The instructional focus of our school this year is to continue to embed/incorporate multiple  entry points into ALL aspects of the students' instructional day.  SIFE, Newcomers, Developing, Long Term and Former ELLs  benefit from receiving differentiated content area instruction through UNIQUE.  Currently, we have 2 SIFE students.  Our  newcomers receive support from a paraprofessional, tutoring, a buddy student, development of initial literacy in their home  language, and a nurturing environment to facilitate language production.  SIFE students are paired with an English proficient  buddy to help them adjust to life in an academic setting.  Developing ELLs have an opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of  our school program. Transition Plan: students who no longer require Bilingual or ENL services because they have tested out on  the NYSESLAT, will be supported for up to two years with ENL (if scheduling permits) and AIS services (ELA and math support)  once placed in a monolingual class. Long term ELL students/Extension of Services students: are supported through a curriculum  embedded AIS program, instructional technology, small group instruction, and project arts enrichment.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Language instruction, linked to subject area teaching/learning, is crucial to the success of ELLs in achieving Cognitive Academic  Language Proficiency (CALP), in two languages. This year, the instructional focus of P396K is to incorporate multiple entry   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      points into all aspects of the students' instructional day.  By virtue of having an IEP and the additional support of Universal  Design for Learning  strategies, instruction is seamlessly differentiated for all of our ELLs.  In addition to the aforementioned  ENL strategies, our students are exposed to the following focusing strategies each month across grade levels and content areas  in the UNIQUE instructional program through the use of teacher developed instructional guides: turn and talk, think-pair- share, anticipatory guides, entry/exit slips, cooperative learning groups, and graphic organizers.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All of our ELLs also happen to be SWDs.  Through a rigorous team-based approach, our students are provided with a new IEP  on an annual basis.  Our related service providers make a substantial effort to push into the classroom so that students will not  lose valuable instructional time.  During push-in, while simultaneously working on academic skills and related service skills  (physical therapy, occupational therapy, vision, and speech services) the related service providers and ENL teacher have an  opportunity to share their expertise and learn from their Special Ed. counterparts. Our ELLs participate fully in all aspects of  instruction (UNIQUE, PBIS, GRTL, EQUALS, and the inclusion program) and extracurricular programs (Middle School After  School program, field trips, PBIS movie days, student council, a library program, a vocational program, a swimming program, a  music therapy program, a horseback riding academy, a bowling program/annual tournament, community service, Title III,  weekend "Family Fun days" and a summer program (Chapter 683).     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    We use the following interventions: ELA – Attainment, First Authour, SMILE, and WSS, Math – EQUALS, and Title III. At this  time, the language of ALL of our targeted intervention programs is English.  All of our teachers work collaboratively in  instructional cohort teams to develop next steps for how to support our students.  Our monthly instructional guides are used  in tandem with our school-wide rubrics to enhance the CCLS and deliver rigorous instruction that is differentiated for a diverse  group of learners.  Our newcomers receive support from a paraprofessional, tutoring, a buddy student, development of initial  literacy in their native language, and a nurturing environment to facilitate language production.  At this time we have two SIFE  students who are paired with an English proficient buddy to help them adjust to life in an academic setting.  Developing ELLs,  Long term ELLs, and Extension of Services students: are supported through a curriculum embedded AIS program, instructional  technology, small group instruction and project arts enrichment.  Students who no longer require Bilingual or ENL services  because they have tested out of the NYSESLAT, will be supported for up to two years with ENL (if scheduling permits) and AIS  services (ELA and math support) once placed in a monolingual class.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are expanding classes at out main site and 289 offsite in the following student-to-staff ratios: 8:1:1, 12:1:1, and  12:1:4.  Our school will open six new classrooms in the fall of 2017.  We made a request to the Director of the D75 office of  ELLs for an allocation for an additional ENL teacher.  In order to service both our bilingual and monolingual classes, we would  like to expand the music therapy program by having an additional music therapist work at the P.S. 289 offsite.  We are  extending our Middle School After School program (MSAS) to students in grade five school-wide.  We also plan to send eligible  ELLs who are in our inclusion programs to an inclusion based summer camp during the summers of 2018 and 2019  respectively.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Due to low enrollment, a decision was made by the D75 placement office to close our Spanish TBE class in the fall of the 2016- 17 school year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs participate equally in our instructional and recreational programs as compared to their monolingual counterparts.  For all  students, content area instruction is provided as follows: all subject areas are taught in English through ENL methodologies by  Special Education teachers who have completed the mandated 10 hours of 'Jose P. ESL training.'  In addition, our licensed ENL  teacher uses the integrated model as part of her teaching program to further support the practice of using ENL to teach  through the content areas.  Our ELLs have an opportunity to participate in all aspects of school programming, inclusive of: the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         music therapy program, inclusion program, student council, PBIS programs, after-school programs, horseback riding,  swimming, our vocational program and various field trips.  All ELLs are invited to participate in the supplemental Title III  program and families have the option of signing up for the free after-school program that we offer through UCP and MSAS.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The use of technology, inclusive of, hi-tech and low-tech augmentative communication devices such as  Big MAC's and multi-celled AAC devices paired with Mayor Johnson symbols, or SymbolStixs, VizZle,  Tarheel Reder, Interactive White Boards, classroom computers and iPads, and adapted switches are  incorporated into all aspects of our instructional and related service programs in order to give ELL  students additional instructional support.  Multi-sensory and multicultural ENL materials are infused  throughout all aspects of instruction.  HLA literacy materials such as De Canciones a Cuentos, Elefonetica,  Pan y Canela and and “My First Yiddish Word Book,” a new illustrated Yiddish dictionary for children by  Joni Kibort Sussman may be found in the TBE programs.  The use of bilingual dictionaries, software,  books, websites, and multimedia enhances and supports the development of home language  development and skills.  HLA literacy activities are extended throughout the curriculum and subject areas,  by combining the interdisciplinary/thematic approach with Language Experience, multi-sensory  approaches, the infusion of the arts, the use of technology tools, and augmentative communication.  To  comply with the New York City Literacy requirements, each classroom library contains books in the  students' home language, including those adapted by teachers to meet the needs of students with severe  disabilities.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our school offers a Yiddish TBE program, we provide alternate placement paraprofessionals to our students who are mandated  for TBE as per IEP.  Students in the TBE program are assessed in their home language regularly and routinely as a component of  their instructional program.  Classroom libraries contain books in the students' home languages, including those adapted by  bilingual teachers to meet the needs of students with severe disabilities.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All required services/resources are determined as per the student’s IEP.  IEPs are evaluated annually and triennially to  determine whether or not services should be decreased, increased or remain the same.  The ENL teacher is an integral part of  the IEP planning process, ensuring that we develop annual and triennial evaluations that will lead to the development of a  comprehensive IEP that prioritizes students' language needs, strengths, and next steps. Parents, a district representative and  related service members are all key participants in the IEP meeting.  As a best practice, appropriate age and grade level   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         materials are incorporated into all aspects of our instructional programs.  Our ELLs participate fully in the UNIQUE instructional  program and the school-wide PBIS programs.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In order to ensure that the academic, linguistic, and socio-emotional needs of our ELLs are met in our co-located buildings, we  make every effort to meet and plan in campus-wide teams consisting of Principals, A.P.s, and   We share common space such  as the cafeteria, gym, auditorium, and school playground as well as programs such as, PBIS.  In some locations, students may  have access to after-school programming within the Gen. Ed. building.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Project Jumpstart is not offered in District 75.  However, all of our newly admitted ELLs have an opportunity to participate in  our summer program (Chapter 683).  ELLs who come during the school year will be given a classroom buddy.  In addition, ELLs  in our inclusion programs will also have an opportunity to participate in a summer camp experience.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    N/A.

We do not have a dual language program., testify that the following ELL  identification procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64              Part VI: LAP Assurances   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      School Name:   We make every effort to sign our new teachers up for the 'Jose P. ELL training' that is provided by the D75 Office  of ELLS each year.  A record of staff members who have received Jose P. training is maintained by the school in the ELL Compliance  Binder  (Document  8).   In  addition,  the  school  will  ensure  the  attendance  of  bilingual,  ENL,  and  monolingual  teachers  and  paraprofessionals  at  district,  city  and  state  wide  conferences  focusing  on  the  education  of  ELLs.   All  teachers,  inclusive  of  monolingual, ENL, and bilingual teachers participate in instructional cohorts a minimum of two of more times per week where  they focus on strategies to improve student outcomes by looking through the lens of student work.  Teachers also receive ongoing  training on our assessment programs such as SANDI/FAST.  In addition, ALL teachers are required to participate in professional  development options of their own choosing each year and this is approved by our school Principal, Nira Schwartz-Nyitray.  The  Title III professional development will be provided to all teachers and paraprofessionals working in the program.  Participants will  each receive a schedule to attend the professional development workshops.   Topics for professional development for the ENL,  TBE, and support staff are included in our annual Title III program.  Our program will be held on the following dates - 1st and 3rd  Saturday of the following months: April 2018, May 2018, and June 2018.  This year we will offer the following options: our students  will explore soil composition, learn about fruits and seeds, roots and stems, and flowers and leaves.  The aforementioned topics  are aligned with the focus on listening, speaking, reading, writing as well as Math skills for students in K-8 NYSESLAT and NYSAA  assessments.

The LAC's  main responsibility is to  facilitate the provision of  language access services by  ensuring that everyone in  the school community is  aware of his/ her obligations  with respect to providing  language access and  assisting English Language  Learners (ELL) parents.  To  ensure that all parents are  provided with appropriate  and timely information in a  language they can  understand parents at our  school are required to  complete a Home Language  Identification Survey (HLIS)  upon initial enrollment at  the school building level if it  was not completed during  the initial intake process at  the Committee on Special  Education (CSE).  A trained  school staff member who is  a pedagogue meets with   Date (mm/dd/yy)  P396K believes that  effective parental  engagement is a key  indicator of student  success.  Joyce Epstein, a  noted researcher in the  field of parental  engagement has proposed  six Types of Parental  Involvement, "Parenting,  Communication,  Volunteering, Learning at  Home, Decision Making,  and Collaborating with  Community."  Our goal is  to increase parent  outreach and participation  by offering parents  continued training  throughout the school  year by engaging them  through the six types of  parental engagement as  highlighted by  Epstein.

Written  translation and/or oral  interpretation services are  provided by school staff  members such as bilingual  teachers and  paraprofessionals, and  alternate placement  paraprofessionals on a daily  basis at our school.  Formal  face-to-face meetings that  our school hosts with  parents include, but are not  limited to: annual and  triennial IEP meetings as  provided throughout the  year and overseen by an  IEP coordinator, Saturday  Family Fun Days (monthly),  parent-teacher conferences  (fall and spring), Parent  Coordinator events  (weekly), our Title III  program (spring),  Graduation (June) and ALL  District 75 sponsored parent  engagement events  (monthly).  In addition, the  speech department holds  monthly parent meetings to  demonstrate effective ways  that parents can enhance  communication skills and  activities with their  youngsters at  home.  Records for annual  individual meetings with ELL  parents are stored  electronically in SESIS and  hard copies are placed in  students' cumulative  records.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P396K has identified a Language Access Coordinator (LAC), our Parent Coordinator. The LAC's main responsibility  is to facilitate the provision of language access services by ensuring that everyone in the school community is  aware of his/ her obligations with respect to providing language access and assisting parents of English Language  Learners (ELLs). In order to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a  language they can understand, parents at our school are required to fill out Student Emergency Contact  cards/Blue Cards and to complete a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) upon initial enrollment at the  school building level if the HLIS was not completed during the initial intake process at the Committee on Special  Education (CSE). A trained school staff member who is a licensed pedagogue meets with the parents to complete  the HLIS, and an informal interview with the child and the parents is conducted with the assistance of interpreters   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      as needed in order to determine the child’s home language and subsequent eligibility for the New York State  Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL). Our ENL teacher uploads all HLIS documents into  SESIS. The information obtained from the HLIS is then entered into ATS as the parents' official home language.   In order to determine parental preference for written communication, we send home an informal parent survey  at the beginning of the school year that tabulates our parents’ preferred language for receiving written  communication. This information is also collected from the Student Emergency Contact cards/Blue Cards as well  as the HLIS. In addition, the school reviews incoming students' IEPs to ensure that the correct home language  information has properly migrated from ATS to SESIS. Students who arrive throughout the school year will  continue to be checked for an accurate home language determination as well as parental language preference  needs for written and oral communication through the use of the aforementioned systems.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of the school emergency, the school will follow the established procedures to reach the families of our  ELL students (via mail, e-mail, phone calls). At the beginning of the school year, after the parents/guardians fill out the  Blue Cards and/or Home Language Identification Surveys, we create a list of the preferred languages of  communication to make sure that we have Bilingual pedagogues and paraprofessionals who are proficient in these   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      languages. In case we do not have a staff member who speaks this language, the Language Access Coordinator will  contact the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit to request the interpreter/s.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      In order to be aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663, prior to the beginning of the school year ( the first  day in September when the school personnel report in), all staff members will be trained by the LAC/Parent  Coordinator. During this training, staff members will be updated about the most recent information from the LAP and  the LTI; they will also be provided with the contact information for the NYC DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      In order to fulfill Section VII of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation services, P396K posts signage in a conspicuous locations - at the main entrance and by  the safety agent's desk in each of the parents'/guardians' preferred languages detailing where the main office is  located and how parents/guardians can obtain notification of their rights regarding timely written translation and oral  interpretation services. We also display the multilingual welcome poster provided by the NYC DOE’s T&I Unit. Copies  of key documents, such as the Parents Bill of Rights can be found in the Parent room on the first floor of our main site;  all parents have access to this room. Furthermore, we provide parents/guardians with a copy of the Parents Bill of  Rights and the Expect Success Guide in a language that they can understand (in September).         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In reviewing school language access needs, our LAC/Parent Coordinator has determined that we should regularly  generate and review up-to-date ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for students and parents in our  school community throughout the year (e.g., RHLA and RCPL). Our LAC/Parent Coordinator will continue to track the  language preferences of all parents/guardians in our school community.   At the end of each school year, we ask parents/guardians of ELLs to fill out the end-of-the-year survey to gather  feedback on the quality and availability of services in order to create a plan of action to improve language services.  The LAC/Parent Coordinator then shares these findings with the school administration and leadership team who will  make the informed decisions about the further improvements of language services. At the beginning of the 2017-2018  school year, our LAC/Parent Coordinator and Family worker will disseminate a parent survey in order to gather  information from parents/guardians about their expectations of the language access services that our school  provides.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
