This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Brooklyn College Academy is a collaborative community of lifelong learners inspiring future leaders and nurturing  global citizens.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Brooklyn College Academy will be celebrating its 33rd anniversary this year. When our school opened, we set our  roots in alternative education. We were a middle college high school for students who needed special attention, care  and motivation to graduate high school. As the Department of Education changed, so did we. We developed our  school into a highly successful Early College High School with the support of collaborative partnerships with Brooklyn  College and national organizations such as Middle College National Consortium. Over the past eleven years, our Early  College program has grown exponentially and our students are graduating with more transferable college credits than  ever. As we reflect on our work, we can see that our school is fulfilling its mission of developing a highly effective  community of leaders and learners. We strive to include all members of our school community and develop their  innate leadership skills to forward our work.   As an Early College High School, we strive to provide a safe learning environment where students can connect with  their teachers and college professors. Our students need an environment where standards are high, are supported  both academically and emotionally, and where innovative pedagogical strategies help them learn and succeed. Our  guidance counselors and teachers t care for our students as if they were family. While providing for our students'  social and emotional needs, we also work hard to help develop college and career readiness skills that are necessary  in their future endeavors. This is done through our advisory program which is attached to the lower level college  courses we offer beginning in the sophomore year. This program teaches the soft skills college students need to be  successful. These skills include understanding a syllabus, speaking to and emailing professors, the importance of office  hours, and navigating a college campus. This work is extremely important to give our students a head start so that  when they enter college they an concentrate on their academics. We have found this to be a very successful model  that both the advisers and the students have built as a backbone of the Early College program.    We continue to work to provide our students with more extra-curricular activities. Last year we expanded our PSAL  program to include Girls Volleyball. We added clubs such as the chess club, acapella group, gospel group and a track  and field club to give students some of the enrichment they need. We intend to continue this trend this coming year  and continue to build this work as an outlet for our students and faculty.    As we move forward, we will continue to provide a high quality, well rounded, education for our students. We will  continue to uphold our high standards and teach our students to be outstanding and participating citizens and change  makers in our society.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   One population of students we will focus on this year is our special education program. Our ICT program has rapidly  expanded over the past two years and we are working to meet their immediate needs as well as integrating the  college experience that is the focus of our school. In 2018-2019 our ICT students will make up approximately 12% of  our student body. Their specific needs would include, but are not limited to, remediation, resource room, counseling,  and functioning ICT teacher teams. ICT teachers will have common planning time during the school day to facilitate  unit and lesson planning as well as implementing modifications as needed. Our special education coordinator will  work to ensure all necessary services are being implemented in each classroom as well as monitor student IEP's.    We will also be paying special attention at our ENL population as it continues to grow. In 2018-2019 our ENL students  have increased and we are working to meet their immediate needs as well as integrating the college experience. the  specific needs of our ENL students would include, but not limited to, remediation, ENL support classes, classroom  glossaries, extended testing time, and planning for day to day lessons to include access to the curriculum through  differentiated activities as well as translations when necessary. Our administrative team will work to ensure all  necessary services are being implemented in each classroom as well as monitor student progress.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Over the past year, we have made the most progress in the areas of Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment  and Collaborative Teachers according to the School Quality Snapshot and the School Quality Guide.    We have always held rigorous instruction high on our list of expectations for our classrooms. We have seen our Early  College Data, gathered by NCREST at Columbia University, stay consistently high. 98% of students are passing their  college classes. Additionally, and 105 of our seniors graduated with 30 or more credits, 33 of our seniors graduated  with 24 - 29 credits.   and 65 seniors graduated with 15 - 23 credits. Students participating in our Early College classes earned a total of  4,150 credits. We continue to offer approximately 35 class sections per semester and BCA students hold  approximately 600 seats each semester. Over the past six years 50% of our graduating students have matriculated  into CUNY. and 10% of our graduating students have matriculated into Brooklyn College. This year we continue to  offer the opportunity for college classes with the beginning of our Advanced Placement United States Government  and Advanced Placement English Literature classes for our junior and senior students. These classes are open to our  students with special needs and we are looking forward to the success of this new program.   Continuing to build on our strong supportive environment is a priority in our school. As evidenced by data for the  2017-2018 school year in the OSYD portal, particularly the number of incidents and suspensions, it is clear that our  school environment is focused on academics and supporting our students. We work very hard to be proactive rather  than reactive about issues students, teachers and/or parents may have throughout the school year. Guidance  counselors are assigned to each grade level and they move with their class through to graduation. This model allows  them to build strong relationships with our students and be proactive in their school life. Our goal is to create and  maintain safe environments and spaces so students and teachers can be at their best. We continue to work with our  school community in supporting our students and, as evidenced by our safety statistics, are successful in achieving  this goal. We lean heavily on our guidance counselors to take the lead in being proactive by building relationships with  their students. Our guidance counselors are available during lunch periods for students to talk with in the cafeteria  and this has helped our students become more comfortable building this important relationship.    Finally, the development of our Learning Leaders Team and the BCA Teacher Tech Team has allowed us to make great  progress in the area of Collaborative Teachers. These teams of teachers have the opportunity to participate in and  lead the professional development and technology work in our school. The Learning Leaders are responsible for the  development, direction, and programming of our professional development work. This team has been instrumental in  working together with the administration to implement more effective professional development that meets our  teachers’ needs and differentiates their learning. This team has been a wonderful aspect of our professional  development and provides teachers the opportunity to become leaders among their peers. The new BCA Teacher  Tech Team will be responsible for teaching our teachers about integrating technology into our classrooms. With our  students having limited access to hardware, this proves to be a challenge. This team is willing to take that challenge  on and help our teachers integrate Google Apps For Education, IO Education and more formative assessment tools in  their classrooms.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The Learning Leaders team conducted an analysis of our past work. They looked at student achievement in the form  of regents scores and classroom pass percentages as well as Early College class data compiled by NCREST at Columbia  University. In our professional learning communities teachers unpacked classroom assessments and compared that to  their classroom data. The Learning Leaders also collected anecdotal evidence from their colleagues.    The data we found is as follows:   - Our scores in the School Quality Guide for Rigorous Instruction over the past three years are 4.51 (2016), 4.47 (2017)  & 4.54 (2018)   - In the school year 2017-2018 61% of our students took college classes (NCREST).   - The average number of credits increased from 16.3 to 25.2 (NCREST)   - The average pass rate in those classes was 95% (C or higher) (NCREST)   - The average GPA was 3.35 (NCREST)   - Our regents exam data (passing percentages for scores at 65 and above) for the 2017-18 school year was as follows:  ELA 95%, Global History Transition 92%, US History 96%, CC Algebra 70%, CC Geometry 82%, CC Trigonometry 94%,  Earth Science 87%, Chemistry 70%, LOTE Spanish 94% (STARS)   As we continue to grow our rigorous academic environment we will continue our work:    - to begin alignment of curriculum to the Next Generation Standards    - to focus on implementing formative assessment tools for more precise targeted assistance.   At this time our strengths for this element include:    - Strong relationships within our faculty.   - A strong community of support for new teachers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      - Past topics explored in professional development include differentiated instruction and Understanding by Design,  will help teachers succeed in creating a rigorous academic environment   - Our Peer Review Program and Instructional Rounds Model will support teachers in their work to prepare students  for their Early College classes and beyond.    Our needs to help us succeed in this element:    - more frequent classroom intervisitation using the Instructional Rounds model   - teacher driven, goal oriented, professional development.   - teacher lead PLC's during professional development time focusing on formative assessment and teacher driven  goals.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, we will effectively increase the level of rigor across classes, as evidenced by a 2% increase in the average  number of students demonstrating college readiness (meeting CUNY standards for avoiding remedial classes) in student  achievement data, from 79% to 81%.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Beginning September 2018, teachers will begin the transition to  the Next Generation Standards. Teachers will use previous  classroom and school wide student achievement data (regents  exams, scholarship reports, early college data) to make these  decisions.    Beginning September 2018, teachers will take part in goal  oriented professional development that will increase their  content knowledge and improve the pedagogical decision  making processes to reach all learners. Teachers will meet in  PLC's to support academic rigor and professional goal  achievement in classrooms.   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?   Timeline  What is the  start and  end date?

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  We will engage families and support their understanding of rigorous instruction and the Next Generation Standards  beginning with our incoming freshman orientation night (June 2018) which sets the standards and expectations of our  incoming students. Families have the opportunity of interacting with the administration, teachers and guidance  counselors at the four scheduled open school events throughout the school year. "Meet Your Teacher Night" in  September allows all of our parents the opportunity to "walk" in their children's program, meet the teachers and  grasp the standards and expectations set in each class. We then host four grade level meetings for our parents  throughout the year in October, December, February and May. These meetings are relevant to the grade and include  topics such as college readiness, financial aid, beginning Early College, and other necessary topics.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Throughout the school year, we encourage reciprocal communication through the use of our Tuesday afternoon  parental contact time agreed upon with our teachers. We encourage to maintain constant contact with their parents,  especially those at risk of failing. We also make clear to our teachers that there is a distinct population of students  coming to us with high scores in academic classes in middle school. It is necessary for us to keep reciprocal  communication with their parents to continue to explain the high expectation of an Early College High School program  and give them the tools necessary for the success they are accustomed to. Lastly, our guidance counselors make it a  habit to consistently reach out to their students' parents to continue the conversations about social/emotional  growth as well as academics.    The key personnel for this goal include the Principal, AP Supervision, AP Guidance, AP Safety & Security, Teachers,  Guidance Counselors and the Parent Coordinator.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Brooklyn College Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part  A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Brooklyn College Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision    making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their    child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach,    communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of  the    school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses an literacy assessment created in house to gauge the early literacy skills of our ELL's. This information aids in  the implementation of the instructional plan by providing us with an idea of the literacy level the students are currently  working at. Teachers can then plan their differentiated lessons accordingly. To date our ELL students have achieved high scores  on the assessment. The insight it provides is that our ENL's speak English very well and can be successful in our school. The  data informs our instructional plan in that their programs are individualized for their needs and there are many layers of  support for them.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our special education team along with our guidance team and the school administration all collaborate to keep this effort in  place.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We look at our annual yearly progress, performance on regents exams, and performance in their content area classes.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our special education team along with our guidance team and the school administration all collaborate to keep this effort in  place.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   This is not applicable to our school     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels show that our ELL students are high achieving. They also come to us as high  achievers in their content area class as well.  As seen on the NYSESLAT, our students are on the verge of testing out and they  are making progress toward that goal.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   This information is disseminated to the special education team, the guidance counselors and the administration. We then  meet to discuss and implement adjustments to the programs for the future.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All ENL students are programmed for a comprehensive academic experience and a strong guidance component is  integral to the Brooklyn College Academy’s vision and mission. More opportunities to pass the required New York  State Regents exams are offered in the ninth and tenth grade allowing students to experience the Early College  program by eleventh grade. Intervention strategies for all of our students include extended tutoring time, extended  day school opportunities, Saturday school, attendance at community based organizations outside of school, and  supplemental tutor/mentor services. Our classes are all heterogeneous throughout all grade levels.  Our Integrated ENL instruction aims to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by  the content  area teacher and then supported by one of our Special Education teachers. We differentiate instruction  as to the level of student in each content area.  ENL's are grouped throughout each class and participate equally with  their peers.                     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not Applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Our teachers differentiate their instruction in all content areas.  Depending on the topic they are teaching and the difficulty  that          accompanies it, teachers group their students according to skill and learning levels. Our students are then placed into  homogeneous          cooperative working groups to support their students' learning. Teachers deliver all content area instruction in English.  Materials used in the program would include but are not limited to glossaries, dictionaries anddifferentiated worksheets  (translated when necessary). Support is provided by a special education teacher when necessaryand depending on the level of  the ENL student. All of our content area curriculum is in line with the Common Core Standards       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Data from ATS is examined to determine ELL status for our students. This data is reported to the testing coordinator who, if  necessary, will order exams in the students native language. ELL's are also provided glossaries for use during the school year.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.

Content area vocabulary books where students include vocabulary for a particular unit in each content area.  2. Audio books can be used when necessary to help students keep up with any readings in each content area.  3. Teachers differentiate instruction to give ENL students access pints to the curriculum.  4. Other support is provided by the service provider  5. Tutoring after school, when available, is provided to ENL students.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to attain their IEP goals.  Scheduling is individualized for each ENL  student and can include a period for extra support.  Curricular and instructional flexibility is provided by the content area  teacher through differentiation and related services support. Teachers are highly encouraged and are supported in giving all of  our ENL-SWD students the support necessary to achieve their IEP goals. Teachers are aware of the students' learning  modalities through access to the students' IEP via Skedula.  Content area teachers and  SPED teachers can then devise a plan to  help the student achieve their IEP goals and help them become more proficient in English.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Support services, for our freestanding ELL's, at Brooklyn College Academy include tutoring during the extended day period,  tutors working with students during class time, and support by the guidance counselors. If a student is in need of more  extensive support or services, more appropriate programs are investigated and offered.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new programs will be considered for this school year due to budgetary constraints.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs for our ELL students will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All eligible ENL students participate in extracurricular activities such as PSAL boys and girls basketball teams, clubs, community  service experiences, music programs, tutoring and school trips. Students must maintain certain criteria for participation in  specific activities as per New York City Department of Education protocol. We make school wide announcements, translated  when necessary, to students to invite participation to the activity either curricular and extra-curricular.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Presently the only foreign language offered in our school is Spanish. All of our ELL's have access to these courses. Our students  have been very successful in passing the New York City LOTE exam in Spanish after taking this coursework.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   This is Not Applicable to our school.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development meetings take place every Monday afternoon.  The dates for these meetings During this time,  teachers meet in Professional Learning Communities to discuss the academic goals of their students and how to better prepare  them to face the academic challenges of the Early College setting and today’s world. The Professional Learning Communities  also discuss specific pedagogical issues found in their classrooms, examine student data, and collaborate to improve upon  those issues. Students who are considered to be at risk or in need of additional services are discussed at these meetings and  action plans are created. The progress ENL students is also discussed and teachers can talk about methodologies that can work  toward the student making progress toward success in that particular content area.  Teachers are able to reach out to the  appropriate guidance counselors for help when necessary.    As DOE sponsored Professional Development is offered, we will send the appropriate representatives to those sessions.  Our  content teams including Special Education and ENL teachers, take part in weekly meetings and had a voice in aligning  curriculum and unit plans to the Common Core State Standards. Our weekly PD meetings focus on how formative assessment,  including those completed by ENL students, is helping to change pedagogy and predict performance on more standardized  department created assessments like midterms and finals.  Teachers use this time on Mondays be sure that they are on track  to complete units on time and that they are assessing all students, including ENL's, against the Common Core Standards.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         2. Our ELL students always have an adult to turn to in order to assist with their transition to our school. Their guidance  counselor, who stays with the student for three years, develops a deep relationship with the student is is always available for  any assistance necessary. Also, our Assistant Principal of Safety, faculty and administration all make it known to our students  that there is an open door policy and that they can come in and talk about anything they feel is necessary. Our school  community is supportive and nurturing of all of our students, especially our ELL students. The minimum hours of Professional  Development will be completed in house and may include a collaboration with another high school who has a more intensive  ELL program. The schools will collaborate on a PD plan to help all teachers better assist in the success of our program.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   These meetings are scheduled with the student's guidance counselor.  The counselor reviews the student's academic history to  date and then the progress made in all content areas the student is currently enrolled in.  If an interpreter is needed, we will  use someone on staff who speaks the language, reach out to Brooklyn  College for help or reach out to the interpretation unit  for assistance.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parental outreach and involvement is essential to the success of Brooklyn College Academy. PTA and SLT meetings are monthly  events. All members of the school community, staff, guidance and administration meet with parents upon request and  workshops are offered throughout the year. The school’s parent coordinator sponsors many workshops and opportunities  through which parents and students may achieve a better understanding of the opportunities Brooklyn College Academy  provides. School events are also planned during which parents can have the opportunity to discuss relevant issues with others.  Guidance schedules one to one conferences with  both parent and student, telephone conferences and activities to promote  the students’ well being and success.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nicholas Mazzarella, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Using ATS, the HLIS, student blue cards, and biographical information collected from students when entering the  school, we are able to assess our translation and oral interpretation needs. Announcements sent through our  grade reporting system are automatically translated for students and parents with a language prerference other  than English. Parents and students can request, through their child’s guidance counselor, translation and  interpretation services. This information is collected at the beginning of the school year so that appropriate  services can be implemented in a timely manner.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
