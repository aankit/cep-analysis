This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  We are guided by the following mission statement:   Section 4: CEP Overview      ● All students can master essential skills in reading, writing, and mathematics with the proper academic support.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      ● A rigorous, standards-based instructional program is necessary to prepare our students to excel in high school,  college, and the workplace.       ● Effective teachers train students to be independent thinkers and life-long learners.       ● Middle school students need clear, strict, and fair behavioral guidelines, as well as access to a strong support  network.       ● An inclusion model works best for special needs students      ● Strong connections between the school and the family and surrounding community are central to students’  academic success.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Community Action School (CAS) was founded in 1994, with a mission of providing a safe, rigorous education for a  diverse community of learners. It has continued to serve a primarily African-American and Latino student body. Most  students come from families who struggle economically: CAS has always been a Title I school, with the sector of  students receiving free lunch consistently averaging around 80%.    To conclude, these are some strong elements of extensive enrichment programs and multiple community  collaborations:    ● We use a 21 st Century grant to partner with the Urban Arts Program. This organization provides teaching artists for  our Dance Club, Anime/Comic Book Club, Chorus Club, STEM, Martial Arts Classes and Saturday Academy. NYCDOE  monies fund community service, Cross Country, Soccer, Baseball, Basketball and Math Club.       ● Community collaborations support essential elements of our social/emotional support structure.    - The Bereavement Project runs three cycles a year of therapy groups for students with deaths in their families.       - PFLAG, a support group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-gender people and their families, provide several  workshops year in all of our sixth and eighth grade classes.       - We share a mental health clinic with the other three schools located in the building.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      The school continues to seek out additional community-based resources to serve our students’ many needs.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   While our students have a broad range of academic levels, a high percentage of students entering our sixth grade  struggle in their literacy and mathematics skills. Additionally, our inclusion special education population is about 27%  of the student body.       In addition to our SETSS and ICT students whose services are provided in a full inclusion environment, we have a small  ACES class made up of approximately 10 cognitively impaired students who take alternate assessment NYS exams.       Our current ELL population is about 8% of our student body. These students receive support both within their ELA  classes and in small-group instruction depending on their English language proficiency skills. The majority of these  students need the most support in writing. The ENL teacher provides these students with the necessary skills in order  to successfully improve their writing skills in the English language.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the current school year, CAS continued to consolidate its strengths in several areas aligned with elements of  the Framework for Great Schools:    ● RIGOROUS INSTRUCTION: School leaders and the academic coaching staff chose 3C – Engagement and 3D – -  Assessment – as two focuses for the year. We felt that both were key leverage points for successfully engaging all of  our students in rigorous work. Mathematics and ELA teachers have been working on these two elements during the  past several years. Science and social studies are growth areas, where there needs to be improvement particularly in  the area of assessment and rigor of written tasks.       ● SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT: The school continues to have a very strong network for student support in both the  academic and social/emotional spheres. There is a strong advisory program; close relationships between staff and  students, fostered by administrative supports; and an active PPT. The school also used outside organizations to  support students’ developmental needs, including PFLAG (Parents and Families of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and  Transgender relatives), loss and bereavement support groups, Hunter Learning Lab tutors, and many other  community initiatives. This year’s area of growth is improving student’s academic and behavior skills through building  goal-setting structures and participation in the DOE Academic and Personal Behaviors Institute.       ● COLLABORATIVE TEACHERS – CAS teachers collaborate closely, supported by common preps, opportunities for  distributive leadership and strong administrative support. Included among weekly teacher meetings are the literacy  team, the math team, the science/social studies team, the pupil personnel team, grade teams and planning session  between general education/special education teaching partners. A focus for the current school year and moving  forward are protocols for analyzing student work for formative purposes, particularly midway through rigorous   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      performance tasks. These protocols are designed to provide data for class wide teaching shifts, as well as improving  differentiation of instruction.       ● EFFECTIVE SCHOOL LEADERSHIP – CAS school leaders provide supports for teacher success, including assistance  with classroom discipline, embedding common preps, budgeting for coaches in all core subject areas and managing  school funds so that essential instructional resources are not lacking. An essential component of leadership is  observation and follow-up guidance with staff. ADVANCE observations went well this year. They were well accepted  by staff and followed by observable instructional changes. The next steps for this year is to increase the amount of  support for teachers to leverage support in their instructional skills through better access to PD services and inter- visition within the school and with compatible partner schools.       ● STRONG FAMILY-COMMUNITY TIES – Many of our families have multiple stressors that limit their communication  with the school. At CAS, a key component of strong family-community ties has also been providing multiple scaffolds  for families, including a well-maintained online grading system, a culture of motivated teacher family outreach via  phone and email and employment of a committed and skilled family coordinator (ours have been associated with the  school for 23 of its 24 years of existence!). A growth area for the coming year is increasing the level of support  provided for our families to understand the rigorous requirements of the CCLS, and learn about ways that they can  support their children to excel in the midst of new learning challenges.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M258   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   223   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     During the 2017-2018 school year teachers implemented differentiation focused on discussion utilizing the strategies  given from an outside consultant. After review of data, the school found that math test scores were flat lined for the  bottom third and therefore want to focus strategies to create more access for these students.   The June instructional report indicates that across grade levels, constructed response questions scored lower than the  city average. By improving students’ ability to explain their thinking through targeted discussion and vocabulary  development, the school will improve these questions on the NYS Math Exam.   In addition, the school will continue to improve the rigor of performance tasks in units to reflect CCLS standards and  will be scored using those rubrics.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, the bottom third of students performing, in math, as measured by the NYS Math examination will  increase by 5% as a result of math curriculum revisions focused on vertical alignment, and increased student access to  differentiated instructional materials.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

Mr. Sullivan, Principal, and Ms. Sinnott, Assistant Principal, will continue to be very hands-on with the staff, attending  most teacher meetings, and making themselves accessible to staff for addressing any concerns, spending time in  teachers’ classrooms, and strategizing regularly with the academic coaching team.       Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Sinnott work together to leverage capacity for professional development and instructional  supervision by funding coaching staff for all core subject teachers (the coaches teach for part of their schedule and  provide instruction support for the balance of the week).       Mr. Sullivan and Ms. Sinnott will meet weekly with the coaching team to track progress and plan future initiatives.  Together, with CARP staff, the coaches assist teachers with unit planning, securing essential resources, and fine- tuning lesson plans in order to include highly rigorous academic discussion within the classrooms.      The principal and the AP will provide clear feedback and communicate next steps to staff after each ADVANCE  observation, but have not always been able to provide enough guidance on how teachers can continue to improve  their instruction practice in each competency area laid out in the Danielson Framework. With the research conducted  by the CARP team, a school-wide discussion rubric has been developed.

Community Action School received excellent feedback in areas of family engagement. Most parents agreed or  strongly agreed that the school did a good job communicating:   Student academic progress       Regularly communicate to meet student needs    Understand families’ concerns and specific situation      We believe that this is supported by the many channels/techniques/actions that scaffold parent involvement:     Calls and emails       Informal conferences  Family conferences         Hard and effective work by the school staff needs to continue and expand. Past conference numbers have been  relatively high – in the 80% range.      Anecdotally, however, parent attendance has been lowest with students who are showing lower levels of academic  success. We believe that this sector of our student population should be targeted to improve attendance at  conferences in the future.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The school attends citywide job fairs and utilizes the Open Market Transfer System to recruit job applicants. The  school principal also works closely with local universities to recruit qualified graduates in their schools of education, as  well as with the Teaching Fellows and Teach for America programs. Job applicants are interviewed by a committee of  teachers and supervisors, and are required to conduct a period-long demonstration lesson.       The BEDS survey for the 2017 – 2018 school year indicates that all teachers are highly qualified in their assigned areas  of instruction.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   - The school has a corps of three curriculum coaches – literacy, math and social studies/science – who are receiving  ongoing training in CCLS standards and related best practices. This professional development is being providing by  trainers from the Teacher Incentive Fund program.       - Collaborative curriculum planning meetings are held weekly for the literacy, mathematics and social studies/science  teams. Common preps allow all instruction staff, including special education teacher, to attend one or more of these  sessions. The school’s weekly 80 minutes of extended day collaborative meeting time is dedicated to CCLS-related  issues as well. During all of these meetings, the school’s coaches and Network curriculum specialists provide  workshops, and teachers share best practices.       The school provides per session funds for additional curriculum planning sessions for its staff, and offers funds for  teachers to attend off-campus conferences and trainings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35       Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Prior to the first day of school the teachers and administration meet in department area teams to discuss multiple  assessment measures. Included in the meeting is a copy of each teacher’s curriculum map that includes the  assessments the students are going to be taking throughout the year. Also discussed are the city and state-wide  measures that the students will have to take, as well as the assessments the committee decided upon when deciding  what the Measure of Student Learning was going to be for each grade and department.    Lastly, at the meeting the teachers and administration go over each department’s baseline assessment. Teachers  track student progress using many different methods including baseline/midyear/end year assessments, individual  student portfolios, online grade-book, and through ongoing teacher observations. Teachers have received  professional development in regards to how to use the information created to further drive their instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.   Parent and Family Engagement Policy   The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of   parents and community in the school. M258 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary   and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to   strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s   policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of   the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent   Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   M258 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,   literacy, math, and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments.   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in   languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all   Parental Involvement and School Quality   parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The   school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement   policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school   surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and   enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the   school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership   Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for   additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I   program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title   I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent   Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support   and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.   The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the   parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and   inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents   each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,   grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and   technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review   Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act; ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g.,  quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, to share information about the  school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; ●  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; ● conduct  an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that  address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school   activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,   and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Expanded Learning Time focuses on improving student skills in the area of Literacy and Mathematics.   Also, student will have an opportunity to participate in a variety of after school programs such as   Drama, Chorus and Martial Arts.      Programs such as Saturday Academy, After School Tutoring and Enrichment classes will provide   opportunities for student success.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    RIGOROUS INSTRUCTION -   By June 2019, the bottom third of students performing, in math, as measured by the NYS Math examination will  increase by 5% as a result of math curriculum revisions focused on vertical alignment, and increased student access  to differentiated instructional materials.       SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT -    By June 2019, students will exhibit an increase in their sense of belonging in the school community. This will be  measured by the Student Mindset Survey Report administered through the Academic and Personal Behaviors  Institute (APBI) and with reinforced through regular cycles of the Restorative Circles curriculum. The average score  in the “belonging” area of the survey will increase by 5% between the fall 2018 and the spring 2019 administration.          COLLABORATIVE TEACHERS -   By 2019, due to increased collaboration between general ed and special ed teachers there will be a 5% reduction in  the amount of students with disabilities/ENL earning a level 1 as measured by the NYS ELA assessment scaled  scores.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      EFFECTIVE SCHOOL LEADERSHIP -    Through support from administration and instructional coaches, teachers will show growth in the skills laid out in  Danielson Component 3B - Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques. The Collaborative Action Research (CARP)  Team will provide ongoing professional development to teachers throughout the school in the area of improving  questioning and discussion techniques. Staff performance in Danielson Component 3B, as measured by evaluative  CARP discussion resources, will increase by an average of 5%.     5. FAMILY ENGAGEMENT - By June 2018, 90% of families will have participated in two   cycles of student-led conferences and, as a result, report card averages for the bottom third   performing students will rise by 5%.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The school administers the QRI VI and STAR reading assessments to all students. Based on the results of these assessment  tools, educators will design lessons that reinforce student strengths and improve student weaknesses. Teacher-created  assessments are also being used to guide the ENL teacher in her instruction of the current and former ELLs. ELLs can be further  supported, areas in need of instructional support, both inside the classroom, or out, depending on the student's level of  English proficiency.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ELLs are clustered in each grade. This allows the ENL teacher to extend her time with each group of students. A select  group of teachers conduct the QRI VI testing each year, and STAR reading assessments take place several times per year in the  ELA classrooms. This data is shared with the ENL teacher, and together, both the ENL teacher and content teachers decide the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      necessary steps in developing appropriate goal-oriented assessments. Teacher-created assessments are delivered in small  group instruction time when ENL students work closely with the ENL teacher to improve areas of growth.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  NYSESLAT or NYSITELL results are reviewed by the ENL teacher. Based on this information, and the results of diagnostic  examinations given at the start of the year, the ENL teacher helps students to develop ENL-specific goals. This information is  then relayed to the student's content area teachers, and, said information, is used to bolster student success both inside and  outside of the classroom. Students are reassessed, using teacher-created assessments, at various points throughout the year.  These results are compared to the preceding scores. If progress is not being made it is discussed at a weekly meeting among  the ENL teacher and the content area teachers. The educators determine how to it is best to support the struggling student.  These assessments help to diagnose student strengths and weaknesses that drive instruction. Tracking long-term trends of  achievement among ELL population informs both instruction and educators.    The majority of students have shown a strong need in writing growth. The majority of ELL support will be focused on  improving writing skills. The diagnostic, NYSESLAT, and NYSITELL results have also indicated a need for vocabulary  development. These focus areas have been shared with all teachers that work with the ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    ELL students, both former and current, develop personal goals based on their results on the NYSESLAT, formative, and  summative assessments. These goals are updated throughout the year and shared regularly with the content area teachers.  This information is shared during weekly meetings between content area and ENL staff. This process allows for the ENL  teacher, the content area teachers, and the students to be aware of the progress taking place and current goals throughout  the year. The ENL teacher provides the full-staff with professional learning opportunities, four times per year, that focus on  specific strategies that can be used in the content-area classroom in order to support the ELLs in their learning. These  strategies are selected based on the specific needs of the ELLs. At these meetings, the ENL teacher shares best practices and  ELL-specific strategies that can enhance student performance.    The ENL teacher makes herself fully available to any and all content area teachers that feel the need to co-plan. Teachers are  made aware of these opportunities via email(s).     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   At-risk ELLs in grades 6-8 are provided with the necessary interventions when appropriate. Upon identification, students are  given proper supports. For example, students that are emerging are provided with helpful images of critical vocabulary words  within lesson plans in the content area classes. They are also provided with sentence starters, graphic organizers, and both  verbally and written instructions. These students are also placed with a "buddy" that possesses a stronger knowledge of the  English language. The "buddy" can re-explain when necessary, and serve as a further support system for the student at-risk.    Again, content area teachers, are encouraged to meet with the ENL teacher in order to embed appropriate supports. These  supports should be removed as the student progresses. Progress is assessed and checked throughout the academic year.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Performance on both the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams reveal that the majority of ELLs are expanding or commanding  regardless of grade level. This is with the exception of one student who is performing at an emerging level. Based on these  scores, students are provided the appropriate units of study delineated in CR Part 154.2 for ENL programming.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher works with the administration, and the parent coordinator, to find the most appropriate setting for each  child. The ELLs, for the most part, are clustered in order to make scheduling possible and much more succinct.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52           The ENL teacher, based on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results, using the CR Part154 state mandates, determines how many  minutes of services are needed for each child. The ENL teacher develops an appropriate schedule for these students based on  these mandated minutes. 6th grade ELLs are clustered in class 602. 7th grade ELLs are clustered in class 701. 8th grade ELLs, all  of whom are former ELLs, are broken into class 801 and 802. Any newly identified ELLs are placed in the classes accordingly.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The school provides instruction to ELLs in heterogeneous groups. Instruction is provided in both integrated and stand- alone environments, including expanding ELLs. The ENL teacher provides at least the number of minutes mandated  for students at each level of proficiency. CAS has one emerging level student. This student is provided 360 minutes a  week through an integrated model in his 12-1 class. The sixth grade has two expanding students and one former ELL.  These students are serviced through their ELA teacher who holds both a TESOL and content area certification. These  students also receive the support of the ENL teacher. The seventh grade has one expanding ELL and four former ELLs.  The current ELL is provided with 180 minutes a week through the ENL teacher. The former ELLs are provided with a  minimum of 90 minutes/week. The eighth grade has three former ELLs. These students are provided with 90 minutes  of service per week. Since the majority of the current ELLs at CAS are expanding and commanding they are grouped  by grade level. The one exception is the student in the 12-1 class. He is serviced based on his needs. A fully integrated  model is best fit for his individual needs.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students' mandated services are identified by reviewing achievement data in the ATS NYSESLAT report. The ENL teacher then  reviews her/her schedule with the principal and plans a program that meets all mandates. When necessary, services are  provided in an integrated modality based on the proficiency levels of the current and former ELLs. CAS has three emerging  level students. Two of these students have a unique situation. He is provided with 360 minutes per week. However, these  minutes are provided through an integrated model as this best fit their needs. The third emerging student, a seventh grader, is  provided the necessary minutes through an integrated model in ELA and several stand alone sessions that take place in a  separate location. Four sixth grade ELLs are expanding, and they are provided with the allotted 180 and 90 minutes per week  from both the ELA/ENL certified teacher and the ENL certified teacher. The two commanding sixth grade students also  receive the mandated minutes through both the dual-certified ELA teacher and the ENL certified teacher. The seventh grade  and eighth grade ELLs (current/former) are also provided with the allotted 180 or 90 minutes of service depending on whether  they are expanding or commanding in the English language.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area instruction is provided in English, with support from the ENL teacher and, with the ENL teacher's assistance,  other members of the school staff. All ELLs are placed in the same academic sections on each grade level, which maximizes the  instructional capacity of the ENL instructor. During stand-alone times, the ENL teacher provides assistance, in English, with  academic vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills necessary for successful performance in core subject classes.  Through discussions and analysis of assessments given in the content area classes, the ENL teacher, with help from the specific  content area teacher, develops appropriate lessons that boost the skills used in those classes. For example, if our emerging 7th  grade ELL is struggling in his math class, the ENL and math teacher will work together to identify which skills need growth. The  ENL teacher will, using graphic organizers, images, video, sentence starters, and explicit instruction, help to boost those skills.  The skills taught during stand-alone are based on the data mentioned above. As appropriate, other instructional personnel,  including the AIS teacher, community-based volunteers, and tutorial programs are used as additional resources. The ENL  teacher works with the core subject teachers to modify the materials they use in class. All ELLs are responsible for the content  taught in their core subject classes. However, the way in which this material is presented or evaluated differs based on the  individual student needs. The sheltered English method is used. All lessons, provided by the ENL teacher contain both a  language and content objective.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The ENL teacher administers bench marked assessments three times during the academic year. ELLs are encouraged to  respond in their home languages prior to attempting to share in English. They are also encouraged to discuss potential  responses with students that share their home language. As stated above, emerging students are placed with a language  "buddy" in the content area classrooms. Students also have access to Chromebooks and iPads. Several libraries throughout the  school contain books in other languages. The ENL teacher also has access to bilingual dictionaries. Students are always  welcome to use these tools.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Currently, the school has both newcomer and long-term ELLs on its register, and ELLs are receiving both integrated and stand- alone instruction. The three newcomers attended school outside of the United States. Two of these students have relatively  strong reading and writing skills. Both of these students are expanding according to the NYSITELL results. Among their growth  areas have been academic vocabulary and grammatically accurate sentence structure. The ENL teacher is closely tracking  classroom materials, and providing targeted instruction in key vocabulary. The teacher is also focusing on strengthening these  students' writing skills, utilizing writing tasks assigned in core subject classrooms. The third newcomer has recently arrived  from Puerto Rico. He has tested as emerging based on the NYSITELL. He is being provided with both integrated and stand- alone ENL services. The ENL teacher has also reached out to all 7th grade teachers, provided them with the necessary  information to boost his English language skills, and has opened up her planning time to any teacher that feels this would be  beneficial for their lessons.  We have found that most of the school's long term ELLs have additional learning issues that impact their language  development. The ENL teacher works closely with the academic intervention teacher and, when appropriate, with the special  education staff to identify and address gaps in the development of academic skills.  The school has one developing ELL at this time. This student will receive modified core classroom materials and lessons. It is  important that this student follows the classroom content in their core subject areas. This ELL is also being given the  appropriate ENL support settings. This is dependent on his English proficiency level(s). The ENL teacher has, in order to bolster  his success, focused on pre-teaching concepts and vocabulary as well as reinforcing concepts that will be covered in the core  subject classrooms. He is also being taught the necessary skills in order to be successful in their content area classes.  The school has no SIFE students at this time. However, SIFE students would receive an even further modified curriculum. The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      goal of the ENL teacher would be to provide support to all classroom teachers servicing the SIFE student(s). It would be  absolutely essential that all administrators, advisers, classroom teachers, support personal, etc. be aware of the students  history. Creating an environment of academic success and support would be the ultimate goal for the SIFE student(s).   CAS has quite a number of former ELLs. These students receive at least 90 minutes of service per week as per CR Part 154.2  This service is provided through an integrated model in the students' ELA classes. Based on NYSESLAT results, and updated  diagnostic exams, it has been determined that these students would, and do, benefit most in an integrated ELA class. All  content area teachers are aware of which students are considered former ELLs. These students, at times, are provided with  modified instructional supports of assessments. But, for the most part, these students are pushed to complete grade-level  appropriate work.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   In order to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development, teachers of ELL-SWDs use  grade-level appropriate leveled materials, modified lesson plans/activities/assessments, RTI (response to intervention), a focus  on the needs of each individual student (student areas of growth), and making this information accessible for the use of all  classroom teachers. Student goals are updated regularly and readily shared with all teachers that play a role in the academic  growth of the student(s).     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL teacher works closely with the ICT and SETSS staff to share data and intervention strategies. The ENL teacher provides  integrated support, in alignment with the school's inclusion model of special education instruction. Stand-alone instruction, for  emerging and transitioning level students, is primarily provided during the school's 135 minutes a week of independent  reading as well as during classes that are not part of the core curriculum.        ELL-SWDs are placed in the appropriate ICT or SETSS classes. These students, being clustered, can receive ENL services  simultaneously.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Since our goal is to make students reach proficiency in English, we make sure that we provide appropriate materials to support  the ELL population.  Our ELL populations are supported by using leveled libraries in Spanish and English, tiered materials for  whole-class reading and listening centers. The teachers also use the balanced literacy writing program where they plan for  academic language, use stages of language acquisition, utilize scaffolding strategies, and integrate content and language  objectives in planning for instruction.     If the child is emerging in his/her English language proficiency, he/she is serviced in a smaller group where more individualized  attention is given to meet his or her academic needs. For newly arrived students, teachers also invest a significant amount of  time introducing the student to the new culture, school, customs and basic conversational skills. Students are mentored by  one of their peers who will help them with daily routines and schools’ expectations.  We have specific materials that will  support the students’ academic needs. These materials are differentiated versions of the originals.     Many of our long-term ELLs also qualify for AIS and are students with special needs. The ENL and AIS teacher will examine their  test history and communicate with the classroom teachers to identify the specific needs of the child, which is often mastering  the academic language. A large proportion of our long-term ELLs need additional support in the writing modality on the  NYSESLAT and ELA. We use Judith Hochman’s Basic Writing Skills curriculum for upper grades to support writing in all content  areas, while we provide targeted intervention in areas of growth identified by writing rubrics in ELA and content areas classes.  In addition, developing mastery of the academic language, another area of growth of many of our long-term ELL’s, promotes  improvement of writing skills.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      ELLs set their own ENL writing goals based on the work they produce during a diagnostic, or baseline, assessment at the start  of the school year. These goals are revisited throughout the year. Adjustments are made based on any academic changes that  occur. These goals are also shared with all teachers that teach these students.     Along with integrated support, most of our ELLs receive supplementary instruction in a smaller groups where more  individualized attention is given to meet his or her academic needs, using some of the methods listed above.      Students who have passed the NYSESLAT (former ELLs) receive support by the ENL teacher for a half unit/week and, in some  cases, by the school’s AIS instructor.     ELLs also receive support in mathematics, social studies, and science classes. There are two teachers in all of these classes, and  the ENL teacher works with them to make sure that instruction is aligned with ELLs language development needs. This support  is provided through differentiated small group work, targeted assistance with writing assignments, and scaffolding of oral  presentations and participation in accountable classroom discussions.  The ENL teacher also confers regularly with the child -  and the core subject teacher - about vocabulary and other challenges they face in specific units, so that these can be  addressed in her small group sessions. Finally, the ENL teacher provides professional support to these content area teaching  partners through participation in department meetings and in full-staff PDs during afterschool collaborative meeting sessions.  The ENL teacher provides the full staff with targeted strategies four times per year in 45 minute meetings after school.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on formative and summative assessments throughout the 2016-17 school year, the ENL teacher will implement a  teacher-made vocabulary program in the ENL curriculum for the upcoming year. Students will be asked to work deeply with  several new grade-level academic words per week becoming an expert on each through multiple exposures. Students will also  be participating in dialogue journals. This will allow the students space to write freely on topics of their choosing. This will help  to strengthen teacher-student relationships as well as bolster the needs of each individual student's writing skills as a result of  what it produced in each journal.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All school enrichment and supplementary intervention programs are open to the school's ELLs. These include both school-and  community-based options, including:   - After school "homework club" for all grades  Students are welcome to stay with designated teachers to work on areas of need and/or missing work, etc.    - Regents mathematics class for eighth grade students    - Saturday Academy intervention program  Saturday Academy introduces students into a supplemental curriculum in order to boost ELA and mathematics skills and  understandings.    - Community-based Top Honors mathematics tutorial    - A large menu of after-school enrichment activities, including drama, photography, visual arts, chorus, yoga, community  service, basketball, soccer, cross-country running and baseball.     Teachers, administration, and the parent coordinator work together to ensure that these activities are equally accessible to all  students, and do outreach to families in their home languages. The ENL teacher further communicates the importance of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      joining and/or being part of extracurricular activities. The ENL, and all staff, can provide further explanation to all ELLs and any  student about the clubs and services offered by CAS.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Chromebooks are used in all classes. Google Classroom, and all Google platforms and add-ons, are used by the majority of  teachers at CAS. All subgroups of ELLs: commanding, expanding, transitioning, and emerging, have access to iPads. In  necessary, emerging and transitioning students can carry these iPads from class-to-class in order to access translations from  English to the native language or vice versa. Based on the needs of each ELL, students have access to useful apps on the iPad.  The apps used throughout the year are determined on a need-be basis. All ELLs use Google Docs, Google Slides, Kahoot, etc. in  order to further develop their proficiency in the four English language modalities (reading, writing, listening, speaking.) All  classrooms also have Promethean Boards to ensure that students are receiving oral and visual instructions. Emerging,  transitioning, and expanding students have access bilingual dictionaries that can be used in their core content area classes:  ELA, mathematics, social studies, and science.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Upon entering the NYCDOE system, students are given the LAB-R. This exam assesses the students language abilities in the  Spanish language.   ELLs are also provided access to multi-lingual libraries. Chromebooks and iPads can be set in the student's native language.  Emerging and transitioning ELLs are also assigned a buddy within their core content area classes. This buddy can help to re- explain or guide the emerging or transitioning student. These buddies, if possible, share a common native language.   Students are also encouraged, within the stand-alone ENL class to respond in their native language if necessary.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All ELLs are supported in their content area classes. The ELLs receive support through the content and special education  teachers. The ENL teacher provides these teachers with targeted strategies that can be used to boost ELL proficiency levels and  support their areas of growth. The ELLs also receive support through small group instruction during independent reading  periods and/or classes that are not a part of the core subject areas. Working with the core subject area teachers, the ENL  teacher delivers the necessary strategies students need in order to be successful in the content area classes. Materials are  modified or leveled to make them more accessible. All lessons are aligned to grade appropriate NYS Learning Standards.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The school invites the families of all new sixth grades students, including ELLs, to come to the school over the summer to meet  with school staff and have their children take the QRI IV language assessment. Families of ELLs who start at the school after the  beginning of the year are also asked to come in for a meeting with the parent coordinator, ENL teacher, and principal or  assistant principal to receive an orientation on the school's expectations, academic program, and special activities. New  students meet with the ENL teacher, a grade team leader, and a member of the administration to learn about the school  program. During the meeting staff assess the student's social and emotional needs and plan provision of appropriate supports.  New students are also paired with a student guide. This partnership ensures that the new student receives the information on  a peer-level as well.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Using Duolingo Classroom, the school provides Spanish language instruction for eighth grade students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All staff will received professional development regarding the specific needs of ELLs during the school's weekly extended day  professional development sessions four times per year. The ENL teacher provides the staff with effective strategies that could  easily be implemented in all content area classes in order to support the ELL population. Teachers are also encouraged to  attend outside professional development meetings that focus on ELL topics.    The ENL teacher will also attend weekly meetings of the school's literacy team and share her perspective on the learning  challenges and advantages experienced by English Language Learners.    The ENL teacher attends MFSC ELL Leads professional development meetings throughout the school year. She is also highly  encouraged to attend outside professional development meetings. This year, she will be attending the 2018  TESOL International Convention in Chicago, IL.    Engagement in integrating CCLS in instruction is central to planning in all curriculum areas. See response to above prompt.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher attends all District 3 ELL leads professional development meetings that take place throughout the year. She  also attends professional development meetings offered by the UFT, and other organizations, as often as possible. She will also  be attending the 2018 TESOL International Convention this March in Chicago, IL.     All teaching staff are given four ENL strategy meetings per year (10/2, 12/11, 3/12, 5/7). Records will be kept in the form of  training agendas and faculty sign-in sheets. They are also encouraged to attend the same professional development meetings  that the ENL teacher attends. The staff members are sent ELL-specific professional development opportunities as they make  themselves available to the ENL teacher and/or administration. Staff members are aware that they must satisfy 15% of the  professional development hours with a focus on ELL-specific topics. Agendas and CTLE credit is individually stored.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58            Starting at the beginning of October, the ENL teacher, Ms. Mary Phelan, makes appointments for one-on-one meetings with  families of all of her/his students. Interpretation is provided either by a qualified member of the school staff or by phone link  with the Department of Education's Language Interpretation Team. The ENL teacher works with the school's parent  coordinator to make sure that this communication occurs in the format most available for each family, preferable in person or  by phone. During these meetings, parents are informed of language development progress, language proficiency assessment  results, and language development needs in content area classes. A formal record of ELL parent preference is kept in the  student's permanent record. A record of annual/informal/formal meetings with ELL parents is kept in the ENL teacher's office.  These are kept as running records. The ENL teacher keeps notes of ELL parent-teacher meetings in the file of each of her  students.      If parent(s) cannot attend the in-person meeting, an over-the-phone meeting will take place. The same information will be  discussed as mentioned above, and the ENL teacher will take note that the meeting was held via telephone.     On-going email communication in regards to progress and student needs will take place throughout the school-year.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The school's parent coordinator works with the ENL teacher to encourage families of ELLs to attend Parent Association  meetings and to be involved in other school functions, including eighth grade high school orientation, family workshops  provided by the Urban Arts Program, and School Leadership Team meetings.      ELL parents are also invited to two yearly meetings that provide them with their child's language proficiency results based on  state exams, progress that is being made, ways in which they can better support their child's needs, etc.     The ENL teacher also provides parents with adult-ed learning opportunities provided within NYC. For example, English courses  for adults, etc. On-going email and telephone communication fosters strong relationships between parents and the ENL  teacher.    In October/November, the ENL teacher, as mentioned above will conduct 1 of 2 annual ELL-parent meetings.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    High school and college preparedness is infused into the school's curriculum at all grade levels. Additionally, ELLs will be provided  with appropriate support during the eighth grade high school application process, including interpretation for parent meetings and  articulating with "best fit" schools for individual student's needs.                          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Andrew Sullivan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   MS258, Community Action School                                                                              School DBN: 03MS25  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
