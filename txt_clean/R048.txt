This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS/IS 48 is dedicated to the belief that all students can meet high standards of excellence.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 school year, we made progress in the area of Strong Family-Community Ties. In the area of  outreach to parents 96% of families that they were well informed by the communication they receive from their  school.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy         Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 048, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.   The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community. P.S. 048 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;            Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

We propose a two fold plan to address the needs of the entering and  emerging ELLs as well as ELLs who scored a 1 or 2 on the ELA exam in grades 3-8.   In light of these findings, our school has decided to employ a research based program known as  RAZ-PLUS, which delivers printable and technology enabled resources that support teacher led  instruction, independent student practice, formative assessment and detailed reporting to improve  the reading skills of students at all developmental levels. This program is accessible during the  school day as well as at home. One component of the enrichment program is to teach parents and  students how to utilize RAZ independently.  The first portion of the program would utilize the software RAZ-PLUS. This program would  consist of students from grades K -8 . The students in this target group would be at the Entering  and Emerging levels and would also benefit newcomers in the older grades.  It would be taught  by 2 certified ENL teachers. One of the ENL teachers also holds a certification in Special  Education.  The program would run for 1 and half hours on a Wednesday and would be split into 4 groups.  Each group will service a bridge of 2 grades and each group will run for 3-4 weeks each.  Kindergarten will run November 28, December 5, December 12 and December 19. Grades 1 and  2 will run January 2, January 9, January 16 and January 23 and January 30th  Grades 3 and 4 will  run , February 6, February 13 and February 27 and March 6th. Middle school grades will run  March 6, March 20 and March 27 ,April 3, April 10th and April 17th.  Students will also be able  to access the program from home to receive additional remediation and would be able to  continue using the program throughout the rest of the academic year.  The second part of the program would be a Saturday Writer's Academy targeting students in  grades 3-8. Students in this program would be those who earned a 1 or 2 on the previous year's  E.L.A. exam or that are on a Transitioning or Expanding level on the NYSESLAT. There will be  4 cohorts:  grade 3, grade 4, grades 5/6 and grades 7/8.  This program would run for 2 hours for 5  weeks beginning in the month of March.  These students would be serviced by a content area teacher in conjunction with a certified ENL  teacher who would push into classes to provide any necessary scaffolding and support that the  students and/or teachers might require. The students in this program would be working with the  writing portion of both RAZ-PLUS software and  "Finish Line For ELLs" workbooks.  All records will be maintained in the ENL coordinator's office.

These teachers will turn key this training during a two-part  Saturday professional development series prior to the start of Saturday Writer's Academy.  Teachers will have the opportunity to navigate and utilize the different components of Raz- Plus as well as to co-plan with the ENL teachers to assure that the proper scaffolding techniques  are employed.  These trainings will take place on Saturday February 2nd and February 9th. Topics to be covered  will include: navigating the program, setting up students, assessing lesson plans and resources,  assessments, and assigning work for home.  The teachers will also be assisted in accessing the resources that the DOE Common Core Library  offers for strategies and supports for ELL students.  The ENL teachers will also  meet weekly  with classroom teachers to discuss how they can incorporate what the students are working on in  RAZ Kids and Imagine Learning into daily instruction to support ELL students.   In order for the ELL students to have the best possible experience utilizing RAZ-PLUS, the  teachers must be well versed in using the program. Therefore, professional development is a  crucial component.  Copies of  agendas and attendance sheets will be maintained in the ENL coordinators office.   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

The first step would be to involve the  school's language access coordinators who are, in this case, Terry Guthrie our parent coordinator  and Christine Vitale our ENL coordinator. They would begin by running a preferred language  report in ATS.  In continuation, they would have documents translated and have the language and interpretation  unit assist in any phone calls that needed to be placed.  Once all language needs were met,  parents, who would be participating in the programs, are then invited in for an information  session which would be given by both ENL teachers Teresa Ciaramella and Christine Vitale.  Parents will be invited to partake in an information session regarding all aspects of the program  and to discuss any questions or concerns that might arise. Parents will be taught how to have  their children log-in to the programs at home and will be invited to a celebration at the end of  Saturday Academy to update them on the progress of their children.  Christine Vitale would be involved with parents again for securing any interpretation needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52                  Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Copies of all agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations in parents preferred language will be  maintained in the ENL coordinator's  office   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Currently, PS/IS 48 utilizes the Fountas and Pinnell as the tool for assessing early literacy skills. This assessment is administered  to every student in the school. Data extrapolated from this tool provides insight on ELL performance in the areas of fluency,  accuracy, and comprehension. For the kindergarten and first grade levels, this assessment also reveals ELL performance for  word attack skills as well. The classroom teacher utilizes this information to differentiate her instruction for the ELLs in his/her  classroom.  This information is also shared with the ENL teachers so that they might focus on key areas of weakness during their small  group instruction. In conjunction with DRA scores, the ENL teachers carefully examine NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores when  planning their instruction as well. Data patterns found from the DRA reveal that the deficits in phonemic awareness of  entering and emerging ELLs leave them with far less word attack strategies than their English speaking peers. With this in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      mind, both the ENL and the classroom teachers incorporate strategies to better equip these students to increase performance.  Additionally, we will use the Common Core state standards as a baseline measure. We will assess students three times per  year to see if they meet, exceed or are below state standards. Students will be grouped by their Fountas and Pinnell levels for  small group instruction based on the continuum of literacy learning. Teachers will plan instruction based on the skills or  strategies needed specific to the level of literacy individual students are on.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In conjunction with the administration and school's impact team, a protocol was put in place for data collection. This schedule  is shared with staff through Google Docs in order for teachers to prepare for timely submission allowing for all members to be  appraised of findings. ENL teachers are form part of the many teams that analyze data and extrapolate findings. The ENL  coordinator has access to ATS and works in close conjunction with the testing coordinator. In this way NYSESLAT results are  immediately shared with all ENL teachers to disseminate to both parents of ELLs as well all staff dealing with these students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  As we believe that a holistic approach of evaluating our program, PS/IS 48 is committed to excellence and we understand that  we must grow and change every year to meet the ever changing needs and challenges of our students. With this in mind, all  venues are explored (report cards, formal (NYSESLAT and DRA) and informal assessment (teacher created tests and on- demand writing pieces), teacher and parent interviews, needs based surveys, and feedback given to us from our Parent  Coordinator who conducts outreach to determine the success of our ELL programs.  Our parent coordinator is in close contact  with our ELL families and is a voice for these families. If adjustments need to be made to programs she will ensure the message  gets to the proper channels. In order to measure annual yearly progress for ELLs, we are now taking into account how ELLs  perform on their MOSL. Data extrapolated from these assessments is shared with the ENL teachers.   An area of need  identified for ELLs is in the area of inferring when reading text. School leadership is very involved with our ELL population and  they value the input of the ENL teachers to ensure that the needs are ELLs are being met when making school wide decisions.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    This year PS/IS 48 has taken a proactive approach in team building. Many changes were made to our SIT and Child Study  teams. For example, teams now meet on a bi-weekly basis and provisions were made so that more teachers could be involved  in the process of reviewing summative data. Administration has also made it a point to be at every meeting in order to ensure  that suggestions for RTI were implemented as efficiently as possible. Some examples of RTI being utilized are Fundations and  Orton Gillingham. RTI protocol is reviewed with teachers. The SIT team as well as child study discusses each child on a case by  case basis and comes up with a specific plan. Records and data are kept and each child and every 6 weeks results are reviewed  to see if progress was made.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school utilizes Fountas and Pinnell along with other assessments and checklists to identify students in need of RTI.  In  addition, the universal screening process for ELLs (NYSITELL) is also closely examined. Based on need, the school implements  the Wilson program for the lower grades, which continually charts student progress to guide instruction and Soar to Success  and Visualizing and Verbalizing for the upper grades. The progress of these students is checked by Quick Checks and DRA  assessments.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns of NYSITELL and NYSESLAT indicate that student progress correlates to years of service in ENL. NYSESLAT data  patterns indicate that students are struggling in the area of writing. NYSITELL data patterns reveal that incoming students  struggle in the area of word production.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         We now have 3 ENL teachers at PS/IS 48. These teachers now meet as a department on a weekly basis to discuss these findings  and further design instruction based on assessments.  The data is also shared with administration so that they may support the  ENL program. The ENL coordinator as well as the an additional ENL teacher now serve on many of the teams that have been  put in place at our school. This ensures that our ELLs have a voice and that there is a cohesive decision making process when  considering programs to meet the needs of our population. Some of the teams are as follows: school leadership,  Mosl committee, Child study, SIT, as well as impact teams. This is a strong atestment to the administrations commitment to  our ELL population.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In order for students to receive their mandated hours and effectively schedule these services, ELL students are  grouped with heterogeneous proficiency levels. In the Free Standing ENL model a combination of push in and pull out  sessions are utilized. The minutes that the students receive of both push in and pull out are based on the student's  scores. In order to fulfill the new prescribed minutes, an additional certified ENL teacher has been procured part-time  for the 2018-2019 school year. In addition, we recognize that students who have tested out in the past 2 years will be  receiving 90 minutes of teacher-led support. Differentiated instruction is provided within the groups in order to  address the academic needs of all students.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     PS/ IS 48 does not have a TBE program at this time.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      PS/IS 48 does not have a dual language program at this time.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    When creating the schedule for the academic year, the administration sits down with the ENL teachers to review NYSESLAT  results in order to calculate the amount of mandated minutes of explicit ENL instruction required for each student. Based on  previous NYSITELL results, a block of time is also allotted for the potential incoming kindergarten/newly enrolled students.  Blocks of time are also dedicated for common planning between teachers on the grade and the ENL teachers. We are aware  that according to the new CR Part 154 the new proficiency levels require different total number of minutes and delivery type.  In order to comply with these new mandates NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores are carefully reviewed for each student to ensure  proper scheduling.               3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     Content area instruction is covered during the ELL student's time in their regular classrooms. Classroom teachers collaborate  with the ELL teachers in order to present Common Core Learning concepts using scaffolding techniques such as TPR  methodology and Sheltered English, so as to further facilitate ELL language development.  The pacing calendar and content   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      remains the same for all students. Although we do not have any TBE or Dual Language programs, we are currently examining  native language support technology program to be used in the classroom to support content area (Duolingo.com and  Imagine learning.com) All classroom content is delivered in English.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Currently PS/IS 48 does not have a TBE or Dual Language program, therefore, the students are not receiving periodic  assessments in their native language. In the case of special education evaluations, we are cognizant that all ELLs referred for an  evaluation must receive the evaluation in both their native language and English.    Although we do not currently have a  bilingual program at our school, the ENL teachers work very closely with the test coordianator to monitor any possible  students that would require a  translated version of a state test.  In the instances of low incidence languages we have used  funding to secure translators from the "Big Word" a  Doe approved vendor in order to assist the child.We understand that a  child should be given every opportunity     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE - In the event of receiving SIFE students, intervention plans will be created based on the results of the oral interview  and the Literacy Evaluation for Newcomers (LENS).   b. Newcomer - Newcomer intervention heavily focused on acquisition of Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS).   c. Developing - ELL students receiving service for 4 or more years are given an extension of services for standardized tests. For  those students, the academic interventions focus more on text complexity. Extensive preparation in the writing workshop is  also done in the ENL setting.    d. Long Term - In the case of long term ELLs, the school intervention team would meet to review student's work to see if there  was an academic issue impeding the student's language acquisition and then plan further instruction.  e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status - Former ELLs will receive 90minutes of integrated ENL for 2 years after  testing out.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    ELL-SWDs are provided with Wilson instruction, small group units that are aligned with the Common Core Standards  (Language Skills Teaching Center - Lakeshore, Imagine Learning). In addition, the ENL teachers share best practices of TESOL  methodology with all teachers of ELLs on staff.   Teachers working with this population of ELLs are trained in Orton Gillinham.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  PS/IS 48 recognized the need for SWDs to be serviced in the least restrictive environment. We now have an ICT class on all  grades. We utilize the special education teacher's expertise and knowledge to help address those targeted students along with  our speech and occupational therapist. In the case of ELLs with SWDs, the ENL teachers are also on hand to support the needs  of the ELL students. Administration allows for scheduling to be flexible for these providers in order for them to have common  planning time to collaborate. The school's criteria for ICT placement is based on the psychological report, the social  observation and the IEP recommendation.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention programs for ELL-SWDs include AIS, Wilson, and we have now created ICT classes on every grade. Programs such  as AIS and Wilson are also available to any struggling ELLs without IEPs. Exam histories from ATS are used to extrapolate data.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     In light of the changes to the NYSESLAT we are considering purchasing new preparation books "Getting Ready for the  NYSESLAT" (Published by Attanasio & Associates). In addition, a new technology program for ELLs is also being considered:  "Fast Forward Reading Assistant" by Scientific Learning as well as Achieve 3000.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   PS/IS 48 has never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   At PS/IS 48, every child is afforded the same opportunity to participate in all the activities that the school has to offer.  Students are invited to participate in not only academic intervention programs, but a rich art program as well (Guggenheim  Museum, Ballroom dancing, Arts connection.) ELL families are made aware of these events via letters sent home in their  preferred language. This past year and after school intervention program was offered to ELLs in grades K-2 and a Saturday  writing academy was offered to ELLs grades 3-8.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In light of the Common Core Standards, the school has purchased Finish Line For ELLS-Continental Press in order to target the  four modalities while addressing content area academic language and provide explicit instruction to ELLs in these domains. In  addition, Imagine Learning software is used to provide further differentiated instruction.The school has also purchased, for  grades 3-5, Language Power-Teacher Created Materials in order to provide ELLs with more support in text complexity. For  native language support, bilingual glossaries and literature is made available to students in the classroom.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As we do not have any TBE or Dual language programs at this time therefore explicit native language instruction does not take  place. However, whenever possible native language support is provided in the form of bilingual dictionaries, bilingual  glossaries are also made available to the students.  Bilingual copies of state tests are also provided if needed. In the event that  the  state does not have a version of th test in the students language the school makes every effort to provide a certified  translator. PS/IS 48 recognizes the value of a students native language and makes every effort to make the student feel  empowered and encourages families to preserve their native language and not allow attrition to take place        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    If an ELL is in need of support services, first the case is looked at by the school's Academic Intervention Team where a plan is  put together for that student. Each plan is tailored to meet the need of each individual student. If the child has an IEP, the IEP  is looked at closely to determine what services are needed and how they should be appropriately delivered. Therefore, all  services at the school (SETTS, OT, PT, Speech, etc.) correspond to ELLs' grade levels, ages, and if needed, functioning levels.  As  the ENL teachers form part of the both the SIT and Child Study team, time is allotted on a weekly basis to discuss ELL issues as  well as to update members on CRPart 154.2 changes.This allows for administration to be appraised at to what is needed and  what changes are to be made.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    In light of the Common Core Standards, the school has purchased Finish Line For ELLS-Continental Press in order to target the  four modalities while addressing content area academic language and provide explicit instruction to ELLs in these domains. In  addition, Imagine Learning software is used to provide further differentiated instruction.The school has also purchased, for  grades 3-5, Language Power-Teacher Created Materials in order to provide ELLs with more support in text complexity. For  native language support, bilingual glossaries and literature is made available to students in the classroom.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In order to assist newly enrolled ELLs transition into our school a team effort is required. After ENL teachers identify the  student this information is quickly shared with not only administration but with teachers, the parent coordinator as well as the  school based support team. The ENL teachers are the liaisons for these students. The guidance counselor is also appraised fo  these students. Ms. Reese our schools guidance counselor oversees a program in which ELL students (newcomers) can team up  with other ELL students who speak their native language, making the transition easier for the student in their new school and  environment. Students learn their new language (English) using technology and computer programs to help introduce them to  their new language using the four modalities.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    In PS/IS 48's middle school, Spanish is offered.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   At this time Ps/IS 48 does not have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In order for  our school to meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2, PS/IS 48 offers professional  development opportunities.  The purpose of these opportunities is to enhance and support ELL instruction.  Professional  development is offered to all staff (assistant principal, common branch teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, ENL  teachers, special education teachers, the parent coordinator, the speech therapist, school psychologist and secretaries) during  our mandated professional development days, grade meetings and faculty meetings.  Professional development is driven by  the needs of the students and teachers. Workshops are on a continuum basis. A sign in sheet will be implemented this year for  recording. Some of the workshops include the following: (tentative calendar provided below) An agenda and sign in sheet is  maintained in the main office and in teacher's file.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teachers in conjunction with the support staff (i.e guidance counselor) meet with classroom teachers in transitioning  grades (i.e. 5th and 8  th  ) to brainstorm the best tactics to help ELLs transition to new learning environments both  academically and emotionally. In addition, the ENL teachers have complied a lending library which teachers can access at  anytime for reference. It contains a wealth of information on best practices and ELL sub-groups.   In order to meet the  requirements for CR Part 154.2 for training time is allotted for the ENL teachers to turn key what they have learned at their  trainings as well as to provide best practices . Administration allows for common planning periods, inter visitations and  Monday PD time for these trainings to take place. Agendas and sign in sheets are stored in the ENL teachers' office.  Refer to question 1          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Although it has always been important to maintain strong communication between ELL families and teachers, we are most  fortunate to be working in a time when we have a chancellor that recognizes the importance of this as well. As always,  whenever needed, phone conferences can be conducted but now we have been provided with time on a weekly basis which is  utilized for such parent outreach. The LAC Coordinators are always apprised of these meetings beforehand so that they may  make ample provisions for interpretation and translation services. These services can be in the form of translations of  documents or interpretation services at any school interaction per parent request. ELL parents are also invited annually to a  luncheon to express any questions or concerns they might have about their child and their input on how we can make the  school more accessible to immigrant families.  In addition to the mandated parent teacher conferences one on one parent  meetings are on going to meet the new CR part 154 requirements. Parent outreach is done through physical meetings during  Tuesday afternoons or on an ongoing basis through phone conferences.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   PS/IS 48 considers themselves a family. The PTA is very active in working with both parents and the administration. They are  very aware of the special needs/concerns that ELL families often have. Therefore, our Parent Coordinator, in conjunction with  the ENL teachers and their outreach team make every effort to incorporate these families in all activities. The Parent  Coordinator is also the Co-LAC coordinator with Ms. Vitale. Any workshops that she provides to parents are sent home to ELL  families in their preferred language. There is also an open door policy on behalf of the principal. All parents are made to feel  very comfortable to approach her with any questions or concerns they have. She is a strong advocate for ELL families and  procures to make sure the needs of this population are met.  Some examples of activities that have been incorporated for our  ELL families are : Saturday morning movie and breakfast with their child. We also hosted learning sessions on how parents can  help their child at home. A computer training session was also offered to assist ELL parents in navigating RAZ -Kids a program  which is being utilized by our ELL students. This year the ENL teachers have also created a monthly news letter to keep ELL  parents up on what is going on at school. Ms. Guthrie has been involved with all of these activities.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Ms. Christine Vitale is a New York State certified teacher.  She holds master’s degrees in TESOL, Special Education, and  Administration and Supervision as well as a bilingual Spanish extension.  PS/IS 48 recognizes the importance of the new changes  that have been implemented to CR-154. As a direct result, we have hired a second ENL teacher to fulfill the new requirements. Ms.  Teresa Ciaramella is also a fully certified teacher of New York State with a degree in Childhood Education and a master's degree in  TESOL. Both are committed to academic rigor for their ELL students.     All students received rich academic language instruction to increase listening and speaking standards as well as reading and writing  standards. PS/IS 48 follows a Comprehensive Literacy Model that supports English Language Learners.  Inherent in our K-5 Comprehensive Instruction Model are student-centered authentic conversations.  Students receive explicit  instruction in the use of conversational prompts designed to engage them in meaningful, focused discussions of quality  literature.  It is through these conversations that students help one another, not only to develop richer vocabulary but also learn to  deepen their comprehension of the text and further build each child's schemata.  These conservations are an integral aspect of the  instructional model – reader’s and writer’s workshops, read aloud, small group instruction and partnerships.  Indeed, instruction in  all content areas are organized in such a way that students are required to interact with each other utilizing collaborative learning  techniques while simultaneously honing both receptive and expressive language.                              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Allison O'Donnell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/IS 48                                                                              School DBN: 31R048  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      PTA, School Leadership Team meeting and monthly parent workshops are used to assess written translation and  oral interpretation needs. The ENL teachers and the Parent Coordinator meet with ELL parents on an ongoing  basis. This information is used to ensure parents are provided with information in their native language. The DOE  interpretation telephone unit is used for parent teacher conferences and translation monies are used to translate  notices/ letters into many different languages. Translation services are provided at monthly PTA meeting. Posters  and notices are posted in different languages throughout the school. In order to ensure that all parents requests  are honored, information is harvested from HLIS surveys, blue contact cards and RAPL and RCPL reports in ATS.  The ENL teachers in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator then compile all this information to determine  translation needs.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65       2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency protocol will be followed to call home with information on blue cards. In the event  that oral translation is needed all faculty has been trained on how to utilize the language line for over the phone  interpretation.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      During a staff conference Ms. Guthrie and Ms.Vitale will review chancellors regulation A-663 with all faculty and will  share available resources with the staff. The resources will be housed in Ms. Vitale's office          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      As per Chancellors Regulations, at registration every family is asked for their written and oral language preference.  This information is documented on the students emergency blue card, as well as in ATS. If there is a need for language  interpretation the school makes every effort to obtain the requested language using all the channels previously  stated. The ENL teachers and the Parent Coordinator work in tandem with the school's pupil personnel secretary to  monitor the schools translation and interpretation needs through ATS reports and blue card findings. We are  cognizant that schools must determine a family's need for this service within 30 days of enrollment. We are also  aware that families have a right to notification of any critical information regarding their child's education including  health, safety, legal disciplinary matters and entitlement to placement in any Special Education, ELL, or non-standard  academic program. In addition, both the ENL teachers and the Parent Coordinator will be sent the periodic trainings  provided by the DOE translation and interpretations unit. We will provide each parent whose primary language that is  other than English with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation in the appropriate  covered languages and instructions on how to obtain such services. At the main entrance, a sign in each covered  language indicating the office/room where a copy of such written notification can be obtained. In addition, a  Language ID card is placed at the security desk and in the main office. Parents will be notified of the DOE website  concerning the rights of parents to translation and interpretation and how to access such services.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69     Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school is currently in the process of creating a survey which canvases parental satisfaction that has been provided  to them in terms of translation and interpretation services. This survey will be disseminated in the languages that  have been pre-identified in past findings. The LAC Coordinators will be reviewing the data that the surveys yield and  making adjustments to our policies accordingly.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70
