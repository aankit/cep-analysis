This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?    We offer high quality, standards based instruction in a diverse and inclusive, barrier-free environment.    We develop student passions and interests through rigorous instruction so that our students become   inquisitive, lifelong learners     We foster a community of dedicated and expertly trained staff members who strive to help each child meet   and exceed their expectations in literacy, mathematics, science, technology and the arts.     We promote critical and analytical thinking that encourages individual and collaborative problem solving.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9           We set clear expectations based upon a rigorous academic curriculum, which allow students to create   authentic work, which meets and exceeds the standards.      We honor and model hard work, cooperation, effort, kindness, honesty, responsibility, tolerance and integrity   of character, all of which create a vibrant atmosphere for children to grow, flourish and appreciate one  another.   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Clear expectations are based upon the Common Core Learning Standards. We honor and model hard work,  cooperation, effort, kindness, honesty, responsibility, tolerance and integrity of character, all of which create a vibrant  atmosphere in which children grow, flourish, and appreciate each other.    Through grant-writing and PTA fundraising, we have formed important collaborations to help us augment the work of  our art and music teachers. We believe in well-rounded experiences for our students that provide other opportunities  to celebrate their learning styles and interests. The collaborations currently in place are provided through the  Metropolitan Opera House and the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. In addition, we have collaborations with  the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and National Dance Institute. A collaboration with St. John's Senior Home has  been established to provide seniors with entertainment that showcases the many talents and supports our students  can offer.       We have a particular concern for our children with Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs) and for our English  Language Learners (ELL). As the demographics of our neighborhood have changed, these groups fluctuate in terms of  numbers.    In the last ten years, we have experienced approximately a 50% increase in the student population of the school. That  growth has led to exciting new challenges, the addition of valued staff members, and an incentive to rethink and  regroup as necessary. At the behest of the DOE, we are administratively responsible for a pre-K site in another  building. Currently, there is a register of over 400 four-year-olds this school year, bringing forth a new set of exciting  challenges.      We are fortunate to have received funds from the PTA for personnel responsible for Academic Intervention Services  (AIS). AIS services are to be provided regularly in small groups in order to meet the needs of all of our student  population. Staff to student ratios have been ameliorated due to these services being provided, which otherwise  would not have been possible.                3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The English language learners, and special needs students in our population continue to be subgroups in which we are  invested, and for whom we are concerned. This year’s schedule will, once again, include multiple periods every week,  in every grade, for common prep periods. We see these periods of collaboration as opportunities for inquiry into  interventions, as well as ways to include meeting the needs of these students in our daily teaching.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Inquiry teams will be developed and led by our newly assigned literacy and math coaches. Data will be collected and  used to inform instruction with a particular focus on our target groups.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We are committed to helping students make progress as established by our schedule common prep periods every  week on every grade. The collaborative conversations our teachers engaged in have focused on achieving more  rigorous instruction for ELA and Math instruction. Pedagogy has changed, and our students have demonstrated  growth school wide.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K010   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   933   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  PS 10 is a learning community that is safe, nurturing, and supportive for the entire school community. School leaders  convey high expectations to staff through the Danielson Framework for Teaching and professional learning sessions  facilitated by internal staff and off-site training. Family engagement sessions help parents understand their children’s  progress in school and communicate expectations connected to college and career readiness.    Teachers have protocols in place to look at student work and student assessment data both to drive instruction and to  meet student needs. PD will also be based on teacher needs to improve pedagogy, quality teacher development, and  leadership development.   The school community has adopted systems, activities and programs that support student social and emotional  development that remove barriers to learning to foster academic success. The school community has benefited from  the strategic decisions around students and staff’s social and emotional health by creating an environment that is  safe, orderly, and conducive to learning. The school will continue to foster social and emotional development through  the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports as well as mentor buddies. In reviewing the OORS data, it has been  identified that the majority of incidents occur in the cafeteria and playground. Additionally, the 2016-2017 School  survey reflects that PS10 received an 80% in Classroom Behavior and 86% in Social Emotional indicators.    Based on the NYC School Survey, 97% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to use their students'  prior knowledge to make their lessons relevant to their everyday life, teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are  able to modify instructional activities and materials to meet the development needs and learning interests of all their  students, teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to develop appropriate Individual Education Programs  for their students with disabilities, and teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they are able to adapt instruction to  ensure it represents all cultures/backgrounds positively.       Based on the NYC School Survey for Peer Collaboration, a priority need is coordinating teaching with instruction at  other grade levels with a specific focus on writing and use of rubrics.       All stakeholders’ voices are heard and believe that they play a vital role in the journey towards educational excellence.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

They will also determine how to use the results of assessments to group and assign AIS to  students based on need.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Public School 10 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Public School 10 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Public School 10, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

An approach that focuses on literacy supported with  field trip experiences and project based learning will be utilized to deliver targeted instruction  that addresses the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The rationale for  implementing this program is to provide instruction in English Language Arts  and other  disciplines while enhancing language acquisition and building background knowledge.  Students  will engage in projects that will increase content and academic vocabulary, while promoting  language development.  Students will also use  Words Their Way, a developmental word study  program .  Imagine Learning will also be utilized to help differentiate instruction and target  student specific needs such as developing English fluency and increasing ELLs' vocabulary  knowledge.   These materials are supplemental and will only be used in the after-school program  and Saturday Academy.  Already acquired technology such as iPads and laptops will also be  used in the program to enhance inquiry and research within units of study.   Instruction will  mainly be conducted in English.  Home language supports will be provided through use of native  language books, dictionaries and technology .      Students in grades kindergarten to five at the Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning levels of  English proficiency will be invited participate in the program. Some Expanding and  Commanding students will also be invited.   NYSESLAT  results and Teachers College  evaluations are used to identify  students who have a need for extensive word work or who  demonstrate deficiencies in phonemic awareness.  Newcomer ELLs and ELLs with learning  disabilities are focus groups for the program.   Some students with learning disabilities also  struggle with phonemic awareness and could also benefit from this program.  We've had success  in the past with Words Their Way and would like to continue using its consumable student  books.  Students will meet once  a week on Wednesdays for grades kindergarten through one  with a teacher who has bilingual  certification and for grades two to three  with an ENL certified  teacher. Grade four and five students will gather on Thursdays with an ENL certified  teacher.  All groups will meet for one hour from 3:00-4:00 p.m. in groups of ten.    The program  will run for 25 weeks from October 17 through April 25.  The Saturday Academy will meet  seven Saturdays from February 9, 2019 through March 23, 2019 and from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.  An ENL certified teacher will meet with a group of ten students from grades one and  two.  Another ENL certified teacher will meet with a group of ten students from grades three to  five.  We will be taking trips during Saturday Academy to the New York Aquarium and to  neighboring stores to support our thematic projects. Parents will be invited on trips and  to attend  student presentations where they will showcase and explain their projects.  Attendance will be  taken for both programs and kept in the main office. Parent notifications will be sent in their  preferred languages.    P.S.10 will replenish student level books of Words Their Way in Action, which builds students'  vocabulary, spelling and word recognition through hands on learning experiences.

Materials can be used in individual, small group or whole group  instruction. Firstly, students will participate in spelling inventories and assessments that will  determine their levels, and secondly, they will be grouped for instruction.   Lastly, students  will  engage in word sorts.  Additionally, Words Their Way will be implemented as a word study  component embedded in content or thematic lessons that will correlate to science and social  studies scope and sequence; therefore, students will be engaged in reading activities.  We will  also acquire sets of English Explorers theme books by Benchmark to support our studies.   These  thematic books are language leveled and enable content instruction in science and social  studies.  In addition, we will acquire ten Imagine Learning licenses.  This computer program will  empower our ELLs and help build their English proficiency by individually tailoring  instructional activities that meet their needs.  Imagine Learning can also be accessed at home  for  further support and practice. It also provides directions and explanations in student's native  language. Our target group for this program is Newcomer ELLs in the Entering and Emerging  levels along with some Transitioning students.    Based on ATS records of families' indicated home language preferences, families will receive  written notification in their preferred languages.     Records, including student attendance,  will be maintained by the school's ELL coordinator.    Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             This year our ENL After School Program and Saturday Academy will have a project based  learning component with the intent of providing an educational and engaging experience for our  ELLs.  The rationale for the program's professional development is to enhance our understanding  of best practices on incorporating project based learning in content and language  instruction.  This will benefit our program delivery and student outcomes by augmenting  student's learning through interdisciplinary lessons that have multiple entry points.   ENL  teachers, Ms. Luciano and Ms. Khuu would like to attend a full day conference on October 27,  2018 that focuses on this subject and it is "2018 Language Series: Multiple Pathways to Learning  in the Age of Accountability", provided by Bank Street School of Education which will focus on  student engagement in both language and content development through multiple pathways:  music, project based learning, multimodal literacy among others. The keynote presentation will  be given by Dr. Nancy Cloud, an expert in ENL teaching.  The schedule will include workshops  such as: Music Moves the Room: Using songs, rhythm, and music games to enhance language  development and bring joy to the day; Let's Play! Using Games to Support Language  Development Across the Grades; Promoting a Community of Writers: Never Enough Writing  Supports in the Language Aware Classroom!; The “I” and the “Us”: Exploring Multi-Modalities  and Building Community Through Language Learning; and, Working with Very Young Dual  Language Learners in Project Time. ENL teachers will attend the conference and then  share information and further explore our focal topic with classroom teachers  and paraprofessionals through our study groups during Monday PD 60 minute sessions.

The schedule is as  follows:  Cycle one-November 5, 19, 26, and December 3, 2018, Cycle two-January 28,  February 4, 11, 25, 2019, and Cycle three-April 29, May 6, 13, and 20, 2019.  Each cycle will  have its own focus.  Cycle one will be on integrating project based learning for ELL  instruction.  Cycle two will be on strategies for advancing ELL literacy.  Cycle three will be on  multiple entry points for ELLs.  ENL teachers will lead discussions and explore these topics of  study with teachers and paraprofessionals.  The conference fee for both ENL teachers will be covered by Title III funds only (budget section  below); and the two teachers' fees will be provided using Title III funds. ENL teachers will not  recieve per-session for attending the conference.  In addition, study groups and Monday PD  sessions are at no cost to Title III. Resources and information from this Professional  Development series will be turnkeyed to classroom teachers who have ELL students in their  classes through a Google Drive folder as well as in a binder with hard copies containing this  information. Teachers will track student progress made directly as a result of using strategies  learned and implemented by teachers through maintaining running records, reading and writing  assessments, and through their conferring notes.   Through the usage of Google Sheets, agendas and attendance will also be shared via Google  Drive.         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

All classroom and cluster teachers provide a monthly communication to families via  online newsletter, or paper-based newsletter outlining unit topics, projects, homework, and other  instructional strategies to partner with families at home. These newsletters are translated in every  language represented in our school. We also offer adult ENL classes to parents to support their  literacy development. Parents are invited to participate in a wide realm of committee including  the diversity committee, hosted by our school leadership team, PTA parents and ENL teachers  during the month of November which celebrates the diverse population represented in or school  community. The rationale in implementing these parental engagement activities is to promote  parental involvement in their child's language acquisition and literacy development processes. In  addition, the school hosts a potluck dinner at the end of the month to highlight multiculturalism  within our school community where all staff, students, and their families are invited to  attend. Activities will be centered around what can parents do to help increase language and  literacy development at home.  Workshops are provided by ENL teacher, after school classroom  teacher and Parent Coordinator throughout the year on the following topics; Reading  Strategies,  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT,  and implementing online resources to support  literacy at home.  Parents will also be invited to a workshop by ENL teachers and classroom  after-school teachers on activities they can do at home to assist their child with their literacy  development. Meetings will take place on Wednesday or Thursday from 3:00 to 4:00   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    throughout the months of November 2018 through March 2019 .  Parents are notified of these  meetings and activities by parent letters in backpacks, e-mails, P.S. 10's website and by the  school calendar in both English and parents' preferred languages.  Translation services are  provided by other staff members as needed.     Records, including agendas, invitations, and sign-in sheets, will be maintained by the ELL  Coordinator.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At P.S.10, we use various formative assessments to assess the literacy development for ELLs:    •                NYSESLAT  •     Fountas and Pinnell  •     Teacher's College Reading Writing Project (TCRWP)  •                Fundations   •                On Demand Writing Pieces  •                Words Their Way  All ELLs are administered the NYSESLAT and results are analyzed  as a guide for instructional planning. Students' strengths and  areas of need are identified and supportive measures are planned and implemented.  Children are also assessed with TCRWP a  minimum of three times a year. An initial assessment is given in September, a mid-year assessment in January, and an end-of-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      year in June. Fundations assessments are administered three times a year for grades kindergarten and grade one.  On Demand  Writing Pieces are developed by students four to five times a year.  These are centered on a unit of study from our Standards  based curriculum.  Words Their Way spelling inventories are given to all ELLs and former ELLs to assess students' orthographic  developmental stages. Classroom teachers and ENL teachers monitor for results by tracking student progress from these  assessments and include this data on tracking sheets. Student progress is discussed on a weekly basis at grade-level meetings,  where research-based recommendations and targeted strategies are provided so that instruction is modified to support  ELLs.   Through this the school is learning which strategies and techniques have been most effective in supporting student  progress.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers collaboratively analyze student data from these assessments in order to plan for instruction. Small groups are  developed based on students' TC levels, and when necessary students are regrouped based on these results.  We  have the  Pupil Personnel Committee (PPC) which meets once a month in order to discuss and address concerns on students'  progress.  NYSESLAT results are a key component of student discussions on the PPC meetings, where test results are  specifically analyzed for individual students.  Our Literacy Coach works with all teachers to ensure that instruction is being  tailored to meet student needs.  Furthermore, she provides researched based methods and strategies that promote learning.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  At P.S.10, we use Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) assessments at the beginning and at the end of the year to  identify progress and areas of need for our ELLs. For our newcomer ELLs that arrive after the baseline assessment is  administered, we analyze NYSITELL data to determine this information. In addition, NYSESLAT results are also used to show the  number of students who have demonstrated progress and proficiency in English language acquisition as well as data from  Fountas and Pinnell and Teachers College reading assessments.   We also use this data to  evaluate the effectiveness of our  ENL program.  The NYSESLAT 2016 data shows that our ELLs are making gains by moving to the next proficiency level or by  increasing their numbers on the scale scores.   For instance, several of our ELLs moved from the Entering level to Expanding  and others moved from Intermediate to Expanding.  We had Commanding level students in grades kindergarten,  three, four,  and five. Our Entering and Emerging students are newcomers or students with learning disabilities including NYSAA  students.  Additionally, it should be noted that our ELLs meet promotional criteria as per their IEPs.  With support provided by  the ENL program, ELL students have demonstrated that they are better equipped to meet the Common Core State  Standards.  .     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The structures which we have in place at P.S.10 to address interventions once summative data has been gathered for our ELLs  include home language support (such as translated materials), modified vocabulary instruction, cooperative learning, and  differentiated classroom assessments. Furthermore, there are two ENL intervention  after school programs, one is an  academic program and the other a social-emotional program that serves ELL students who have been identified in this area of  need.  Our ELLs also receive academic support during a morning program where students are in small groups.  Lastly, we have  a Saturday program where thematic based instruction and field trips that support the units of study are held.  One of our goals  is to increase background knowledge for our ELLs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S.10 reviews and analyzes data to drive instruction for our ELLs.  Using the three Tiers of RTI our ELLs are  given appropriate  and effective interventions to provide the education these students need.  Tier I  Classroom teachers scaffold lessons, give  clear instructions and explanations so as to enable all students, especially our ELLs, to develop literacy skills and meet grade  level benchmarks.  When our ELLs are below benchmark on any particular skills the students receive instructional support  within the classroom. Tier II provides intensive intervention.  The intervention is given in the classroom or out of the classroom  with an AIS staff member who will target specific skills the students need to acquire. In Tier III our ELLs receive rigorous  individualized intervention to target their language and content-area learning needs, using research-based  strategies.  ***  PPC   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The majority of our ELLs are making gains in the various modalities which will enable them to reach expanding and or  commanding levels on the NYSESLAT.  We annually review the NYSESLAT results, as shown on RLAT, to aid in our evaluation of  ELLs and an analysis of 2017 NYSESLAT performance levels shows that most ELLs are at the Expanding level.  This is followed by  a moderate number of ELLs at the Commanding level.   Grade five has a greater concentration of students who scored at the  Transitioning level on 2016 NYSESLAT to the Expanding level on 2017 NYSESLAT.  Grade five also has the most number of  students who scored at the Expanding level on 2016 NYSESLAT to Commanding on 2017 NYSESLAT.  Grades three and  four have a moderate number of students at the Expanding level.  Grade two has a moderate level of students at the  Transitioning level and grade one has students distributed almost evenly throughout levels.  Some of our newcomer ELLs on  grade two made significant gains going from Emerging level on 2016 NYSESLAT to Transitioning on 2017 NYSESLAT.   The fall  entry 2017 NYSITELL results reveal that kindergarten has the mostly Transitioning and Expanding students and few Entering  and Emerging students.   In addition, we plan our ENL instruction to support student strengths and bolster weak areas, as  determined by the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL.          7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to share information revealed by data, we have grade meetings between classroom teachers and ENL teachers.  We  also have cross-grade conferences where we can articulate data findings.  In addition, we have the Pupil Personnel Committee  that meets twice a month to further share student information.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students in our Freestanding ENL program are heterogeneously grouped and are serviced via the standalone and  integrated models. The ENL teachers group students in the entering and emerging levels in two grades to provide  standalone minutes.   Integrated minutes for entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding are  served by the ENL teachers during ELA and content blocks.  Classroom teachers of ELL students and ENL teacher meet  during common times to collaborate and plan instruction.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our ENL program observes the following mandates as per Commissioner's Regulations Part 154 : Entering and  Emerging  360 minutes per week, Transitioning and Expanding:  180 minutes per week and for Commanding  90 minutes per  week. ELL students are grouped according to their grade levels and their current levels of English acquisition by the following  units: Students at the entering level receive one standalone ENL and one integrated unit. Students at the emerging level   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      receive one standalone ENL and one integrated unit. Students at the transitioning level receive  .5 standalone ENL and .5  integrated units, expanding one integrated unit, commanding .5 integrated unit.  In order to meet the linguistic need of our  ELLs, parent choice, and CR Part 154 mandates, language instruction is aligned to ELA and content area standards.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        P. S. 10  implements a standards-driven comprehensive program for our English Language Learners (ELLs). Content area  instruction is aligned with the Common Core Standards in Math, Science, Social Studies, and Technology.  Instruction is in  English and students are taught with an emphasis on vocabulary of the content being taught.   Investigative Method is  implemented in content and students draw conclusions in hands-on group activities that are kinesthetic and  collaborative.  This approach naturally supports ELLs and diverse learners.  Visual aids are also used  to scaffold content  vocabulary as well; moreover, students are allowed to use native language dictionaries to aid their comprehension.  Students  are also paired with native language speakers to help support them.    Our Targeted Intervention program consists of:  •     All ELL students, who receive additional support in morning and/or afterschool programs  •     AIS small group instruction, as well as scaffolding of instruction in literacy and math  •     In the ENL program and throughout the school students are also exposed to a print-rich environment and materials to  support learning.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Spanish ELLs are given the Spanish LAB to evaluate their native language ability. We also have books in various languages as  well as staff who speak diffenent languages to help assess students' native language ability and help evaluate student progress  throughout the year. ELLs also take the State tests (besides ELA) in their native language if it is available; in addition, all state  required ELA modifications for standardized tests are provided to ELLs.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Differentiation of Instruction  a)     Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are provided with an after school  program to strengthen their  academic skills in content areas. In addition, they attend a Saturday Academy for about seven weeks where instruction is  theme based and enhanced with related trips that contextualize our teaching.  These students are also invitied to morning  programs.  Small group instruction  is provided to our SIFE students to boost literacy and emphasis is given to beginning  reading skills.  Fundations is a big part of this effort.  In addition, Words Their Way is utilized to help boost phonemic  awareness.  b)     We provide a strong language acquisition program to our newcomer students and to those in the Entering and Emerging  Levels (as per the NYSESLAT):             •  LEAP Frog – Language First Program and Sounds in Motion--a phonemic-awareness program             •-Readalouds and picture word walls support their language development             • The Balanced Literacy program is scaffolded throughout the program to target and support our ELL students.             • We've also acquired Imagine Learning which is an interactive computer based program and tailored to students'  specific needs.  This program evalutates students reading and English language ability. It then proceeds to provide highly  engaging student driven activities that promote reading skills and language learning.               • Words Their Way is also used with our Newcomer ELLs.  c)     Students participate in an instructional program that regularly ensures continuity of rigorous instruction for ELLS receiving  services for 4-6 years.  Reading instruction is supported through guided reading groups where reading comprehension   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      strategies are practiced.    d)     For long-term ELLs - special groupings are formed, and individualized tutoring plans are made using the reading and  writing workshop model.  These students also participate in guided reading instruction.  e)      Former ELLs up to two years receive small group instruction according to reading level and scaffolds are provided to  support their language development.    Literature circles are also part of their guided reading groups.  Collaboration with  classroom teachers is a main component of support for former ELLs.  The ENL teacher meets with classroom teacher to  enhance lessons, provide scaffolds and vocabulary support.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     Students are surrounded by a print-rich environment, tradebooks, classroom libraries, school library and instructional  materials that   are aligned with the NYC Core Curriculum and reflect the language of instruction   •     Students also participate in small group, task-oriented projects and situations that guide the production of language both  in verbal and written form.  •     Students are supported with Guided Reading strategies, Fundations,  vocabulary/word study and Leap Frog programs in  reading-specific language prompts to help the ELL student develop academic language in reading and writing.    Smartboards, IPADs, and laptops are utilized in the classrooms to help support all students.  By use of technology and grade  and age appropriate materials ELLs language acquisition is enhanced for they provide visuals and interactive opportunities for  learning.  Scaffolds and modified instruction is readily accessible through them.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   For our ELLs with special needs their Individual Education Plan (IEP) is followed. Lessons are scaffolded and hands-on activities   support their learning. Our ELLs-SWDs are mainstreamed into General Education classes for a least restrictive enviornment.  Integrated Co-Teaching classes are in place as an inclusion model for ELL-SWDs.  ELLs who have IEPs are placed in ICT classes  where they will receive instruction with non-disabled peers.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention for ELLs is provided in Morning School and After School programs, and daily pull-out small group  programs to help students reach state standards.  Focus is on building ELL vocabulary skills, comprehension skills, math,  science and social studies.  ENL strategies, scaffolding instruction in all areas, language acquisition and native language support  are used for general education, students with special needs, long term ELLs and those reaching commanding level.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data trends evidenced by 2017 NYSESLAT results, we will be continuing with the Imagine Learning program which we  just recently added  to our ENL instruction.   This new program will empower our ELLs by building their English proficieny with  differentiated instruction in the four language domains.  The program has a home component to support language  development at home and native language support as well.  Our target group for this program will be our newcomer ELLs in  the Entering and Emerging levels.  Since we have a great majority of students at the Expanding and Commanding levels,  we  will also continue with Words Their Way which is a developmental language program.   In addition, we will acquire guided  reading books at levels greater than q, in order to continue building vocabulary and comprehension in more difficult texts.  We  also have a few newcomer upper grade students and we will acquire native language books to help support their English  language development.  We will also implement a Saturday Academy that will focus on building background knowledge.  We  will look at Social Studies scope and sequence to plan trips and areas of study that will support our newcomer ELLs.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A:        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All schools programs and services are offered to our entire school population -ESL, Special Education, G&T and General  Education.  ELLs are invited to participate in school programs by receiving letters in their home communications  folder.  Therefore, our ELLs participate in morning and afterschool programs for additional academic support.  Students have  this opportunity to enhance their speaking, listening, reading and writing skills.  All ELLs participate in small group instruction,  peer tutoring, and mainstreaming, for our special needs students. All ELL's are included in our science fair, enrichment  programs and  school wide activities (field trips, picnic, holiday shows).       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used are Fundations, Language Power Program, On Our Way to English, Books on Tape, the Leap Frog  Program, and Rosetta Stone.  Where appropriate, laptops, iPads and tape recorders are used.  These instructional programs  enhance our ELLs ability to reach proficiency levels in all modalities. Additionally, native language math and science books,  bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are used in the classroom to support native language.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Books in various native languages are part of the ENL Library as well as a part of our school Library. These libraries include  math books, biographies, fairytales, non-fiction books for social studies and science. We also have a diverse staff, and PTA  parents, who provide native language support such as Spanish, Bengali, Arabic and Chinese.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs who require services/resources receive AIS, Academic ESL After-School programs, small group instruction in the classroom  that address their cognitive needs.  For reading instructional materials are age and grade appropriate.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials used are Fundations, Language Power Program, On Our Way to English, Books on Tape, the Leap Frog  Program, and Rosetta Stone.  Where appropriate, laptops, iPads and tape recorders are used.  These instructional programs  enhance our ELLs ability to reach proficiency levels in all modalities. Additionally, native language math and science books,  bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are used in the classroom to support native language.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Orientation meetings and workshops for both parents and students are given in May and late August for our newly-enrolled  ELLs.   The  newly enrolled ELL Students are screened in preparation for the next school year. Ms. Luciano our ENL teacher, Ms. Seide  our parent coordinator and Mr. Oramas our guidance counselor confer with parents regarding student needs.  Our ENL  programs provide nurturing environments that promote standards-based teaching and learning. All students have access to  standards-based instruction. Instructional strategies reflect scientifically based research such as Leap Frog, Fundations and  Sounds in Motion. Additionally, our literacy-rich environments encourage equitable opportunities for learning, respect and  diversity for all our students. Our goals are to meet the linguistic, social, academic, physical and emotional needs of our ELLs.  We believe that a student’s native language supports progress in English literacy, and therefore all ELLs are provided with the  same high quality instruction that monolingual students receive. With the support of our staff, families, students and school  community, we strive for all of our learners to master the skills necessary to succeed in our highly literate and technological  marketplace.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A:        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher will participate in professional development opportunities throughout the school year.  For the most part, our  ENL teacher participates in the ELL Network and ISC offerings.  She will attend the districts Language and the Brain workshop  of November 6 and she'll attend other district workshops as they're announced.  The information is then turnkeyed to teachers  of ELLs during common preps and at full day staff development days.         All teachers, including our ENL teacher, have opportunities to attend citywide PDs, which are widely publicized via the  Principal’s Weekly attachments or the Principal Portal, and advertised to staff in our Faculty Notes, information bulletin boards  and on STARS.  In addition, our ENL teacher, classroom teachers and support teachers conduct series of seminars to share and  explore best practices in aligning Common Core Standards with ELL needs.  They have discussions, read literature, and  generate lessons and maps that support ELL language development and Common Core achievement.             2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional Development for all school personnel working with ELLs (teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselor,  psychologists, occupational/physical/speech therapists, secretaries, & parent coordinator) is as follows:  •     Language Acquisition  •     Scaffolding Instruction in Literacy, Math & all content areas  •     Balanced Literacy: Considerations for ELLS  •     Using the native language to support English Language acquisition and enrich progress in English literacy, math, and all  content areas.     P.S. 10 will fulfill the requirements as per Part 154 of 15% of total hours of professional development for all teachers and at  least 50% for our ENL teachers.  A Study Group on ELLs will be part of the cycles that will be ongoing throughout the  year.  General ed teachers as well as special ed teachers will be involved.  Information from the the study group will be shared  during grade conference meetings. Teachers will be given an opportunity to join our ELL study group.  The focus of the study  group will be language acquisition, best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instructions  for our ELLs.  Agendas and attendance records are maintained in a binder at the principal's office.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Tuesdays are set aside for parent engagement.  During this time, individual parents of ELLS will be invited in discuss specific  concerns they may have.  If parent needs translation, a school staff member is asked to attend and assist with communication  or the language interpretation unit is called to help.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement includes:  •     Multicultural celebrations are planned throughout the year.  We also have a Parent Diversity Committee that focuses on  augmenting and celebrating diversity.  Their goal is to make P.S. 10 a "no place for hate" school.    •     Parents as Learning Partners  is an opportunity for parents to visit their child's classroom and partake in a teacher created  activity that engages parents and students.  This happens every first Friday of the month and parents are informed via  Konstella, school website and paper notifications in students' yellow communication folder.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Laura Scott, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
