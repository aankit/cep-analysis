This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   As community members of PS 676, administrators, teachers, parents and students are dedicated to improving student  academic performance in order to meet the needs of the “whole child” academically, socially and emotionally; by  creating a community of life long leaders, enabled with tools required to become stakeholders vested in their own  learning. Our goal is to foster a collaborative learning community (all stakeholders) that embraces challenges and  promote our Core Values, Integrity, Resilience, Curiosity, Respect, and Empathy. The values assist in creating a  positive environment aligned with curricula that supports instructional practices with scaffolds that provide all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      constitutes with the supports needed to improve teaching practices, achieve goals (entire community) and promote  student academic proficiency.    The school community is dedicated to creating an environment that is conducive to learning, with a customized  curriculum and an instructional focus in reading, that includes scaffolds for ELLS and SPED’s, as well as push in services  from guidance counselors with special education experiences, to provide students with the resources needed to be  educationally successful.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 676 is a Title one school that is located in the Red Hook Community, our school is faced with families that struggle  with daily situations that impede students learning, poverty, low income, limited education, incarceration, living in  temporary housing, neglect, limited access to health care, depression, parents suffering from generations of mental  health issues, lack of nutrition and lack of appropriate support from parents and family members. Therefore, resulting  in a need for a community school that can provide the community with resources to address concerns that lead to  student social and emotional crisis and instability.    Our constituents collaborate to ensure that all of our students reach their full potential, regardless of their home  environment and their community needs. The school collaborates to listen to constitutes and collect data (surveys,  discussions, observations, open door policy etc.) on the community and incorporate ways to address those needs,  parent workshops, parent coffee hour, cook shop, dental program, washer dryer grant, GED classes and English  classes for ENL parents. Connecting with City Council and seeking support and grant opportunities for discretionary  funding that can be used to provide resources for the school community. Providing the community with town hall  meetings including neighborhood NCO’s, that give the community voice and access to promoting safety and change.  The school seeks help from CBO, through grants such as, Ramapo, Arts Connection, Drumming and Theatre Art that  can provide the entire school with internal and external support to assist in providing educators access points to  engage students; and teacher professional development. Partnerships support the shift in culture and align to Core  Values that can foster an interest in school and essentially increase student social emotional development, while  promoting student achievement.           3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special Student Populations:   Economically Disadvantaged Students   ●One population that we are focusing on is addressing the academic and social-emotional needs of our economically  disadvantaged students. These students have demonstrated that they require social, emotional and behavioral  supports. The classifications of these students range from Learning Disabled, Speech and Language Impaired and  Emotionally Disturbed. Their needs are increasingly growing and they are not being fully addressed. These needs  include but are not limited to mental health. These supports require the resources from a full time guidance  counselor as well as an in class social emotional learning.    Special Education Students    ● Another population of focus are our special education students. These students requires services to better prepare  them to meet grade level standards. Currently, approximately 30% of our student population are students with  disabilities. This year P S 676 is offering an integrated co-teaching class on each grade (K - 5) in addition to a bridge 3-5   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      self-contained class. We want to ensure that the gap between SWDs and General Education students becomes less  significant.      English as New Language Learners-   ● ENL students range from new arrivals to multi-year ELLs. We are designing our program as a full co-teaching model  whereby students are not removed from their classroom but rather the general education and ELL teacher co-plan.  This will provide them the opportunity to implement appropriate grade level lessons with multiple entry points  allowing for both accessibility and differentiation for all students.      Student in Temporary Housing   ● Many of our students (and their parents) require additional emotional and social support in order to be successful  which must be supported through a full-time guidance counselor, social worker, and school-based mental health clinic      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The element of the Framework For Great School that we made most progress over the past year is Supportive  Environment. This year through its change in leadership the school was able to provide the community with a safe  environment, by changing systems and structures, developing protocols, promoting a ladder of leadership, inviting  Community Officers into the building as community support, vision Zero for traffic safety and sharing traffic concerns  with DOT, training staff and teachers on safety related functions, developing a system of accountability for all  stakeholders, open door policy and providing staff with ongoing P.D. This collaboration also allowed for a conducive  supportive relationship with the charter school. These shifts provided the opportunity for the community to become a  safe space, reduce the level of student infractions and reduce behavioral data and OORS reports; resulting in the  removal from the potentially dangerous list.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K676   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   193   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The coherent and rigorous implementation of the CCLS has yet to consistently meet the needs of all students and  enable them to take greater ownership and responsibility for their own learning;   Curriculum and assessments developed this year and aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and  instructional shifts. Teachers were provided Professional Development, throughout the year and over the summer to  develop a better understanding of CCLS. Teachers will use the professional development and provide evidence of  their unit planning document that will support all students with a focus on students with disabilities. This document  will be accessible, with real time data on sped students that teachers can use and share.      Through the implementation of project based learning as an end of unit summative assessment students with  disabilities can demonstrate their learning and take ownership. This work will be addressed in the goal and action plan  of this section with the following considered:   ● Analysis of data including NYS Exams (8% percent in ELA proficiency and 12% in math proficiency. Benchmark Exams  F&P (currently below grade level reading targets, and student work samples and artifacts (projects) monitoring, which  includes midpoint benchmark assessments that are used to provide AIS support and tailor instruction.   ● Development of Unit plans, Curriculum Maps and Pacing calendars with teacher teams that will create lessons that  provide scaffolds for struggling readers, promote proficiency in reading.      ● Deepening teachers understanding of instruction by providing ongoing specific professional development that  focuses on planning and social emotional support. The professional development will be developed in cycles. The first  cycle will provide teachers with Monday PD that include the following once a month on a Monday from September –  January. Every first Monday Faculty meetings to discuss school wide initiatives, system and structures, programming,  announcements, related to safety guidance PD, compliance, SEL support and culture building. Second Monday,  curriculum planning, teachers will be in lower grades and upper grade teams to plan across grades and build  continuum, share practices and ideas. Third Monday, Data and inquiry meetings where teachers learn to access data,  use data understand data and aggregate data to inform their teaching practices and pedagogical approaches to  student needs. Last Monday of the month would be Special education professional development, teachers will have  the opportunity to speak of students with disabilities and at risk students to identify those students who may be in  need of support and create system of checks and balances of interventions to provide students and keep track of  these supports prior to referral for SIT, this data will be collected and discussed at weekly PPC meetings.

Kindergarten  teachers are able to share expectations for students entering kindergarten with pre kindergarten teachers.   ● Professional development is offered weekly to pre kindergarten and kindergarten teachers together across curricular  subjects     ● Parent meetings are held monthly to review CCLS and how parents can support students at home        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Currently we utilize the following sources of data to determine school wide trends and track individual progress:   ● Early Screening Inventory- Revised- This screening is administered to all pre kindergarten students entering school.  This exam is done to in order to determine if students have developmental delays, or if additional language support is  needed.       ● Anecdotal Notes are taken daily. These notes are taken on student during interactions during center time, outdoor  play or any other time where they interact with others. This information is used to plan for future instruction and it is  also shared with parents during meetings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Authentic Student assessments will be utilized throughout the year on a monthly basis. Within the Splash into Pre K  program that we use, assessments are essential for gaining insight into how much children are growing and learning  and allow you to adjust the way you teach to better meet their needs. Observations are conducted before; during and  at the end of each theme to determine if and where students may need additional support across all of the  developmental domains.       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   x                               Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   154,107.00     0    0    0   1,557,210.00        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   ducational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  P.S. 676 Red Hook Neighborhood School for Creativity and Critical Thinking, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 676 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology; workshops   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress; i.e. Teacher engagement time every Tuesday form 2:40-3:15  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;languages including English, Spanish and Chinese   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community   Providing parents the opportunity to lead or assist in school wide Enrichment Clubs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the  school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies  as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical  support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of  the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming  and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for  parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support  services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents  of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be  involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other  applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act ;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;     Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day/Night events   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about  school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 676 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families.

NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

We have developed two programs to focus on the skills needed to  achieve this.  After School ELL Program  The AfterSchool program will focus on ELA/ESL and Math to prepare students for the state  NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments. The program will be offered from February 2019 to  May 2019 on Wednesday and Thursday from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM for 25 sessions. There will be  two groups of 17 to 18 students each, one for grades 2-3 and one for grades 4-5. The students  will be serviced by an ENL teacher and a content area teacher. The students will rotate after one  hour to be serviced by both teachers. The content area teacher will focus on Math and the ESL  teacher will focus on ESL and ELA. We will purchase ENL Classroom Libraries, Getting Ready  for NYSESLAT and Ready Common Core ELA and Math. Attendance rosters will be  maintained in the Principals office in the ENL binder.  Saturday ELL Program  The Saturday program will be offered to the ELL students in grades 2-5. The focus will be  ESL/ELA and Math. The content area teacher will focus on practice of word problems and hands  on activities. The ENL teacher will focus on the Readers and Writers workshop activities using  story books from the classroom library. Students will work with supplementary materials to help  prepare them for the NYSESLAT and ELA assessments. The program will be offered from  March 2019 to May 2019 for 8 Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 12 noon. Groups will rotate after one  and half hour to receive services from both teachers. Materials purchased with Title III funds for  the afterschool program will be used and teacher made activities. Attendance rosters will be  maintained in the Principals office in the ENL binder.

The ENL teacher works with the parent  coordinator on translation on paper and also with parents. The team has workshop for parents  every Friday beginning September 28- May of 2019. Upcoming workshop for this school year  include the following:  Sept 13- Parenting Styles and Managing Problem Behavior  November 29- Helping your Child Navigate Growing Up  January 17, Resolving Conflicts, Communication Problems and Strategies  The ESL and content area teachers will be presenting workshops to parents during the months  March 2019- May 2019 every Thursday from 3-5 p.m. The focus of the workshops is on how to  prepare their children for the ELA and Math State Tests grades (3-5) and NYSESLAT. These  workshops will be paid using title III funds. All attendance rosters are saved by the parent  coordinator in her parent workshop binder. We are fortunate that most of our parents are Spanish  native and the ENL teacher will provide translation if needed.  Other workshop that will presented by the parent coordinator to help parents increase their skills  so that they can better help their students, will be offer from February through June after school.

To assess the early literacy skills of all of our students including the ELLs, PS 676 uses Fountas and Pinnell, Ready Gen weekly  assessments and teachers’  made assessments. The data collected is used to help students who are non readers achieve a  higher level at the end of a targeted period. students  having difficulties learning will  be given additional assistance. Since  most of our Ells are in the lower grades and have shown difficulties with decoding and limited phonemic awareness, the ENL  teacher will target those areas for instruction. Additionally,  vocabulary development is built in our reading block to help  struggling readers. This data provides  a clear picture of the instruction needed to help the ELL's of our school succeed in all  areas. The school uses this  data to create small instructional groups and plan PD in order for teachers to differentiate  instruction for all students in school including the Ells. .        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Our School uses this data to support struggling students and newcomers who are new to our school. Furthermore, the  classroom and ENL teacher will plan lessons together to help those struggling students who are having more difficulties with  learning new concepts.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our program for ELLs by assessing their progress in regards to expressive and receptive  communication in the English language and by tracking their academic progress and monthly on-going assessment.  Furthermore, there is a trend of many students scoring proficient on the NYSESLAT. A large percentage of our Ells who took  the NYSESLAT during the spring  either scored a higher level on speaking and listening. Some students have difficulties with  reading and writing and a few percentage tested out.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our school uses these interventions to address the students' needs in the strands which are most needed and plan instruction  accordingly.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   When our students are not performing at a grade appropriately level, they are evaluated periodically and instruction is  targeted to small groups. Teachers confer with all students including at risk students in order to drive their instruction and  target specific needs. Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework which include three tiers of  differentiated instruction. This intervention decrease in duration over time as the students improve, the extra support is  removed. This extra support occurs in the classroom as well as with the ENL teacher.  We provide Ells with rigorous culturally  responsive instruction and we understand that having a second language is an asset .  Support is gear to helping our ELLs  develop language and literacy across the curriculum.  Assessment is ongoing for students to see immediate results and work  towards better outcomes.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   After looking carefully at our students' results on the NYSESLAT, it is clear that the majority of our ELLs are having difficulties in  the reading /writing modality.  This is true for all proficiencies and across all grade levels.  As a result, classroom teachers in  general and the ENL teacher in particular are focusing instruction on these two modalities. The data also reveals that most  students who took the NYSITELL  have difficulty on the speaking an listening strands. The school will focus on aligning  instruction to address each of these modalities.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher will be working closely with the instructional coach to examine a new curriculum that will enhance instruction  to help meet the needs of all struggling Ells. Additionally, the ENL teacher will attend more training that will  help her plan  appropriate instruction to help meet the needs of our Ell's.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53               Our ENL student population is served by one full time licensed ENL teacher using a combination of push-in and  pull-out model to ensure maximum efficiency and to comply with the mandated service minutes required for each  language proficiency level.  Students get pulled out by grade or by mixed proficiency levels on grades K-2.  The ENL  teacher pushes in to different classes during the week.  Literacy and language development take place through  student participation in the writing workshops, the reading Program Fundations, technology program such as  BrainPop and Open Court, as well as further more specialized instruction from their ENL teacher.  The ENL and  classroom teachers work together to make content area and language instruction accessible to students by employing  differentiated instruction and a wide range of scaffolding techniques. Instructional materials being used to teach the  ELLs include; books on tape, picture dictionaries, guided reading libraries, ENL classroom libraries, texts in native  language, and individualized word walls. In addition to these supports newcomers also receive extra attention  through after school programs, access to literacy technology (including Leap frog and books on tape etc), and  additional academic intervention if needed.           b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.        NA    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               As specified under CR Part 154, all our entering and emerging level English language learners receive 360 minutes of ENL  instruction per week. Our transitional and expanding  students receive the prescribed 180 minutes per week and our  commanding students get 90 minutes of instruction per week. Students are permitted to use their native language with the  teacher, teacher- assistants and/or peers to express understanding and ask for clarification.  In most cases bilingual “buddy  students" are assigned to newcomer ELLs to help with translation of directions and expectations in the mainstream classroom.  Part of the instruction is using a push-in model and part is stand alone ENL.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      We are aware that any group of learners will be made up of students who are at different stages in their language acquisition  and cognitive development; therefore we strive to provide instruction in such a way that addresses the needs of each ELL  subgroup to make content comprehensible and meet the demands of the Common core Learning Standards.           Students are placed with English-speaking peers in an age appropriate environment in order to present them with  language acquisition opportunities that is real and comprehensible and where they are getting support from their peers.  Since  many newcomers arrive with little or no English in any of the four language skill areas, our newcomers receive ENL services  that is intended to provide both content area and second language instruction with the intent of developing both BICS (Basic  Interpersonal Communication  Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency).  Literacy and language  development take place through student participation in the writing workshops, the reading Program Ready Gen and Open  Core, as well as more specialized instruction from their ENL teacher.  The ENL and classroom teachers work together to make  content area and language instruction accessible to students by employing ,  differentiated instruction and a  wide range of  scaffolding techniques. Instructional materials being used to teach the ELLs include; books on tape, picture dictionaries, guided  reading libraries, ENL classroom libraries, texts in native language, and individualized word walls. In addition to these supports  newcomers also receive extra attention through after school programs, access to literacy technology (including Leap Frog and  books on tape etc), and additional academic intervention if needed.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Students are tested in English but some students who require translation are accommodated accordingly. In the classroom  the Native language support is delivered through the use of dictionaries and by grouping students with a bilingual “buddy”.  The ENL teacher and paraprofessionals provide support as needed in the student native language by conversing with them in  the native language and summarizing any concept that is no clearly understood. In some cases assessment is provided in the  student' home language.  The students have the opportunity to have materials in the native language and answer questions in  the language they feel more comfortable with. This evaluation is ongoing throughout the school year.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our schools does not have SIFE students nor long term ELLs . Newcomer students at our school are serviced with the intention  of giving them the language skills they need to function successfully in this new country, community, and school.  They are  placed with English-speaking peers in an age appropriate environment in order to present them with language acquisition  opportunities as well as support from their peers.  Since many newcomers arrive with little or no English in any of the four  language skill areas, our newcomers receive ENL services that are intended to provide both content area and second language  instruction with the intent of developing both BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication  Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic  Language Proficiency) this is also true for developing students . In addition the developing and newcomers receive more  instructional time with the ENL teacher. ELLs that  has been in our system for 4 years ( long term )or more are placed in a at  risk group where scaffolding techniques are use to deliver instruction. The small percentage of long term ELLs also have an  IEP.  The IEP teacher works closely with the ENL teacher to make sure that all students' needs are being met. Some of these  students are in Collaborative Team Teaching (ICT) classes and others are in self-contained classrooms.  As ELLs at our school  reach proficiency by passing the NYSESLAT they continue to receive extra attention in order to ensure academic success. This  extra attention is given through push in and stand along ENL instruction.  Classroom teachers continue their use differentiated  approach to make input comprehensible for these students and design learning activities that connect new content to  students’ prior knowledge. Teachers also use graphic organizers, realias and other scaffolding techniques learned at our in  house staff development sessions. Furthermore, the ENL teacher also assist accordingly depending on each individual case.  Former Ells get the prescribed time and a half for all testing. They also received academic support as needed.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students received ENL services utilizing both a push- in and pull-out model. Some of the strategies used are: listening centers,  pictures with flow of the day(K-2), vocabulary flashcards, peer tutoring, and think pair share for all grades. On staff we also  have the services of 1 language alternate paraprofessional to ensure that the students receive the language skills they need to  function successfully in this new country, community, and school.  They are placed with English-speaking peers in an age  appropriate environment in order to present them with language acquisition opportunities and extrinsic motivation as well as  support from their peers.  They also receive ENL services that are intended to provide both content area and second language  instruction with the intent of developing both BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication  Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic  Language Proficiency). respon: ELLs that  has been in our system for 4 years or more are placed in a at risk group where  scaffolding techniques are use to deliver instruction. The small percentage of long term ELLs also have an IEP.  The IEP teacher  works closely with the ENL coordinator/teacher to make sure that all students' needs are being met. Some of these students  are in Collaborative Team Teaching (ICT) classes and others are in self-contained classrooms. They receive the same treatment  as their English proficient  peers in their classrooms with modifications according to their level and mandated by their  IEP.  Most of our classes have laptops and smart boards these are used to modify instructions for students with disabilities.  All  materials use at our school is Common Core      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      At our school 10% of ELLs  have Individualized Education Plans (IEP). Some of the students are placed in (ICT) classes and  others are in self-contained classrooms. This population receives individualized instruction from their classroom teachers,  teacher assistants (in some cases bilingual), speech and language services as mandated by each student 's IEP.  There is small  group instruction in our ICT classes and the teachers work and plan together to help all students in the class. All our Ells with  IEPs receive the mandated ENL prescribed by their IEP. Planning goes on with the speech and other providers to make sure the  students mandates are being met.  Our related service providers piggyback on what the classroom teacher is teaching to  enhance students' learning. We push in as much as possible to maintain a balanced atmosphere. We  also  mainstream  students who require more rigorous academic work.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ELL population of The Red Hook Neighborhood School is given equal access to all intervention programs. All instruction is  given in the English language with native language support as needed. Our school participates in small group instruction which  is build in our program. During the small group instruction, ELA and math is instructed using skills that will target the  challenges of all our students including the Ells. Our IEP teacher also works with at risk students including those ELL students  with IEP.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Last  year our school was  using Ready Gen for all students including the ELLs. We are discontinuing part of it because the new  curriculum the school is working with is more aligned with state tests and Common Core Standards and it meets the needs of  most of our target students including the ELLs. Ready Gen was discontinued for grades K-2.  This year our school will be  working with a new curriculum; ENL Open Court which is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and is geared to  meeting the learning needs of our population.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The ELL population of The Red Hook Neighborhood School is given equal access to all programs. English Language Learners are  invited to participate in ELA and Math after school programs.  They are also invited to participate in supplementary school  sessions that take place during the winter and spring breaks.  All our students participate in Studio in a School, Learn to Swim,  Physical, Asphalt Green, Activities programs through Good Sheppard Services, and many other community based programs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials being used to teach the ELLs include; books on tape, picture dictionaries, guided reading libraries, ESL  classroom libraries, texts in native language, and individualized word walls. In addition to these supports newcomers also  receive extra attention through after school programs, access to literacy technology like Brain pop, Leap Frog and books on  tape etc), and additional academic intervention if needed.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered through the use of technology, dictionaries and by grouping students with a bilingual  “buddy”.  The ENL teacher and paraprofessionals provide support as needed in the student native language.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The services support and resources we provide our ELLs at the Red Hook Neighborhood School, matches the student age,  grade and proficiency levels. All our Ells are placed in classroom where they interact with students of their own age. A student  who is 6 years old is placed in a 1st grade class regardless of the language they speak.  We provide Ells with rigorous culturally  responsive instruction where they are supported by all adults in our school.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials being used to teach the ELLs include; books on tape, picture dictionaries, guided reading libraries, ESL  classroom libraries, texts in native language, and individualized word walls. In addition to these supports newcomers also  receive extra attention through after school programs, access to literacy technology (including Leap Frog and books on tape  etc), and additional academic intervention if needed.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Good Sheppard Services(CBO) offer after school, winter,  spring and summer program for all students in the Red hook  community including our newly incoming ELLs.  The ENL teacher works closely with all the Ells but gives additional support to  those who are new to the school. The parent coordinator is in the building all year long and supports all our new families.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    NA      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In regards to professional development specifically tailored to the ENL teacher, who attends monthly workshops and  professional developments courses offered by the office of English Language Learners and the school. Professional  development is provided in conjunction to the 3 hours of monthly PD in the Common Core Learning Standards through teacher  support using the Ready Gen Curriculum and Charlotte Danielson framework for teaching rubrics. They are conducted on a bi- monthly basis after school, during weekly workshops and during weekly grade conference meetings. These workshops are  provided by, an assistant principal and principal as well as outside sources throughout the year.    The  minimum 7.5 hours of ELLs training is provided to all staff by outside source.  Professional development focuses on using  Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark assessment system to assess all students. Furthermore, all teacher assistants are involved in  these training and also on the inquiry group where we look at students’ work including the Ells’. Conversations take place  during these meetings about the best ways to help all our struggling students.  In addition, the ENL teacher is encouraged to  attend the yearly NYSABE in the spring, ASCD, and TESOL conferences.  She will also attend Reading and Writing Non-fiction for  ELLs Institute, which will take place throughout the school year. The ENL teacher offers support and suggestions to classroom  teachers about how best to deliver instruction to help meet the needs of any ELL in the classroom.  The support is done  on a  needed basis.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         The ENL teacher, administrators and the parent coordinator will make combined efforts to encourage more parents to get  involved in issues related to our school and assist in the transition of our 5th graders to attend Middle School.  During these  meetings the 5  th   grade teacher is encouraged to meet with all 5  th   grade parents and provide information related to what  is needed to make the last year run smoother. The ENL teacher assist in this process as much as possible.    The ENL teacher is sent to professional development out side and turn key the information to the rest of staff. She also  provides workshops  throughout the year on key language and content support ideas . These trainings are ongoing throughout  the school year and records/agendas  for these PDs are kept in the school file.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents play an integral role in our school. The school works closely with all the parents. There is a PTA committee in place  which meets every month to discuss issues related on how best to meet the needs of all our students including our ELLs.  During these meetings, we assess what parents needs are and the information is shared with all involved. This committee  consists of both parents and teachers. Its goal is to engage parents in the school’s community. The Parental involvement  Committee meets twice a month to plan and implement events/activities that will attract parents to become more active in  the school. There will be a series of workshops given to all parents including parents of ELLs. These workshops will be given  Saturdays/or and after school to accommodate those parents who work. Refreshments will be provided for these workshops  and materials to distribute to parents will be bought using funds available for this purpose. the ENL teacher meets with  individual parents on an ongoing basis and as needed to discuss language progress and goals for their child.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.    Cookshop is a workshop given once a month to help parents plan a healthy meal for their children. This workshop is  conducted by the Parent Coordinator and PTA Committee. Bingo night, training workshop to help your child succeed.  Orientation meetings are scheduled throughout the school year for parents/guardians of newly enrolled ELLs to provide  information on our ENL program. The orientation for new ELL’s will provide an overview of the program and option for  students/parents as described per DOE video for ELLs. The ENL teacher will work closely with the parent coordinator to  provide support to the parents of all ENL students throughout the school year. In addition, the ENL teacher will work closely  with the guidance counselor to ensure that the parents of all 5th grade ELLs are aware of middle school requirements and the  schools that are available at our district.  A number of informational meetings will be held throughout the year and culminating  by May 2016 for all our parents including those parents of ELLs on Common Core Standards, new assessments, effort required  of all the students to improve their performance on tests, and what way school-home connection can help with this crucial  task. Meetings will also be held during the month of April to acquaint parents with the NYSESLAT.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Red Hook Neighborhood                                                                              School DBN: 15K676  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
