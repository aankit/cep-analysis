The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.

Effective School Leadership   The High School for Civil Rights has a planning committee which includes school administrators, teachers, parents and  students as well as representatives from the lead and collaborating partners. We’re dedicated to the ideology of civil  rights, law and community activism into the classroom. In order to ensure that all students at the High School for Civil  Rights (HSCR) succeed, students with special needs and English Language Learners (ELL) are provided additional  supports. Classrooms will be comprised of heterogeneous groups and staff through the use of learned professional  developments techniques will provide differentiated instruction to address the needs and styles of ELL and students  with special needs. Instructors will incorporate project based activities and cooperative learning techniques. In  addition, the special education teachers will work collaboratively with the general education teachers to provide a  continuum of services. However, all students including ELL students and those with special needs will be held to the  same high expectations around learning and achievement.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11         The curriculum is designed around specific themes related to civil rights and law. Themes are infused throughout all  content areas particularly in civil rights and law classes including extended day programming. Major themes include  Voting Rights, Civil Law, Criminology, Police Science, Police Training, Tolerance, Law, & Government.   Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every  classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   The majority of our students are not meeting city and state standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics.

We will continue to  provide common planning time for staff members and administration in order to share ideas and concepts to improve  learning outcomes. Teacher teams are created as systems and structures that will address instruction and daily  operation of the school.      Collaborative Teachers   General education teachers and special education teachers will continue to meet for lesson planning to ensure the  infusion of instructional strategies to meet the needs of both general education and students with special needs.      Teachers will use benchmark data to differentiate and inform instruction. Teachers will attend professional  development conferences and build capacity. Teachers will use portfolio assessment and report cards to track  students’ progress. All teachers will use a uniform grading system in assessing students' progress over time. Teachers  will collaboratively use tools including datacation, roll books and charts to show students' progress. Teachers will be  trained in the use of datacation. The use of datacation/skedula will create an online community of parents, teachers  and students who are well-informed and updated about students’ academic as well as behavioral progress. A strong  collaboration will be evident as teachers and parents communicate through the datacation portal.      Teacher lesson plans/unit plans are evidently planned with differentiated strategies which consider students with  IEPs, gender based learning, students’ reading ability.   Teacher observations and walkthroughs should reveal incorporated different learning styles and student work  products across different learning styles.   Students should confidently articulate why they are working on various projects, assignments, skills or tasks. Students  should show an understanding of the purpose of flexible groupings. Additionally students will be able to explain that  they have set and written their goals for their specific courses. Through this process, students and teachers are jointly  accountable for progress, thereby setting high expectations.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      Teachers assist students in fulfilling predetermined outcomes and competencies by engaging them in rigorous  instruction through content acquisition, critical thinking,   relevance, integration, application of concepts, long term retention and responsibility.      Rigorous Instruction   In academically rigorous classrooms, students actively explore research and solve complex problems to develop a  deep understanding of core academic concepts.   There are opportunities for students to develop and apply habits of mind as they navigate sophisticated and reflective  learning experiences. Students weigh evidence, consider varying viewpoints, see connections, identify patterns,  evaluate outcomes, speculate on possibilities and assess value.   Libraries contain books that cater to various learning styles. Classrooms are all connected to the Internet for easy  access to technology.   Libraries possess a variety of genres. New collection of books labeled according to themes (college and careers,  activism, relationships, empowerment) will be utilized for independent reading to support the balanced literacy  program. Ongoing professional development are being offered campus-wide to improve teacher mastery of  instruction.      Collaborative Teaching   The school has invested in an in-house Collaborative Instructional Teacher to provide ongoing instructional support  for teachers. In addition, teachers also receive instructional support from an additional vendor coach.    Teachers have a shared vision of what good teaching is, which is focused on rigorous instruction, high expectations,  the quality of student engagement, and effective strategies for personalizing learning for all students.   Teachers will meet once per week as teams to discuss students’ work and modify instruction to address the needs of  all students. Teachers will attend grade level meetings to look at student cohorts. Inter-visitation schedules will be  created for teachers.      The High School for Civil Rights has a planning team which includes school administrators, teachers, parents and  students as well as representatives from the lead and collaborating partners, Cypress Hills, Youth Dream Big(Angela  Enterprises), Humanistic Advancement for Long-term Outcomes and Empowering Youths. We’re dedicated to the  ideology of civil rights and community activism into the classroom. In order to ensure that all students at the High  School for Civil Rights (HSCR) succeed, students with special needs and English Language Learners (ELL) will be  provided with additional supports. Classrooms will be comprised of heterogeneous groups and staff through the use  of learned professional developments techniques will provide differentiated instruction to address the needs and  styles of ELL and students with special needs. Instructors will incorporate project based activities and cooperative  learning techniques. In addition the special education teachers will work alongside the general education teachers to  provide a continuum of services.

A Transitional Bilingual Program is created to  support our 9th and 10th graders who are learning English as a New Language.       The curriculum is designed around specific themes related to civil rights and law. Themes are infused throughout all  content areas particularly in civil rights and law classes and extended day programming. Major themes include Voting  Rights, Civil Law, Criminology, Tolerance, Law & Government, Entertainment Law and Police Science.    Students are required to meet the performance standards in all subject areas. In all content areas, students will listen,  speak, read and write for information and understanding. The students as listeners and readers will collect data, facts,  ideas, and discover relationships, concepts and generalizations and use knowledge generated from the theme of the  civil rights movement and current issues in the civil rights. As speakers and writers, they will use oral and written  language that follow accepted convention of the English language to present from a variety of perspectives, their  opinions and judgments and experiences, ideas information and issues.      Data are used diagnostically at frequent intervals by teams of teachers to assess each student’s learning and to  identify the most effective teaching practices. There is time built into schedules for this shared work. Meet with  teachers in regards to how their data from Periodic assessment/classroom assessments should design/determine  targeted lesson planning for students. Teacher teams will meet on a weekly basis to enable at least 100% of the 17  teachers in the school to participate and implement academic rigor and differentiation of instruction in their  classrooms.   Professional development will be offered in gender learning styles and brain development to obtain a deep  understanding of how students learn. Professional development is primarily on-site, intensive, collaborative, and  job-embedded, and is designed and led by educators who model the best teaching and learning practice. All  professional learning communities meetings are about instruction and models of good teaching.   There are well-defined standards and performance assessments for student work at all grade levels. Both teachers  and students understand what quality work looks like, and there is consistency in standards of assessment.      Frequent and rigorous supervision is focused on the improvement of instruction.

Strong Family-Community Ties   Students also learn to problem solve by using a restorative justice approach that emphasizes repairing and reshaping  behavior. This is accomplished through cooperative processes and lead to the transformation of people, relationships  and the community. All cases, workshops and mediation sessions take place in our school courtroom. Partnerships  include The East New York Youth Court and Red Hook Justice Center. These programs train students to serve as jurors,  judges and advocates, handling real-life cases involving their peers. They also work to connect court-involved youth to  strengths-based programming, including art projects and peer education programs. Colleen Babb from the District  Attorney’s Office has made a commitment in collaborating on additional law-related programs at our school. Through  extensive lessons, videos, and field trips, The High School for Civil Rights champions educational programming and  offers a full immersion experience.   Strong Family-Community Ties   As we strive to have all students from the High School for Civil Rights graduate from our school ready for college and  other postsecondary learning opportunities, we strengthen the pipeline by providing early access to college. The  Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation provides us with a college access counselor. Additional support is  provided by Liberty Partnership Programs and Kingsborough College. These supportive services are designed to  increase students’ motivation and ability to complete secondary school and seek meaningful employment. Students  at our school can attend CUNY College Now Courses in both the 11th and 12th grade where they are enrolled in  college-credit and pre-college courses at Medgar Evers College and City Tech College. Students not yet ready to take  college-credit courses take jointly developed courses by college staff and focus on developing academic skills. Some  students are able to earn a high school elective credit for their participation. * We also have the highest ranked  Varsity Basketball player in the City of New York, who is a graduate of the High School for Civil Rights and Law with a  full scholarship to St. Johns University.   We have 9th Grade students who were enrolled in “Public Speaking for Social Justice,” a 12-Week pre-college course  taught by a professor at John Jay College and author of The Ville and Zebra Town. Undergraduate students at John Jay  and staff in CUNY’s high school-college partnership programs provided additional academic support. These programs  worked in conjunction with our school-wide Advancement Via Individualized Determination (AVID) approach that  embraces systems that increase college readiness. In the Advancement via Individual Determination class, each  student receives the following:   • Skills and behaviors for academic success   • Intensive support with tutorials and strong student/teacher relationships   • Positive peer groups   • Sense of hope for personal achievement gained through hard work and determination   In addition to our general school curriculum lead by highly qualified teachers, students take AP Courses in Calculus US  History, Biology, and English. Extended Day Programs are also offered and designed to increase academic  achievement through structured after-school, and weekend classes through a variety of academic and enrichment  activities. Saturday Academy and PM School are offered to further support and prepare students for NYS Regents       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15      Examinations. Students are allowed to register for classes throughout campus. AP Fair is held as an annual  culminating activity where parental involvement is encouraged. College signing is also held as an annual activity  where parents are invited to this event.   APEX and Castle Learning online programs are utilized to support students with credit accumulation and NYS Regents  preparation. All classes, activities and programs at The High School for Civil Rights are shaped around student  centered learning and leadership.    A critical component in developing leadership is through student voice. Our Youth Leadership Council is comprised of  student government leaders, staff, and Community Based Organization representatives who meet weekly to  collectively work with all schools on the campus to ensure that the campus is a safe and supportive learning  environment. Gender based programs such as “Man-Up” and “Sisterhood” programs provide students with a forum  and a safe place where students shared their challenges with a community of mentors and peers who listen and help  them to make better choices. Socioemotional support and resiliency are the main pillars that contribute to the  success of the program. Members also receive assistance with housing for families and job development programs  and services.   HSCR provides a wide range of activities that allow students to take the lead. During “Take Pride Night”, families and  communities are invited to the school to be engaged in students’ presentations of concepts taught in class. Our  Debate Team led by our Social Studies teacher and annual Student Voter Registration Day reinforces the importance  of students making decisions and the power that their voices have on policies that impact their communities. This  presentation was led by a Council Woman. HSCR offers daily activities to students such as “Know Your Rights” and  “Spoken Word”, The Book Club, Chess Club, and Poem in your Pocket Day all helped to create an environment that  ignites critical thinking, embraces student ideas and increases literacy skills.   The students at The High School for Civil Rights have also started using the school’s new Recording Studio. The school  community has access to professional audio recording sessions, CD duplication and audio media transfers. Students  who are interested in music as a career use the recording studio on a regular basis to express themselves through the  arts or just enjoy listening to the creative sounds of their peers. As a school community we understand the  importance of a challenging, college-preparatory curriculum, an appreciation for critical thinking, multiple learning  styles, and collaboration. By providing our students with individualized instruction we hope to see growth and  improvement in the lives of all our students.    Every effort is being made to provide the highest quality instructional program to best meet the needs of your child.   I am confident that the interventions and exciting new programs that have been introduced citywide and at our  school will make this school year a successful experience for your child. Some of the interventions and programs that  are being implemented are:   Strategies to Improve Performance   • Professional development opportunities for all teachers which will focus on new strategies to help struggling  students;   • Saturday School and PM school that provide more assistance with New York State Regents Exam;   • Administrators and Lead Teachers collaborate to provide an Interdisciplinary Approach to improve the quality of  their teaching;   • New teaching strategies with a focus on writing and vocabulary development;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16      • Continued recruitment of highly-qualified and certified teachers to staff our classrooms;   • Strategies to increase daily attendance;   • The use of Innovative Outcomes (Datacation / Skedula) to create an online community of parents, teachers and  students who are well-informed and updated about students’ academic as well as behavioral progress. A strong  collaboration is evident as teachers and parents communicate through the IO portal.    • Data are used diagnostically at frequent intervals by teams of teachers to assess each student’s learning and to  identify the most effective teaching practices. There is time built into schedules for this shared work.   Campus-wide Professional Development.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   There are 60 students who are placed in the Special Education Program. Their needs vary from emotional to academic  challenges. Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) is provided where one general education teacher and one special education  teacher work together in the same classroom to render support. A few of our students receive Special Education  Teacher Support Services. (SETSS). These services are flexible and help students to remain in the general education  classroom and use the combined expertise of both the general education and special education teacher.     There are 40 students in the ENL Program where students are supported based on their reading and writing levels. A  Transitional Bilingual Program is currently in place to support the 9th and 10th graders in the ENL Program. Content  area teachers will collaborate with the Bilingual teachers in the respective subject area.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on School Quality Snapshot, Strong Family Community Ties and Trust received good rating while rating for  rigorous instruction was poor. Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment and Effective School leadership were  fair. Our focus for this school year is rigorous instruction.   Our ninth graders' performance on the Common Core ELA Regents. More than 25 of our ninth graders have passed  the ELA Common Core with 65 and above. One student scored a three (3) on the AP Biology exam.    Analysis of recent NYS Regents data revealed that more focus needed in the areas of social studies and chemistry.    During school year 2016-17 our graduation rate was below 70% due to the large number of students entered school  at level 1 designation. Inconsistency with guidance department    During school year 2010-2011, the graduation rate was more than 75% and students’ performance in mathematics  exceeded the New York State target. That same year, we did not meet the New York State target for English Language  Arts. As a result, our school has shifted from “Good Standing” to a “Focus School until we meet the NYS target for  English Language Arts. According to the Federal No Child Left Behind benchmarks we missed the margin by one point.  While these scores may have existed in previous years, the scores are used to show if progress has been made over a  period of time. A Focus school does not necessarily imply low achievement for a school as a whole. Focus schools can  still make adequate yearly progress for its students. We will concentrate our school improvement efforts on closing  achievement gaps in ELA in order to help all children reach their learning potential.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17               2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           18      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 19K504   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   264   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. High School for Civil Rights, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part  A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       High School for Civil Rights will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach,  communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of  the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The  Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70      provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during  meetings and events as needed; conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend  formal presentations and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      Hosting an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference during the first week in December.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael S. Steele, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           86                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                 School DBN:   Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
