This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Through our interdisciplinary instructional program, students are challenged to make real world connections that  will prepare them for entrance to the college or career of their choice. We do this by providing:     a nurturing and safe learning environment where teachers use questioning and discussion techniques to   encourage students to take risks.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9           opportunities for students to explore their creativity to enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving   skills   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 23 is committed to creating an interdisciplinary program that empowers students to collaborate and use  innovative approaches to learning.    We are a small school serving approximately 290 students in grades Pre-K through 5th Grade in general and special  education. Approximately 22% of our students reside in temporary housing. 33% of our students have an  Individualized Educational Plan. 8% of our students are English Language Learners. In order to support our students  we have partnered up with multiple agencies and community organizations.    Last year we received a grant from the Brooklyn Borough President's office to add a second computer lab to our  school with Z-Space machines (a 3-D) platform). In order to expose our younger students to technology, we are in  the process of creating a lab for grades K-1. This lab has SMART tables, laptops, and multiple defined areas for  project based learning opportunities.    Through a grant from the CASA Association we will continue our partnership and work with the 92Y. Through this  partnership, we provide students with exposure to dance, music, theater, and computer programming. For the last  two years, we have partnered with 92Y with the vision to provide our students with high quality performing arts  programs that supplement the curriculum in place at PS 23. Since working with this prestigious organization, we  have been able to provide our students a wider range of experiences, greater opportunities for personal and  collective success, and possibilities for parent and community engagement. There is evidence to suggest that  attendance improved on days when 92Y programs were scheduled. This is strongly suggestive that a year long,  whole school Performing Arts program will assist in raising attendance habits across the school.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our community is unique in that a fourth of our school’s population is in temporary housing (STH). Additionally, 33%  of our students have an IEP (individualized Educational Plan) and we strive to declassify as many students as possible  placing all students in the least restrictive environment.   Historically, our students in temporary housing have had poor attendance; therefore, we have assigned one of our  paraprofessionals to pick up students from the nearby shelters at 7:30am and bring them to school. As an incentive  for early arrivals, we implemented the CHAMPS program, which requires students to begin the day at 7am. Students  participate in organized sports activity led by our physical education teacher.   About a third of our student population is composed of students with special needs. In order to best service our  students in the least restrictive environment, we have opened up ICT classes in 5 out of the 6 grades that we service.  Having two teachers in each of the ICT classes support students by lowering student/teacher ratio. By June 2018, we  reflected on our student progress and moved about 10% of our students from self-contained classes to ICT classes.  We understand that the majority of our students with IEP learn best through a hands-on approach and have planned  to incorporate the use of technology in the classroom. Currently, we have five computer carts in the school with at  least thirty laptops in each cart.   In addition, we serve English Language Learners through our ENL (English as a New Language) program through push- in and pull-out services. We have scheduled parent workshops to empower with the necessary skills to best support  their children at home. For the last 3 years, we have been part of the District Charter Partnerships Collaborative  Learning pilot. Through this pipeline, we have shared best practices in supporting ENL students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Our Pre-Kindergarten program is supported through the Quality Stars Program and as a participating program in  which we were awarded 4 Stars; Quality Stars is a New York State Program dedicated to providing high  quality/developmentally appropriate early childhood education while preparing children for the academic rigor  needed to be academically & socially successful. Oftentimes, our Pre-K classes are used as model sites for other Pre-k  programs.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As indicated in our Framework for Great Schools Report we have been most successful in cultivating effective school  leadership, strong family community ties, and building trust. In almost all areas we have exceeded the citywide  average in the framework elements. It is our belief that we have been successful in attaining this through sustaining  an open door policy where parents and family members are welcome in the building at any time having access to the  administration, teachers, and staff. Also, serving so many families in a temporary housing setting, we strive to provide  them with clothing, food, and guidance during a difficult time in their lives. Through the NYC Office of School Health  we had the Dept of Health & Mental Hygiene conduct a vision screening for our students whom were then provided  with glasses for no charge; In addition we have also provided dental screening. Representatives from CAMBA  provided families resources to prevent homelessness.    When the shelter system relocates families or they find permanent housing, the overwhelming majority of parents  choose to keep their children here with us not only because of the quality of education they receive, but because of  the family atmosphere we have created and cultivated here.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.

According to the 2016-2017 Quality Review Report, Curriculum is purposefully aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards and instructional shifts. However, feedback by the quality review evaluator stated the need to include  resources for diverse learners, including ELLs and students with disabilities so that they could have access to the  curricula and be cognitively engaged. During the 2017-2018 academic year, we focused providing teacher PD on  designing rigorous tasks for students in both ELA and Math. We revisited our Assessment calendar and refined our  practices for delivering instruction that focused on students' next steps. In the Summative Feedback for SY 2017-2018  of the Principal Performance Review, an area of growth was on QR indicator 2.2-Assessment. The superintendent  highlighted the use of assessment as an area of strength for our school. she stated, "you have intensified your  leadership moves in looking and analyzing assessment results by introducing and implementing the "quadrants" for  student progress monitoring that is now school-wide and provides all teachers with the base for inquiry and planning  for next steps for individual and groups of students."   A comprehensive assessment of our academic program was completed using the most current School Snapshot  Report, QR, MOTP and MOSL data. Our data indicated that although we are making steady increase in ELA, our  students would need additional support in mathematics. From our results of the QR and teacher ratings, the  pedagogy is effective. School leaders and staff have worked on curriculum planning, development of performance  tasks and assessments to monitor student progress. The instructional focus for this year using our data (multiple) to  develop benchmark goals and plan strategic/targeted small group instruction. Teachers are provided item analysis of  ELA and math state exams to support in development of small group and differentiated lessons. With support from  coaches/consultants, teachers are using data more frequently to gear instruction and determine best teaching  practices.   Our priority for next year is to continue designing rigorous tasks that are aligned to major cluster CCLS and to  continuously revisit data to inform small group instruction. We recognize the need to continue to effectively align  these materials to the CCLS through designing coherent instruction specifically in designing, evaluating and  continuously updating curriculum maps. We have chosen to use elements of the Wonders reading program for ELA  instruction. For foundational skills, we will continue to use FUNDations in grades K-2. In addition to utilizing  Fundations, DIBELSNExt will be incorporated and will be used for progress monitoring in order to hone in on targeted  skills. We will also continue to use Wordly Wise as a supplement to build on students' vocabulary.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The Principal’s cabinet is also the interviewing committee, which makes recruitment a process that involves all stake  holders. Final decisions are made by the administration with the committee’s input. Since quality instruction is the  strongest influence on student achievement, teachers are involved in developing their own professional learning  plans. To create quality teachers, we will ensure that staff will have opportunities to develop, grow, and learn from  peers and experts . Staff will lead Professional learning sessions to turn key information obtained during outside  seminars. Preference sheets are always distributed to teachers in regards to their teaching assignments, then 1 on 1  conversations with administrators take place before any possible re-organization is made.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   We have ongoing PD opportunities throughout the school year. Professional Development is regularly scheduled on  Mondays from 2:20pm – 4:00pm. We have a partnership with PS 147, PS 257, and PS 132 to share best practices  aligned to the CCLS.    This year we have been collaborating with staff members from Brooklyn North. We are currently working with Kira  Bonn for support in early literacy, Julia Hynes for support in Math, and Margery Cooper for support in school  environment.   This year the ULIT coach is working with our K-2 grade team on early childhood development. She's working with  Kindergarten teachers in writing and supporting first and second grade teachers with phonics instruction.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Pre-K teachers prepare their children with a curriculum that will help with the transition to Kindergarten through the  following activities: Pre-K and Kindergarten teachers participate in inter-grade conferences, introduce Pre-K students  to their Kindergarten teachers, visit the student cafeteria where they will eat breakfast and lunch when they enter  Kindergarten, participate collaboratively with Kindergarten in special assemblies and events, and hold a parent  orientations are held to discuss Kindergarten student expectations. Additionally, feedback from our Quality Stars  Specialist was incorporated into the Pre-K Parent handbook to assist students with this transition.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        Teachers worked collaboratively and decide on which types of assessments to help monitor student progress. These  assessments are used to identify student weaknesses and strengths. Each Grade had a Grade Team Leader, key  members of the community are members of the Principal's Cabinet; these teams meet disseminate information the  faculty and based of feedback final decisions are made. The data is collected and analyzed to help our teachers modify  and create targeted lesson plans. During our PD sessions/grade conferences, teachers collaborate and share best  practices/strategies.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 14K023 Carter G. Woodson, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part  A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      The Carter G. Woodson Elementary School P.S.23K will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;      provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   ● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessments our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs are the TC Reading Performance Assessment,  MOSL Performance Task, ELL Periodic Assessment, and NYSESLAT as well as unit assessments from the core instructional  program Wonders.  The assessments cover a variety of concepts of print, letter/sound recognition/ reading progression as well  as high-frequency words.  The TCRWP offers a set of informal reading inventories for narrative texts, which correlates, to the  Fountas and Pinnell system for leveling books.  These assessments help teachers identify which level of texts students can read  independently and will, therefore, be able to practice all the reading strategies they are learning during the Reading  Workshop. The MOSL fall and spring baseline assessment provides us with key data that will provide us with students strength  and weaknesses.  The assessments provide an analysis of comprehension, miscues, and fluency( Fluency is only assessed for  Level J-Z).  The data also shows that out of 15 students in grades 3, 4 and 5 87 % of our ELLs scored below the level in the NYS   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ELA assessment.  The data also provides shows us that our ELLs need to strengthen in the area of Reading and Writing.  ELLs  language development and vocabulary development is a crucial element of our instructional plan for English Language  Learners.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   N/A at this time     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To evaluate the success of our program for English Language Learners our school will continue to use the Title III Annual  Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAO) Estimator Tool to inform us of meeting the schools AYP for ELLs. We also  evaluate students success by identifying students growth in performance levels from entering, emerging, transitioning,  expanding and commanding and proficiencies in English Language Arts.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the data is gathered, we look at each component of the data through various lenses to view the areas in which the  students needs are the strongest and/ or needs additional instruction support or intensive explicit support.  Students are then  place in small groups to meet their needs for 6 to 8 weeks intervals focused on their intervention needs, progress monitored  and reassessed to determine if the student requires continued intensive intervention service or modified instructional support.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   To provide ELLs with explicit,systematic, and culturally responsive instruction , a strong Response to Intervention (RTI) model  has been implemented.  This set of guidance has been designed to assist teachers, instructional leaders, and ELLs support  services with RTI implementation, as the model is adapted in each context.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   2017 NYSESLAT Reading and Writing Modality Results: N/A at the moment  Grade/Levels-      Entering        Emerging          Transitioning            Expanding         CommandingKindergarten          7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   N/A at this time            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Meta Integrated  English as a New Language Program (ENL):  The ENL Program for this school will follow a “push-in and pull-out” model.  The teacher will push-in and pull-out a  certain number of students to receive ENL instruction to students at Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and  Commanding levels.  The Entering and Emerging ELL students will receive 360 minutes of E.N.L. instruction per week.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         The Transitioning and Expanding ELL students will receive 180 minutes of Instruction- (90minutes) Integrated ENL and  (90 minutes) Integrated ENL in the Content Area ( ELA, Math, Science and/or Social Studies instruction per week.  It is  a pull-out, push-in program that implements different scaffolds and appropriate strategies to aid in English  acquisition.  The newly arrived ELL students will be instructed by participating in a comfortable low - risk  environment.  They will see behavior modeled by the teacher that fosters gesturing, pointing, active listening, and  responses to commands, constant repetition and increased vocabulary development.  The approach of scaffolding will  be exercised through modeling task completion, activating one’s prior knowledge, TPR (Total Physical Response),  hands on experiences, visual reinforcements (including sight word wall with icons) read aloud, accountable talk  involving small group discussions using various strategies when scaffolding.  Also, positive reinforcement by the  teacher using gestures along with words of encouragement.  The long term ELL students will be instructed by using  proper scaffolds that will help them obtain English Proficiency.  After analyzing their scores on the NYSESLAT, the  teacher will differentiate instruction based on the academic needs of the child forming small groups/teams.  There  will be the following scaffolds in order to achieve maximum results during instruction:  modeling, bridging,  contextualization, schema building, text-representation, and Meta-cognitive development.  The strategies will be  more in depth compared to the instruction for new ELL students.  The strategies will include accountable aids, read  aloud, content word walls with visuals, shared reading, guided reading, visual aids, vocabulary development, shared  writing, conferences, comprehension, reading, graphic organizers, discussions, reflective/strategy charts, word frames  story boards, rubrics, for writing/ reading comprehension, collaborative posters, and thinking maps.  The ENL teacher  will incorporate the Balanced Literacy Model when reinforcing the various strategies to our ELL students.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

The content area is delivered in English with content area  translation dictionaries available to students in their native language.  ENL scaffold consist of metacognitive, contextualizing  information, various forms of thinking maps. Such as, circle map to define content, tree maps to sort and classify, bridge maps  to form analogies and bubble maps to describe their topics.  These maps are used to think about their thinking and to ask  questions and question.  Modifying curriculum, TPR, Native language arts books in their language, scaffolds, vocabulary  development, language experience charts .  Fundations and wonders components will continue to be used for Language  development and core instructional support with English Language components in the Wonders Curriculum program.  We also  will be providing students with trade books from Ladders to support our content area in social studies and science along with  the TC writing units of study in narrative, informational and argumentative  to provide strategies with strengthen their writing  skills.     4.
