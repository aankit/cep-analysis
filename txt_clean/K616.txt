The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service is to provide a student-centered,  challenging and personalized educational experience that empowers over-age and under-credited high school  students to obtain their high school diploma and become fully participating community members, leaders and lifelong  learners.We will also work with students to provide planning for post-secondary success, either through college or a  career. Students will become leaders of social change.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service (Brooklyn Leadership) is a transfer high school that  opened in September 2008, which was created in a partnership between the New York City Department of Education  (DOE), Brooklyn Community Service (the school’s community-based organization (CBO) partner, and New Visions for  Public Schools (the school’s intermediary partner) at the time of opening of the school. Our principal serves as the  Building Safety Principal and our Assistant Principal as the Building Response Team (BRT) Leader.   As dictated by the transfer school model, the school serves students between the ages of 16 - 21 years of age, who  were previously enrolled in a New York City public high school for at least one year and choose to make a change.  Generally, these are students who have had a difficult time adjusting to the culture of a traditional public high school,  have a history of truancy, and were unable to thrive academically and/or socially, encountering various problems in  completing their regular academic program.   Our current 2018-2019 population is comprised of the following: 67% Black, 29% Hispanic, 2 % White, and 2% Asian.  In addition, the student body includes .06% English Language Learners, and 20% special education students, as boys  account for 46% and girls account for 54%. It is also important to note that students who have internships in our Learn  to Work program have a 75% attendance average; students without internships have 39%.    The mission of Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service is to provide a student-centered,  challenging and personalized educational experience that empowers over-age and under-credited high school  students to obtain their high school diploma and become fully participating community members, leaders and lifelong  learners. We will also work with students to provide planning for post-secondary success, either through college or a  career. Student leaders will overcome their obstacles in order to lead social change in their communities.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In 2017-2018, 82.8% of our student population were overaged and undercredited. Additionally, as per the 2017-2018  Progress to Graduation Tracker 51% of students were entering their 5th or higher year in high school. In addition, our  CBO team shared the following demographics of 181 students in our school community for the 2017-2018 school  year:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12      100% of our students have experienced trauma   35% experienced community violence in their neighborhood   9% Students are living in Temporary Housing and unstable homes; doubled-up; shelter; foster care; hotel/motel;   16% students have a history of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, Bi-Polar, PTSD, Trauma Related;   20% Students have a history of legal issues, such as incarceration, outstanding warrants, and arrests   32% students have a history of substance abuse use or dependency   22% students have a history of medical issues such as Asthma and diabetes   8% student have experienced domestic /family violence   6% students are young mothers /fathers;   2% students are pregnant;   5% students have child care Issues;   60% students are over 18   22% students have IEPS/504;    80% are Title I eligible    NYC Environment Survey   Rigorous Instruction 81%; city average was 80%    Collaborative Teachers 97%; city average was 86%   Supportive Environment 80%; city average was 82%   Effective School Leadership 96%; city average was 88%   Strong Family Community Ties 90%; city average was 87%   Trust 97%; city average was 92%             4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the 2017 -2018 school quality snap snot, the following elements are noted as strengths:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13      1. TRUST - Overall rating is excellent with a 97% positive response, 5 percentage points higher than the city average  of 92%   2. EFFECTIVE SCHOOL LEADERSHIP: Overall rating is a 96% positive response, 8 percentage points higher than the  city average of 88%   3. COLLABORATIVE TEACHERS: Overall rating is a 97% positive response, 11 percentage points higher than the city  average of 86%   4. OVERALL RATING FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT: 59% Graduation rate for student enter the school far off track  for their age, 1% higher than the comparison group which was 58%   In 2017- 2018, the school underwent a quality review in which the following successes were found as supporting  evidence:    SUCCESSES WITHIN THE SCHOOL THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD BUILD UPON:   1.  Area 3.4- High Expectations- Proficient   1.  The school provides ongoing information to families regarding student  progress toward college and career readiness. Teacher teams and staff  communicate high expectations for all students. Impact Communication from  school leaders and teachers through systems such as an online grade book  and biweekly progress reports provides opportunities for families and  students to understand student progress toward meeting standards. Daily  advisory check-ins and bi-weekly meetings to review student progress reports  and discuss expectations provide ongoing feedback that prepares students for  the next level   2.  Parents have the opportunity to attend various workshops connected to  graduation and the college application process; thus, supporting families’  understanding of student progress and next steps. For example, parents  attended a transcript evaluation workshop hosted at the school and reported  that before attending the workshop, they were unclear as to what courses  their children needed to graduate. One parent stated, “After that workshop, I  understood what courses my child still needed. It was really helpful.” Parents  also attended workshops on the college application process and completing  financial aid forms. Additionally, the time is provided to support parents with  completing the paperwork involved in the financial aid process.   3.  Teacher teams and staff provide ongoing feedback to students through bi-  weekly progress reports and daily check-ins aligned to student progress. All  students reported that the check-ins and biweekly progress reports help them  stay on track and understand their next steps. One student shared that he  received some ratings of two (out of four) on his most recent progress. After  meeting with his advisor, he created a plan to improve in the areas that were  rated two. Another student reported that she needed to improve on coming  to discussions prepared to cite evidence from texts and other research based  on her most recent progress report. During the daily checkins, advisors meet  individually with students and discuss progress, as well as skills needed for  future success such as persistence. One student stated, and all agreed, “My  advisor holds me to a high standard and calls me out when I am not meeting  expectations.” Therefore, teacher teams and staff provide consistent and  ongoing feedback to support each student.   2.  1.1. Curriculum- Proficient    1.      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             14      1.  School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the  Common Core Learning Standards and integrate the instructional  shifts. Curricula and academic tasks consistently emphasize rigorous  habits and higher-order skills. Impact Careful decision-making by  school leaders and faculty builds coherence and promotes college and  career readiness with an emphasis on embedding student discussions  and literacy protocols into curricular documents. Additionally,  rigorous curricula are accessible for all students, including students  with disabilities and English Language Learners (ELLs).   2.  A review of an English lesson plan revealed that students would   engage in an academic discussion regarding power in our society and  support their claims with text-based responses. In an Earth Science  lesson plan, students will cite specific textual evidence to generate  and answer questions on the life cycle of a star. A Global History  lesson plan included a task asking students to annotate various texts  that demonstrate the dangers of climate change and analyze charts  and data projections for water supply. Therefore, lesson plans  integrate the Common Core and instructional shifts building  coherence throughout the courses.   3.  Review of unit plans and curriculum maps revealed evidence of  alignment to the Common Core, as well as the integration of the  instructional shifts. A Living Environment curriculum map revealed  students must use reasoning and evidence to support their responses  to different prompts. A Global History unit plan included analyzing  complex primary sources and integrating information from diverse  sources, as well as citing evidence from various texts to explain  different perspectives regarding land in the Middle East. An Algebra  unit plan reinforced real-world application through the use of linear  equations to solve real-world problems such as, writing and graphing  an equation that represents the amounts of different tickets  purchased and explaining the rate and slope in the equation.   3.  2.2 Assessment- Proficient   1.  Across classrooms, teachers use rubrics aligned with the school’s curricula.   School leaders and teachers use common assessments to determine student  progress toward goals across grades and subject areas. Impact Teachers  provide students with actionable feedback that students use to improve their  work. Results from benchmark assessments administered across the school,  as well as Regents exam data, are used to adjust curricula and instruction.  Supporting Evidence · Teachers use rubrics aligned with the standards-based  grading policy to evaluate student work products and provide actionable  feedback to students. Some examples of feedback on students’ essays draw  attention to the use of textual evidence to support their claims and writing  stronger conclusions to summarize the essay. Additional feedback on math  tasks revealed that students answered the problem correctly demonstrating a  conceptual understanding, yet point out that they made calculation errors.  One example discusses how a student made a minor error of not including a  sign which had impact on the answer. However, it also noted that the student  demonstrated the conceptual understanding required. One student reported  that she received feedback to add more textual evidence to strengthen her  claim. She said, “I try to do it in all my writing, and now I am meeting  standards.”   2.  Disaggregated data from the Algebra Regents exam and benchmark exams   revealed students were not attempting constructed response questions; thus,   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             15      losing points on the exams. Administration, in collaboration with teachers,  developed a problem-solving protocol to include in math courses. The  protocol included teaching students how to identify key details in the  problem, create a table, and identify an algorithm. Based on the adjustments  made to curricula and instructional practices, there was a thirty-three percent  increase in the recent Algebra Regents exam passing rate   Our key areas of focus is to accelerate learning and implement student to student discussion protocols and  accountable talk stems in all content areas.    DATA GOALS   1. Increase 6 year graduation rate from 33% to 50% by June 2019.   2.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be  SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    The ELT Program for the 2018-2019 school year will increase student outcomes with regards to Graduation Rate,  Regents Growth Percentiles, and Credit Accumulation        Part 2 – ELT Program Type    Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?   X   Voluntary      Compulsory   If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the  goal of serving at least 50% of students.   The ELT program will consist of a variety of high interest, multi- subject programs as well as college and career  readiness programs. To support credit accumulation and graduation rate, while considering the diverse learning  needs of our students, we will offer credit bearing courses in fitness, arts and technology. The ISY program and  Capricorn program will also include a paid internship component that will be connected to attendance.         Part 3 – ELT Program Description    The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of  serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students.  Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   The school will analyze student performance data to identify student groups in need of targeted instruction.  Attendance will also be taken daily and reviewed to measure success. The ELT Program during the 2018-2019 school  year will work with the following student groups in order to improve learning outcomes:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             60      Students reading significantly below grade level (8th Grade ELA scores)   Students in need of College and Career readiness/planning   Students according to cohorts    These groups will be identified through credit accumulation/transcripts, status (SWD, GENED,ENL), and cohort level.  The ELT Program will increase outcomes for these groups by offering courses that capture student interest and  strengthen student learning so as to promote higher attendance, increase credit accumulation, and increase the  likelihood of graduation. The courses will be credit-bearing and offer additional opportunity for academic and socio- emotional growth through differentiated support.    The potential course offerings:   1.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             73     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and   more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             74         IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             75      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy    Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service, in compliance  with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Paste response to questions here:   Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service uses data as a tool that helps us to evaluate the success of our  program for ELLs. This year we have continued to utilize MOSL (measure of student learning), which is a writing assessment for  all students.  As part of the MOSL examination proces, students view a grade level rubric just prior to taking the exam,  then  take the appropriate grade-level assessment.  The MOSL examination requires the students to read and analyze two reading  passages based on their grade level.  The English team, the special education team, and the ESL teachers, meet to norm and  then ultimately score the MOSL examinations. Teachers revise curriculum or individual student plans, based on strengths and  weaknesses, according to the rubric.  This writing exam was administered to the same students, once again, in the spring, in  order to measure their growth in writing.   In addition to the MOSL, all teachers administer some form of diagnostic exam in   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             88      the first week of every new cycle. This can come in many forms, for example it can be a writing prompt in Social Studies, or a  Math exam, or multiple choice questions after the annotation of a reading passage.  This is a good way for teachers to see  where their students are at, in order to inform their lesson planning and building of individual support around learning  targets.  This year all ELL students will be assessed using the running records from TCRWP.  This will provide us with a detailed  reading profile for each ELL which will be shared with the subject teachers.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   - ELL teacher is available to pull students from classes to administer assessments contingent upon required student mandated  minutes as determined by proficiency levels.   - ICT teachers can assist with running records throughout the year.     - Literacy Consultants are available to support ELL and ICT teachers.         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service runs on a trimester that includes 5 benchmarks per cycle. Every  benchmark (approximately every 2 weeks), all students, inclusive of ELL's, take assessments in each class. The students then  receive a progress report for each benchmark. The ELL lead reviews the ELL students' progess reports and completes a data  analysis that reveals individual students' progress in each course as well as their passing rate.   This gives the ESL teachers a  better understanding of exactly where their students may need extra support, and which students are in danger of failing  certain classes.  At the end of every cycle, a Cycle analysis is completed and analyzed for each ELL student, so that we get a  better understanding of where are ELLs are encountering difficulty. In order to foster student success, the data analysis results  help us identify ELL students' academic challenges and drives our planning as a team.  This year, as per the teacher  effectiveness initiative, we administered the MOSL (Measure of Student Learning Exam) in the Fall and Spring.  This  assessment provides feedback on student capacity around the skills required by the CCLS.  The Spring results are used to  identify learning gaps and adjust instruction for ELLs accordingly for the following school year.  These results will show  progress from the baseline established in the Fall.  Gaps will be addressed through different strategies.      The TCRWP Running Records three times a year for ELLs to assess progress.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    - ELL teacher is available for pull-out support.  - ELL teacher is available for push-in to support students in an ICT model.   - ICT teachers support ELLs and SWD students in the classroom.  - ELL teacher confers with subject area teachers and provides instructional strategies to support ELL students.  - Literacy consultants support the analysis of assessments and provide instructional strategies to address student needs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ENL students receive Tier 1 interventions from the ENL and ICT teachers in classes.  Tier 2 interventions are provided by the  ENL teacher during push-in and pull-out sessions.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Paste response to question here:   An initial English language assessment, using the NYSITELL, would be conducted only once at the time of the student's  enrollment in a NYS school. The NYSITELL results will reveal whether or not the student should be classified as LEP/ELL.  Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service is a transfer school. Our students are 16 to 21 and all of our  students come to our school from another high school.  With that, their high school ELL program is already set at the time of   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             89         transfer. Therefore, historically, we have not had to administer the NYSITELL during our intake process.     When examining the NYSESLAT scores of all our ELLs, throughout the years, the data patterns reveal that the ELLs who score  higher on the NYSESLAT modalities tend to do better in classes which require higher order literacy skills. As our ELLs continue  to receive supports and mandated minutes, as determined by their NYSESLAT scores,  they are better equipped to deal with  higher-stake tests like the Regents exams.     The data patterns reveal that students tend to do better in the listening/speaking section than the reading/writing section of  the NYSESLAT exam.  We have also noticed that there is a correlation between credit accumulation and progression on the  NYSESLAT exam.  Upperclassmen tend to perform better on the NYSESLAT. In addition, ENL students who attend classes more  frequently, also perform better on the NYSESLAT modalities.    We also use Regents data from all content areas to evaluate the efficacy of our ELL program and make programmatic changes  as necessary.            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service has a small staff.  This makes disseminating information  easier.  Throughout each cycle, the ELL teacher meets with the instructional and counseling staff to update them on student  progress.  The ELL teacher, Special Education teachers, and guidance counselor meet once a month to review each student in  our program.  We review assessment data from each content area.     NYSESLAT exam and Regents data analysis is shared with the entire staff.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Paste response to questions here:  We offer a Freestanding ENL program. Ms. Mignone delivers instruction in an integrated ELA class for the ELL  students. Stand-alone ENL is also provided, based on student’s English proficiency levels arranged around the  individual’s mandated instructional units of support. Also these stand-alone mandated instructional minutes  are  arranged around two contiguous grades, and of course always provided during the school day.      The ELL teacher also offers push-in and pull-out support depending on mandated minutes.     Students are grouped strategically in their classes – paired with non ELL students at times and with other ELL students  at times. Programmatically, ELL students do not travel as a whole group but are strategically scheduled,  so as to  optimize integrated/stand-alone support around their mandated minutes.            b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:   N/A     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             90         c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:   N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Paste response to questions here:    Our Guidance Counselor, Celeste Maxwell, creates a chart every cycle to calculate the number of minutes for each student per  week.    Each ELL student has an ELA class as well as the mandated instructional minutes of ENL. Our Emerging students receive 360  minutes, or more, per week of support services.  Transitioning students receive 180 minutes per week of support  services.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes per week.  Our Former ELLs/ Commanding students will receive 90 minutes  per week of support, for two additional years.  It is typical for our students to receive more minutes than required by the NYS  CR Part 154.2.   HLA            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Paste response here:             In our ENL program, content area in each subject area, is delivered by the respective teacher. The ENL teacher and the  content area teacher team teach in an integrated ENL class, in order to deliver support to ENL student and teacher.  Our  integrated ENL model also satisfies our ENL students’ mandated minutes, based on their level. The ENL teacher is available to  the student in programmed classes for assistance.  The ESL teacher also makes herself available to students, as needed, for any  other content material.  This assistance can come before and after school, and during lunch.  ENL teacher also supports  content area teachers during weekly professional development sessions around common core shifts and inquiry.  By working  closely with the different content area teachers, as a team, possible academic misunderstandings, academic vocabulary, are  anticipated and strategies are developed to support ELLs.     In the content areas, instructional approaches/methods used with ELLs include  o     Context clue work for difficult vocabulary  o     Prior vocabulary assessment   o     Read Aloud with modeling of literacy strategies   o     Graphic organizers for writing supports, annotation guides/keys  o     If needed, textbook glossary and Spanish translation dictionaries  o     One on one direct reading instruction     o     Speaking and listening activities such as group discussion protocols, Socratic Seminar, presentations, etc.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      In our ENL program, content area in each subject area, is delivered by the respective teacher. The ENL teacher and the  content area teacher team teach in an integrated ENL class, in order to deliver support to ENL student and teacher.  Our  integrated ENL model also satisfies our ESL students’ mandated minutes, based on their level. The ENL teachers are available  to the student in programmed classes for assistance.  The ENL teacher also makes herself available to students, as needed, for  any other content material.  This assistance can come before and/or after school, and during student lunch.  The ENL teacher  also supports content area teachers during weekly professional development sessions around common core shifts and   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             91      inquiry.  By working closely with the different content area teachers, as a team, possible academic misunderstandings,  academic vocabulary, are anticipated and strategies are developed to support ELLs.     In the content areas, instructional approaches/methods used with ELLs include  o     Context clue work for difficult vocabulary  o     Prior vocabulary assessment   o     Read Aloud with modeling of literacy strategies   o     Graphic organizers for writing supports, annotation guides/keys  o     If needed, textbook glossary and Spanish translation dictionaries  o     One on one direct reading instruction     o     Speaking and listening activities such as group discussion protocols, Socratic Seminar, presentations, etc.                  At the present time, our nine ELLs all entered our school with the same program in place: Freestanding ENL.  After  evaluating their transcripts, from their former high school, and consulting with their parents during intake, and sending out the  continued entitlement letters, we have found that our nine students are suited for the freestanding ENL placement.  Our  students are not proficient in their home languages in order to warrant evaluation in their native languages, at the present  time.  If the need arises and we would have the correct amount of students, then we would open up a class for either TBE or  Dual Language, as well.  If needed we can also use the translation services, if an exam needed to be translated in the Native  Language.  Also our textbooks have a Spanish/English glossary, and if needed we could order certain assessments in the native  language (Regents, textbook unit exams, etc.).  Our ELLs are not proficient in their native language and have appropriate  testing modifications available, including translation dictionaries, and time and a half for all state exams.                 5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Paste response to questions here:    a.  For SIFE students we consider how standards and the curriculum can be adapted so that those students learn critical  material in a way that is effective, accessible, and age-appropriate.  We basically assess where the SIFE student is at  academically, as well as linguistically.  We also try to analyze or decipher the extent of their formal education in their country,  so that we can best support them in all content areas.  We also are able to better communicate the anticipated problem areas  and students' history with all staff.  b.     At the moment we do not have any newcomers, but in the future we will adjust our program to meet the needs of these  students, by assessing their language abilities, in both English and the Native Language, to determine how to best support  them.  c-d Our developing ELLs and long term ELLs continue to be supported by the ENL program as described above and receive  more than the mandated minutes required. Additionally the ELL teachers are in continual communication with all the ESL  student’s teachers, their advocate counselors and their parents. Ms. Mignone also supports students by tutoring.  e. Former ELLs,  after 2 years of testing proficient, are still provided with testing accommodations, on state-wide exams.  We  still monitor their classroom performances, and continue to make available any type of classroom supports that will help them  to be successful. Of course, our former ELLs continue to receive services for an additional two years. Former ELLs also are  programmed for at least .5 units of study per week of integrated ENL in ENL/Content Area Classes. One of our former ELLs,  Edgar Jimenez, exited ELL status at the end of the 2015-2016 school year.so next year, 2017-2018 will be his 2nd year as a  former ELL. Edgar is monitored closely by the ENL teacher, and he continues to thrive. He will be graduating, once he passes  his US History Regents and acquires some remaining credits.  Edgar came to our school very low-credited, and has since gained  credits, and is thriving socially, in our community, by getting involved in Documentary Film-Making, and as a student leader in  Scholar Squads Academic Competition.      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             92         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Paste response to question here:    We use a variety of resources and strategies to help support our ELLs and our SWDs.  Currently we have one ELL who require  Special Education Support Services. This student has an ELL program that also includes modifications and supports that are  identified in the IEP.  In our English Classes we are supported by  literacy consultants, who helps support the teachers with  strategies for increasing reading and writing stamina.    The ENL teacher makes content comprehensible to our 9 ELLs by applying different learning strategies.  This allows the  students to see that a certain task is actually within their reach, if it is broken down, in a certain way.  Such strategies include  using prior knowledge, graphic organizers, reference materials, and context clues; planning; note taking; questioning; exploring  cognates and root words; and applying ideas to new settings or experiences.  All of the aforementioned strategies enhance the  ELLs opportunity to listen, speak, read, and write in English for information and understanding.  The ENL teacher works with  the content area teacher to best support them in classes where they may be having difficulty.  Teachers differentiate for the  different learners and help make material matter comprehensible to ELLs, SWDs, and all types of learners. We also utilize  smart boards, desktop computers and laptop computers, which are available for every classroom, in order to enhance the  learner’s experience through diverse modes of instruction by using video, image, and interactive software to allow ELLs and  SWD learners to access all aspects of the curriculum.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Paste response to question here:    We use a variety of resources and strategies to help support our ELLs and our SWDs.  Currently we have two ELLs, who  requires Special Education Support Services. ELLs with disabilities receive a program that includes modifications and supports  identified in their IEP.  Students are scheduled based upon credit needs and also their mandated contact minutes with ENL  support. Students with disabilities receive integrative ENL interventions in a team teaching model that employs supports for all  learners across content areas, and stand-alone ENL services employed by the certified ENL teacher. Of course all SWDs receive  support from co-teaching and individualized support, from their respective Special Education teacher.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Paste response to question here:    Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service meets the needs of our 8  ELL students by providing an  individualized, standard-based, holistic education that also considers the students’ socio-emotional needs. Translation  dictionaries are available to support our students, and our ENL teacher speaks Italian and Spanish - Our ENL students speak  Spanish, French, and Haitian/Creole. As we have a small number of ELL students, we are able give all of our ELL students (in all  subgroups) targeted, individualized attention. Through diligent communication, our ELL teachers assess the needs of the  students, and direct the students to receive the supplemental support they need in all areas; academic and beyond. Every  young person, including ELLs have an advocate counselor (with an approximate caseload of 30 students) who helps to direct  their students socially, emotionally, and academically. We also have one guidance counselor,  two MSWs on staff, a campus  School Based Support Team, and a rich Learn to Work (LTW internship program and a Learn to Work internship coordinator),  as well as an ISY Program(on-site) which helps participants graduate from high school, pursue college education, and develop  career goals.  Additionally, we have an on site related service provider, and offer integrated, co- taught US History, Global  History,  and English classes  .  One to one tutoring is available before and after school hours, and flourishes during student  lunch.  Our students have access to screened  volunteer tutors provided by the CBO, our partner here at Brooklyn Leadership.

Last year another guidance counselor, dedicated to ELL and SWD services, was hired, to further support  our students. Transition plans and college counseling will also be provided. The Guidance department is also supported by a  building wide School Based Support Team that includes a school psychologist. In addition Brooklyn High School for Leadership  and Community Service is a transfer school partnered with an on site,  full time, CBO that consists of six advocate counselors-  two of which are MSW; a Learn to Work internship coordinator, a program director who is a former DOE teacher, and an  assistant program director who is an MSW.  Advocate counselors have an approximate caseload of 35 students and support  students through advisories and individual counseling. Advocate Counselors have a 30 minute  advisory daily. We also offer  differentiated support groups including College Counseling and  Art therapy.     For SIFE students we consider how standards and the curriculum can be adapted so that those students learn critical material  in a way that is effective, accessible, and age-appropriate.  We basically assess where the SIFE student is at academically, as   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             94      well as linguistically.  We also try to analyze or decipher the extent of their formal education in their country, so that we can  best support them in all content areas.  We also are able to better communicate the anticipated problem areas and students'  history with all staff. At the moment we do not have any newcomers, but in the future we will adjust our program to meet the  needs of these students by assessing their language abilities, in both English and the Native Language, to determine how to  best support them. Our 4-6 year ELLs and long term ELLs continue to be supported by the ESL program as described above and  receive more than the mandated minutes required. Additionally the ELL coordinator is in continual communication with all the  ENL students' teachers, their advocate counselors, and their parents/guardians. Ms. Mignone supports students by tutoring  before and after school hours, as well as during lunch.  Former ELLs will continue to receive services for an additional 2 years  and are still provided with testing accommodations, on state-wide exams.  We still monitor their classroom performances, and  continue to make available any type of classroom supports that will help them to be successful. In addition will receive .5 units  of study of integrated ENL in ELA or a Content Area,  as per CR Part 154.2               9.

These films are showcased during school-wide film screenings.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Paste response to question here:   At the present time we offer a freestanding ENL program to our nine ELL students.  Our students are not proficient in their  home language and prefer instruction to be delivered in English.  If needed we can also use the translation services if an exam  needed to be translated in the Native Language.  Also our textbooks have a Spanish/English glossary, and if needed we could  order certain assessments in the native language (Regents, textbook units, exams, etc.).         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Paste response to question here:   We are a transfer school serving 16-21 year olds.  We must be mindful of students' eligibility for a high school  diploma.  Guidance and Advocate counselors are in constant discussion with students regarding their credit accumulation and  regents progress.   Teachers complete a benchmark for all of the classes they teach, every two weeks, and the ESL teacher  does her own individual benchmark analysis for each ESL student.           15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Paste response to question here:   Technology is infused into the curriculum. Smart boards are used in every classroom; Laptop Carts are in every classroom;  Desktop computers and multiple printers are in every classroom. The MOSL(Measure of Student Learning)– is administered, in  the beginning of the school year to provide us with a baseline assessment for entire school to determine literacy/writing levels  of all students. The data is assessed to inform teachers of student levels, and as a result better inform their planning for   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             96         increased outcomes regarding writing. The reading/writing exam is administered, once again at the end of the year, to track  progress.  Through our film program, students create short documentary films about bullying, culture, language, respect .

Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Paste response to question here:   Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service is a transfer school for overage under-credited youth. We have a  comprehensive intake process which helps to assist newly enrolled ENL students. Individuals responsible for this process are  Stacey Fischler, Program Director,Tanisha Williams, Assistant Program Director, and Intake Coordinator, Heather Hansen.  Ms.  Williams is also our Parent Coordinator.  Additionally, before the onset of the school year, the school holds a student  orientation to further inform students about our school.  The orientation process includes an overview of school policies,  roles  of staff and students, social work services on site and any and all programs that the school offer. Students also participate in  leadership, ice-breakers and school scenario activities. ENL students are also provided a survey. Once programmed, by our  Guidance Counselor, Celeste Maxwell, students are grouped heterogeneously.  In their heterogeneous grouping individual  needs of each student, inclusive of ELLs are specifically addressed, and instruction is tailored and differentiated accordingly.  We also offer a myriad of electives to foster student engagement: two Italian Art Language and Culture classes, two film  classes: Government through Film and Documentary Film-Making,  Art Class, Forensics, Robotics.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Paste response to question here:    Currently Italian 1 & Italian 2 are the language electives offered to all students. The language class covers Italian Art, Language,  and Culture. We also have APEX Online Course in Spanish, available to students who need to get their credits online.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:    N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Paste response to question here:  The professional development plan for all ENL, content area, and special eduation teachers at the school is centered around  The Framework for Great Schools. Particular attention will be paid during professional learning to Quality Review Indicators 1.2  (Pedagogy), 2.2 (Assessment) and 3.4 (High Expectations).  The ENL teacher will learn to pre-assess ENL students, and craft  personalized instruction plans and accommodations, and differentiate lessons to engage ELLs in the learning environment. In  addition, the ENL coordinator regularly meets with the guidance counselor and the assistant principal regarding ENL data as  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             97      well as the ways in which we can best support our ENL population academically and programmatically.   The ENL teacher  knows the importance of assessment, both formative and summative, in determining where student skill needs are  occurring.  Teachers then use that assessment data to determine where to shift course, instructionally.  ENL teachers will  modify curriculum regularly based on student work analysis and performance levels. This year, the following professional  learning activties will take place:  •     Teachers will use rubrics in instruction and to deliver actionable “next steps” to the students in order to increase student  performance and teacher growth  •                 Teachers will continue to use standards-based grading, which provides for more immediate feedback to the learner,  thus empowering the student to take ownership of his/her learning  •                Teachers will provide a learning target, in the form of an "I can" statement, for daily lessons  •                  Exit Tickets will be aligned to the learning target  •     Assessments and rubrics will be aligned across departments   •     Teachers will utilize department-aligned formative assessments to deliver informal feedback, adjust curricula and move  students toward mastery  •     Teachers will track student progress on assessments to adjust curricula and move students toward mastery  •     Each cycle, 100% of teachers will produce a CCLS-aligned curriculum map for each course  •     Each teacher will provide opportunity for students to work with complex text (close reading and annotation) twice weekly  (more in ELA classes)   •     Each teacher will require at least one extended writing project per Cycle, one formal writing product per benchmark, and  the opportunity for informal writing in each daily lesson  •     Each teacher will hold one formal, student-led discussion per benchmark, as well as daily opportunities for shorter  informal conversations.    •     Every benchmark, teachers will meet in teacher teams to measure student tasks and work products using Depth of  Knowledge for rigor and higher-order thinking opportunities as well as the NYC Performance Assessment Rubric to identify and  target literacy skill gaps     The professional development that is offered to teachers of ELL in supporting their engagement with the Common Core  Learning Standards focuses on deconstructing the standards to parse out content and skill requirements of the  Standards.  Once teachers determine the exact content and skill parameters of the standards, they are able to shape  curriculum based on the ELL students’ skill strengths and weaknesses.  There is a special focus on the matter of text complexity  and literacy across the content areas.  ELL teachers are equipped with knowledge of what makes a text “complex” and literacy  strategies to both scaffold difficult texts for students and then to increase student independence around complex text work.     o    Teachers will complete CCLS Deconstruction Chart for all assessed Standards in their course.  Teachers will pick out out the  content and skills for each standard, so as to determine which scaffolds/sequence of instruction, will best support ELLs  o     Teachers will infuse literacy work into curriculum maps across content areas so that students receive consistent, aligned  practice that leads to mastery of necessary literacy skills.  Teachers will understand what the CCLS reading standards require of  students so that they might be able to determine which resources would best support ENL students  o     Teachers will create a multi-level CCLS-aligned assessment that addresses the requirement of the standard but is  accessible to all students.  Teachers will research resources to use in supporting student’s navigation of the assessment.              2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development.

Master binders of sign-ins/materials are kept as well as personal teacher portfolios of  training materials.  Records are reviewed with the principal at weekly supervision meetings.  The ENL teacher updates the  teachers in the beginning of each of the three Cycles as to which of their current students are ELLs.  The ENL teacher also  updates the teachers as to the ENL student's proficiency level on the past NYSESLAT test in all modalities: Listening, Speaking,  Reading, and Writing.  During Professional Development, on Mondays, the teaching staff meet and have time to discuss any  concerns about any of the ELLs.  In addition, on Tuesdays, teachers and counselors meet for case conferencing where further  discussion about students, like ELLs, IEP students, and General Education students takes place.  The Guidance Counselor,  Celeste Maxwell, meets with our ENL teacher for periodic meeting, every two weeks, to discuss the ELLs and their  performances on their progress reports, after benchmark grades are entered.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Paste response to question here:  •     Parent Orientation Night initiates a formal orientation to school staff, programs and opportunities for parental  involvement.  The school principal, assistant principal, program director, and assistant program director/parent coordinator  provides an overview to parents of materials and trainings to help parents work with their children to improve their  achievement level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology.  The school will continue to provide parents with materials and  necessary trainings throughout the school year via PTA & SLT meetings and mail.  Parent Orientation materials for this year  included Mission and Vision of Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service, common Core FAQ, Student  Handbooks, Benchmark dates for 2017-2018, Regent Calendar for 2017-2018, Advocate Counselor contact details,  and a  Parent Survey to identify parental interests, workshops and activities.   •     Throughout the school year we will provide assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and  assessments.  At Parent Orientation Night the common core standards and the CEP goals are reviewed, with parents. Also  during general monthly PTA meetings, instructional information, curriculum, and common core shifts are explained to  parents.  The parent coordinator is also bilingual and translates and provides information to parents as needed.  •     Throughout the school year we share information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities  in a format, and in languages that parents can understand. We will anticipate different home language needs, based on the  ATS report, so that these materials will be readily available in translated form for those families.  The information is shared via  school meetings, school messenger, and via mail to ensure parents are fully aware and participating partners at the  school.  We have advocate counselors. who are proficient in Spanish,  and provide translated  information to parents as  needed.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Services assesses the school written and oral interpretation  policy by surveying parents and students to confirm that the relevant materials are received by and  communicated to families on an ongoing basis. Our language assessment begins with a comprehensive intake  process that includes:    • Student information session    • Parent and Student survey    • Initial interview with student, parent/guardian and advocate counselor    2018-19 SCEP-P  103                                                                                                                                                                                                                     • Intake examination that assesses student levels and needs in reading, writing and mathematics    • Family interview with student, parent and Social Worker    Other ways in which are identified:    • Home Language Identification Survey    • District level identification    • Staff recommendation    • ATS Reports    Each student at Brooklyn Leadership is assigned an Advocate Counselor. The counselor is in constant contact with  the students and Parents/Guardians of his/her caseload. The Counselor is also aware of the language spoken at  home by the parent/guardian, when contacting the parents via phone or sending information home. Counselors  are also the main staff involved in all intake of any new admits. They are involved in the student interview, as well  as with the parent interview, during the intake process. NYCDOE Translation Services are also available to the  Advocate Counselors. The advocate counselor will record this information in the student's case file. In addition,  the list preferred home language will be distributed to all staff during meetings. Additionally, this school year we  have linked our ESL teacher/LAC coordinator as the co-teacher in the advisory, where all past and new ELLs are  programmed.    Throughout the school year we will share information with parents about school and parent related programs in a  format, and in languages that parents can understand. The Parent Coordinator is bilingual and will translate all  critical school documents, including the school’s identification for school improvement to Spanish, while also  providing interpretation to Spanish speakers during meetings and events. In addition, the school will contact the  Department of Education’s translation services at translations@schools.nyc.gov, to translate the notification for  parents and families whose home languages include: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Korean,  Russian, Spanish and Urdu. An external contract will be sought out for languages other than what the translation  services provided.    Additional ways that we will collect data throughout the year will be by gathering information from the ATS  Report of Preferred Languages. Our LAC Coordinator has been surveying the teachers, by collecting data about  home languages/home language preferences, by class.We are contantly gathering information because our intake  process is ongoing throughout the year. We collect/continue to collect this information from parent surveys,  parent surveys, teacher surveys(by class data), and Blue Card Data. Our information is regularly updated with the  languages that parents speak, by class and grade.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

To fullfill Section Vii of Chancelor's Regulation 663, we will provide each parent with a Bill of Parent's rights. These  rights will be distributed at parent meetings, mailed, and backpacked with students. We will post a sign which  indicates our interpretation services available near the main office, as well as in the guidance counseling suites.  Parents will reach out to advocate counselors in times of crisis. Advocate counselors, who know the languages of the  parents on their caseload, will utilize translation services to communicate when needed.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Teachers, Advocate Conselors and Guidance Counselors are in constant contact with parent/guardians. Parent needs  are monitored by the SLT, which has both student and parent representation, as well as our PTA, which meets  monthly, to discuss concerns and the needs of our parents and families. Parent Surveys are distributed to monitor  how effectively the parents' needs are being met, in regard to the quality and availability of any and all services,  meant to support the community, as a whole. At the next parent meeting we will distribute a survey so that we can  gather a focus group of parents, inclusive of all cultures and languages, in our school to better gather feedback and  best practices for all staff, when dealing with our diverse population.         2018-19 SCEP-P  107
