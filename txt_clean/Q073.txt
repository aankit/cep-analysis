This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Frank Sansivieiri Intermediate School 73 strives to promote a school culture that promotes high academic  expectations with social emotional supports. We believe that a strong delivery of instruction combined with an  appropriate level of academic rigor and supports both academically and socially will benefit our students. We believe  that students will rise as their expectations rise and always make 73 the place to be!      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                        2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Frank Sansivieri Intermediate School currently has 1,978 students on register. Our diverse student population is  composed of 18% English Language Learners and 18% Students with Disabilities. Our predominant home languages  are English, Chinese and Spanish. The student population at IS 73 reflects our diverse Maspeth community. At Frank  Sansivieri Intermediate School, it is our mission to focus on the individual needs of each of our students including our  English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. We work to foster a culture in which every member of the IS  73 community is valued and respected. Our philosophy is built upon a foundation of our core beliefs: Respect,  Responsibility, Cooperation and Achievement.   Our student population is offered a multitude of programs such as, Beacon Gifted and Talented, Dual Language in  Spanish, SP/Honors program, General Education, English Language Learner, and Special Education. Our Beacon Gifted  and Talented program as well as our SP programs are all on track to participate in the regents of Living Environment,  Earth Science, and Algebra. This is in addition to an already accelerated program in all grades. Our Dual Language  programs offers students a rigorous, enrichment experience as 50% of the class is taught in English and 50% is taught  in Spanish, with the overall goal of becoming biliterate in both languages. Our General Education program offers  students an engaging, rigorous curriculum that works students towards taking more autonomy over their learning by  goal setting, student to student feedback, self reflection and experience in project based learning. Our English  Language Learner programs vary from entering to commanding levels and are provided an engaging, rigorous  curriculum with multiple entry points to support their learning. Our Special Education program offers students a  variety of programs such as SETSS, ICT, and self contained models dependent upon their need. Our expectations are  high for all student populations and we use student data to inform our instructional decisions to support all students,  no matter what program they may be in to meet our high expectations to be high school, college and career ready.      In an effort to create smaller learning environments, our school is separated into 5 “Academies.” Each academy is  created equally with all subgroups included in each. Each academy has an “Academy Team” that consists of an  Assistant Principal, Guidance Counselor, and Dean. Each academy team oversee student designated into their  academy in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grade, allowing a relationship to foster with the student and family to better support  their needs.       To expose our student body in the arts, we have increased student choice in selecting the art of their preference. In  the 6th grade students experience our “Elements” program. Each student is rotated through 4 different arts  throughout the year. This provides them an introduction to different arts that they may have a strong interest in. In  the 7th and 8th grade students are provided a choice of 3 arts to focus on for their next 2 school years. This is  particularly supportive to our students who have strong interest in pursuing an arts education in High School as our  arts teachers can support students in building a portfolio in gaining admittance into an arts high school. We are  fortunate to be able to have available for our students to choose from, Art, Band, Chorus, Dance, and Drama.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         I.S. 73 has an ongoing partnership with Maspeth Town Hall, a program that runs Monday through Friday from 2:20 –  5:00 p.m. This program is an extension of our school day and assists students with their academic and social- emotional needs through developing small group collaborations within its members. Students participate in a variety  of activities including Robotics, Music instruction, Homework Help, and a multitude of sports.      Some of our other current partnerships are targeted towards further exposing our students to the Arts and Sciences.  These partnerships include a number of showcases for our students, professional development for our teachers and  field trip opportunities for a variety of classes.      The partnerships that focus on allowing our students to experience the Arts & Sciences include:     New Victory Theater  Shakespeare to Go      Reach for the Stars    Metropolitan Museum of Art    NY Hall of Science    Metropolitan Opera House    American Ballet Theatre    New York City Ballet   Some additional organizations that I.S. 73 has partnerships with include:   St. Jude’s       Pi 5 Citywide Invitational Math Tournament    C.H.A.M.P.S    NY Road Runners      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our diverse school includes Special Education population, and English Language Learner population. In addtion, we  have a population of English Language Learners who also are a Special Education student. Our Special Education  populations needs are outlined and addressed through their Individualized Educational Plans (IEP's) as well as further  support within the classrooms such as scaffolds, manipulatives, and computer software programs. Our English  Language Learners population needs are additional support in speaking, writing, and reading of the English langauge.  These needs are addressed through ENL services and ENL instructional strategies such as Collaborative Strategic  Reading (CSR) and Book Tasting. In addition, students are enrolled in our Title III before or after school program and a  Saturday program. Our English Language Learner students who are also a Special Education student will recieve  similar instructional approaches to support their learning.       4.

Our school’s accountability status for the 2017-18 school year is “Good Standing.” According to our school’s  performance on the 2017 NY State ELA Exam, 47.1% of our students scored a proficiency rating of levels 3 and 4. Our  students grew 7% overall in ELA from the 2015-2016 school year to the 2016-2017 school year in students scoring a  proficiency rating of levels 3 and 4. The percentage of students with disabilities who scored a level 1 proficiency rating  in 2017 decreased by 10.9% from the previous year's ELA Exam, from 59.7% to 48.8%. The percentage of English  Language Learners who scored a proficiency rating of level 1 decreased from the previous year's ELA Exam by 9%,  from 74% to 65%.       During the 2017-2018 school year we applied to the Middle School Quality Initative (MSQI) provided by the New York  City Department of Education. We were accepted and have begun working with MSQI on our literacy vision, the  implementation of the program "Word Generation" to increase students comprehension of academic vocabulary  through and interdisciplinary lense, and the use of the DRP that will assess students in the beginning of the year, in  the middle of the year, and at the end of the year to monitor student progress in reading. Our implementation focus  will be with our 6th grade students, however, all students will be exposed to an increase of interdisciplinary work that  will support students in a deeper understanding of non-fiction text and real world applications.      Our main focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be to support our students overall comprehension of literacy within  an interdisciplinary lense. Our ELA and Social Studies teachers have already begun revising curriculum that will  collaborate and join to create a humanities based curriculum to support students connections to the real world.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  As we continue our efforts in supporting students to make good choices, we want to continue to expand our PBIS  program. 2016-2017 was our first year of school wide implementation in which the creation of "Bee Bucks" began to  be given to students for making good choices. Students were able to redeem their bee bucks for ice cream, positive  phone calls home, and background pictures at school dances. While it was a good start, our challenge was  communication to staff and students as well as organization. To better support the implementation for the upcoming  school year, two teachers will take on the coordination and organization to better support the program. In addition,  more rewards that are free of charge for the school will be incorporated for students to select from.       2017-2018 saw an increase of both an awareness of PBIS and the use of "Bee Bucks" during the school day. The use of  our mobile store to redeem "Bee Bucks" was also used for the first time. Teachers in the PBIS committee volunteered  their time to work the mobile store and keep inventory of items students enjoyed. In addition, ice cream and a  positive phone call home became popular ways for students to use their Bee Bucks. During SLT and PTA meetings  progress was shared on the implementation of the PBIS program to support families understanding and awareness of  the program.      For the 2018-2019 school year we are looking to continue to deepen the use of PBIS program by continuing to  encourage staff members to use their Bee Bucks when students are desrving of them. We also will work towards  promoting students to run the mobile PBIS store on their own to instill responsiblility and accountability.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Strategies and activities used to attract high-quality highly qualified teachers to our school include:   · Frequent communication with our Borough Field Support Center HR Director when vacancies occur   · Our administrative staff regularly participates in hiring fairs   · Participating in Central Hiring Fair events where pre-screened HQT candidates are interviewed and recruited.   · Establishing a partnership with Queens College Secondary Education Dept. in supporting the grooming of student  teachers in search of the finest level of teaching performance.   · Interviewing HQT candidates from The Open Market Hiring System and The Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) Pool   · Establishing a rigorous interview protocol that includes intensive criteria for the selection of new staff members  including demonstration lessons, interviews, and New York State certification/licensing.   · Instruction by highly qualified staff will take a data-driven approach to improving teaching practice through the use  of a formative rubric so that teachers, especially new teachers, can be provided with professional development  support and/or a teacher mentor to improve student performance.   · Teachers will be assessed in their instructional pedagogy through periodic walkthroughs that provide teachers with  timely feedback which enables them to become highly effective teachers.   · Maintaining a teacher resource center and professional library supported by the English Language Arts Assistant  Principal to promote promising and effective practices.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      · Engage teachers in focused professional study groups based on current professional literature to support  implementation of best practices such as the teaching reading and writing in Social Studies and Science.   · Teachers will be provided with curriculum maps, instructional resources and professional learning resources from  ASCD.   · Individualized PD plans are created for teachers to ensure continued improvement.  Targeted teachers attend specific workshops designed by BFSC content specialists to ensure effective teaching.   · Monthly New Teacher Meetings and Professional development sessions to discuss topics that assist with  instructional expectations of our school as well as administrative functions.   In the very rare event, if a teacher’s status was deemed not HQT, the principal would consult with the BFO Human  Resources Director for guidance to ensure that the non-HQT teacher will meet all required documentation and  assessment deadlines. This may include some form of counseling including encouraging the teacher to become HQT  by applying through the High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation (HOUSSE) system.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our school developed a comprehensive professional development plan that addresses CCLS, the Advance Framework  and our instructional focus and school-wide goals. Professional development opportunities are also differentiated  based on the needs of groups of teachers and individual teachers. Our high quality professional development will  include but not be limited to the following:        Department Meetings – Professional development is provided once a month for teachers within the same   content area (department) to discuss department goals, instructional practices and student performance  trends.     The Principal will facilitate Bi-weekly Cabinet Meetings - The Cabinet Team (principal and assistant   principals) meets twice a week to discuss school data, assess and evaluate instructional programs, and plan  next steps for building the capacity of teachers to better meet the needs of their students.     Professional Development is provided by consultants from Association for Supervision and Curriculum   Development (ASCD) and Brienza Associates for differentiation, use of data, scaffolds, and Universal Design  for Learning (UDL). Lead content area teachers and administrators facilitate in-house professional  development workshops that are specific to the departmental goals, including the use of Academic  Databases, as well as deepening and developing the work in differentiation, use of data, scaffolds, and  Universal Design for Learning (UDL).     District 24 and the Borough Field Support Center provide professional development opportunities regarding   CCLS and The Advance Framework for Teaching scheduled during the school year, which support the  instructional initiatives of the school. Follow up training will continue throughout the year.     Professional Learning Committee meetings will:   o  Analyze student data (NYS ELA Exam, NYS MATH Exam, etc.) and identify areas of need.  o  Understand and adjust support systems for target population(s).  o  Analyze classroom-level student work, in relation to the skill of focus.  o  Review student performance/achievement outcomes.  o  Conduct assessment item analysis and develop additional diagnostic assessments as needed.  o  Analyze and compare curricular materials.  o  Research and implement teaching practices for target population.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35         o  Assist with professional development offerings.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Not Applicable        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Each content area works in professional development sessions as well as curriculum writing sessions to incorporate  assessment strategies. While teachers work together in creating these assessments, they also monitor it's  effectiveness throughout the year by comparing to the New State Standards to ensure integrity. In addition, in the fall  of 2017 we will use our MOSL committee to evaluate the current assessments available to use for the 2017-2018  school year.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. I.S. 73 Frank Sansivieri Intermediate School, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   I.S. 73 Frank Sansivieri Intermediate School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing training, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability system,  student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide give input;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student's academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter and web publication designed to keep parents informed about  school activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.

We  open the program to all English Language Learners at all proficiency levels in sixth, seventh, and  eighth grade and then group them accordingly and plan targeted instruction to meet their various  language needs. We use a combination of the RLAT, EDAT, and teacher input to place students  in classes.    Over the years, we have found that students who attend our Title III programs improve by one to  two levels as evidenced by the RLAT and the EDAT.  Our September 2018 RLAT and EDAT  showed the following data (this will be inputted once results are in as we start the 2018-2019  school year):    Students are informed about our Title III program via their ENL provider. They are provided  with a detailed Title III application that outlines the starting dates and time. This application is  available in English, Spanish, and Chinese. We do translate this application into other languages  as needed. Additionally, we send out a message via our School Messenger robo call system,  which interprets the message in the parents’ preferred language.    We plan to start our AM program on Tuesday, October 23rd 2018 and it will run until Thursday,  May 2nd 2019. The AM program will meet Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 7:00- 8:00 a.m. for a total of three hours per week.  The program will meet approximately 70 times for  a total of 70 hours. We have noticed that in recent years our morning class has no more than  twenty students. This small cohort of mixed levels, enables the ENL provider to pay individual  attention to the different academic and language needs of the students.      The tentative start date for our afternoon program is Wednesday, October 24th 2018 and it will  run until May 2nd 2019, as well.  The afternoon program will meet Wednesdays and Thursdays  from 2:20-4:00 pm. The program will meet approximately 47 times for a total of approximately  71 hours. We plan to have three to four afternoon classes but the final number of classes is based  on the number of students who sign up for the afterschool program. Just like the AM program,  we try to keep the afternoon classes at no more than 20-22 students.  Our morning and afternoon  programs are both conducted under the supervision of an administrator.    The language of instruction for both the morning and afternoon program is English as the goal of  the program is to help students increase English proficiency, however, we do provide native  language support by giving students translation dictionaries in their home language. Teachers use  the students’ native languages to assist them in learning English by increasing awareness of  cognates, encouraging translation of texts and providing native language books in the classroom  library. All classes will be taught by an ENL teacher or a dually certified teacher.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   This year we plan to support the focus our supplemental program with the following instructional  materials:        Our Saturday class will be part of the Saturday Academy that we have been implementing for the  past several years.

At I.S. 73 we  know that parents play a crucial role in their children’s lives and we want to ensure that we  nurture our relationship with families so we can work collaboratively to improve students’  academic, social and emotional experiences at I.S.73.  Parents of our ELLs have different needs,  so every year we are trying to improve the support that we have in place for our students’ parents  as their needs change.  For example, the needs of parents who recently moved to the country may  be different from those who have lived here for a few years. To ensure that we are creating  meaningful and relevant classes and workshops for the parents of our ELLs, we will continue to  administer a survey at the beginning of the school year to gauge interest and need, as well as to  determine what time of the day they would be available to attend school workshops. This is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    meant to ensure that we create workshops that not only meet parents’ needs but address their  availability, so that these sessions are provided at a time that works for them.  Since our Saturday Academy has proven to be successful, we plan to continue to offer an  English, Math, and Technology class for parents of ELLs. This year, parents expressed interest in  having a weekday class as well, so for the 2018-2019 school year, we plan to survey our  students’ parents to determine how many parents would be interested in attending a weekday  class. If we have enough interest, we will open a two-hour class during the week. Furthermore, if  there is enough interest, we also plan to open a GED class for parents of ELLs. All of these  classes, including the GED class for parents, will be a benefit for our community as it brings us  one step closer to increasing literacy among parents.  Communicating all of these programs and resources to parents is important. We send out a flyer  in several different languages, with a description of the program being offered. The notice  contains detailed information such as name of the program, dates the program will run, and time  the program will meet. Furthermore, this information is also printed on the monthly newsletter  and PTA calendar which goes out to families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our first step in assessing literacy skills will be to administer i-Ready, to determine Lexile level and to identify students who are  reading below grade level.   I-Ready is a single K-12 adaptive Diagnostic for Reading and Mathematics which identifies student  needs down to very specific sub-skills.  The program also offers progress monitoring and predicive assessments for end of the  year targets.  This data will facilitate appropriate differentiated instruction to develop literacy skills and enable us to determine  which students receive the Achieve 3000 program, the Rosetta Stone Language Learning  program, the Myon program or the  MindPlay Intervention program. For each unit of study in all content ESL classes , students are given a pre-assessment to  determine their proficiency regarding specific literacy skills that are addressed within the unit of study.  Teachers use this data  to create  Tier 1 instruction and Tier 2 interventions for students. The data is tracked throughout each unit of study so teachers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      know how their students are progressing and can facilitate goal-setting for each unit. At the end of each unit of study in each  content area, ELLs also take a post-assessment so we can track how they have progressed with specific skills throughout our  units of study.     The Schoolcity Assessment Data System is utilized to create reports which enable teacher teams to analyze student results by  subgroup to gauge proficiency with specific skills. This data is utilized by teachers as well as the school's instructional teams to  determine next steps in addressing the academic needs of students.  Analysis of this data enables us to identify trends across  specific grade levels regarding vocabulary development, content knowledge and literacy skills.  The data we attain provides us  with insight into how our ELLs are progressing in comparison to the general education population, which helps us  determine  how much closer we are to closing the achievement gap between the two subgroups.  This data provides teachers with  information regarding the instructional needs of their students and teacher teams work collaboratively to develop and  implement strategies to address those needs. In addition to our pre and post-assessments, which provide us with quantitative  data, students also have a portfolio folder for each content area. In ENL/ELA, Science, and Social Studies, students are provided  with instructional support so that they complete an Initial, Interim, and Final writing assessment in each content area. Each  writing piece leads to the next one. For the 2017-2018 school year we planning to modify some of the Science writing pieces to  make them more STEM related.  For the 2017-2018 school year, we plan to give our English Language Learners the Fall 2017 ELL Periodic Assessment. This  assessment will provide students with practice for the NYSESLAT and most importantly, will provide teachers with quantitative  data that will be used to guide their instruction.  .     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to make sure that teachers provide students with the pre and post assessments, we make sure that all teachers have  enough copies of each assessment as well as the answer sheets. This helps to ensure that all students are given these  assessments on time. Enough time is built in for the teacher to complete the units of study and then give the post-assessment  at the end. Teachers will then be given time in our department meetings to discuss the data and formulate next steps for their  students. Special permission is granted for extension of the units of study when teachers of Entering and Emerging ELLs need  more time.    For the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school year, teachers will also be provided with time to analyze the results of the Fall ELL  Periodic Assessment and to create targeted instruction based on the found data.  Along with this, we will continue to train our  new teachers in utilizing various forms of assessment to create targeted instruction comprised of Tier 1 and Tier 2  interventions.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  All four major content areas administer pre and post unit assessments, unit writing tasks, and other formative  assessments.  Teachers as well as the school's instructional team analyze student results across various subgroups and  compare them to the progress made by students who are not ELLs.  The school uses the following assessments to inform  instruction:  Content Area Unit Pre/Post Assessments, Unit Writing Pieces, Achieve 3000 benchmark assessments, the ELL  Periodic Assessments, and I-Ready data. The data from these assessments provides the school community with the ability to  track and monitor ELL students' progress throughout the year.  Since we will administer the Fall ELL Period Assessment, we will  then also administer the Spring ELL Periodic Assessment to measure growth throughout the year and to provide teachers with  another data source  besides the NYSESLAT.     Since we are officially starting our Sixth Grade Spanish Dual Language Program in September 2017, we will utilize the Spanish  Periodic Assessment for students in that program. Our plan is to administer it in the Fall and Spring to measure growth.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Data from these assessments is also analyzed in teacher teams in order to plan appropriate scaffolds, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3  interventions. Additionally, every year we start off the academic school year with careful analysis of the NYSESLAT to continue   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         to track student growth and to plan instruction accordingly. For the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years, all content area  teachers, will analyze the NYSESLAT data in teacher teams to identify trends which enable teachers to target and provide  instructions for our ELLs.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Response to intervention has been very important to I.S.73 over the last few years. Our teachers provide Tier 1 intervention in  the classroom every day in every content area. In order to accomplish this, all of our teachers have been provided with  professional development that focuses on using assessment in their instruction. At I.S. 73, we believe that if students are  provided with different entry points into the content, they will be more successful in mastering the standards.  Along with our  Tier 1 intervention, all content teachers continue to analyze data carefully and then create small group conferences which are  our Tier 2 interventions. The goal for next year is to make Tier 2 interventions more targetted and teachers will be expected  to  document the interventions throughout the school year. Finally Tier 3 interventions will be provided in very small groups or  individually based on student needs.      For the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years, we will continue to use some of the programs that we have already been using  along with iReady. The following is a list of programs that we will continue to use for Response to Intervention.        1.  Achieve 3000 program is an online reading program for students which begins with an initial level set assessment to  gauge Lexile level and offers a range of informational articles at varying levels of text complexity to match the students’ Lexile  levels as they change throughout the year.      2.    Rosetta Stone Online Language Learning for Beginners offers students  practice in  all four modalities through an on-line language classroom. The program continually assesses and differentiates the  content based on students’ performance.       3.  MindPlay reading program for SWD-ELLs is an on-line literacy program  which focuses on the five pillars of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Students  begin with a pre-assessment which gives           individual student data about progress within each of the five pillars  mentioned above.         4.  myON provides unlimited access to a library of more than 8,000 enhanced digital  books with  multimedia supports, real-time reporting, assessments and embedded close reading tools. This digital literacy platform allows  students not only engage in close reading with digital texts, but also to select texts based on interest.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use a variety of assessments such as the NYSESLAT, New York State ELA and Math assessments, and ELL Periodic  Assessments to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  I.S.73 is always diligently working to close the achievement gap and  these assessments are always a starting point to to begin the conversations about  how our ELLs are doing when compared to  non ELLs.     We also plan to run the EDAT tool as early as late August if all the ATS reports are available to begin to target students in need  of Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention and to analyze how our ELLs are doing in relation to our non-ells. More information will be  provided as soon as the 2017-2018 EDAT is up.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  The school administration meets 1-2 times a week to discuss and identify trends among ELLs in relation to our other  subgroups. These meetings take place throughout the school year and as as team the administration makes informed decisions  about the curriculum for ELLs. Teachers are part of these collaborative discussions in their department meetings as well which  take place every Monday. They also meet weekly during common planning to discuss trends.           Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our current program is in compliance with CR Part 154.2 and meets the requirements for all five English Proficiency  levels in ENL classes, including integrated and standalone language support.  Our Entering students receive a  minimum of 180 minutes of ENL by a certified ESL teacher and our Emerging students receive at least 90  minutes.  Our Entering students receive a minimum of 180 minutes of integrated instruction in ELA, Emerging  students receive a minimum of 180 minutes in ELA and 90 additional minutes in either ENL or ELA , Transitioning  students receive a minimum of 90 minutes of integrated instruction in ELA and another 90 minutes in either ENL or  ELA. Our expanding students  receive a minimum of 180 minutes either in ELA or another content area.  Most of our  English Language Learners and Commanding students are actually over serviced because many of them are taught by  dually certified teachers.  Students travel together as a group and the students who are at the Entering and Emerging  Proficiency levels are predominantly grouped homogeneously. Transitioning  students are grouped homogeneously.  Students at the Expanding Proficiency Level are mixed with General Education English native students and  Commanding students when appropriate.   The students with disabilities in ICT/ self-contained classes are grouped  heterogeneously.   .    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We currently do not have a TBE program./A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      In September 2017, we will begin our first Sixth Grade Spanish Dual Language Program. The goal of our program is to  promote biliteracy in both English and Spanish in the four content areas as well as in Home Language Arts. We intend  for half of the class to be Transitioning and Expanding ELLs and the other half to be non ELLs. Right now, we are  working diligently to make sure that we have fully certified teachers and our goal is that students will receive  instruction in Spanish half of the time in Math, Science, and Social studies in addition to Home Language Arts. Doing  this will ensure that we are in full compliance.  Students will travel together as a group from class to class.  N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?             Compliance has always been important to our ENL department which is evident in the monthly compliance reports that  we receive from Queens North. The first step we take to decide which students will receive standalone ENL the following  school year is to analyze trends in the NYSESLAT  among our student body. We make an informed decision as to where we will  place students for the following school year and of course we make changes when and where it is necessary. Our ENL assistant  principal along with the ENL Coordinator work collaboratively to generate an Excel document which indicates which classes  will receive mandated standalone ENL services. When creating the master program, we make sure that these students are  placed in the classes that receive standalone ENL. Special circumstances of when we create a pull-out ENL program for a  student may be when a child gets evaluated for special education services and the child goes to an ICT class that does not  receive standalone ENL. In addition, we are also providing services in excess of CR Part 154 mandated time frames for all  levels, including our commanding ELLs, who receive two additional years of ENL support. To ensure that students receive the  correct number of integrated ENL in ENL or another subject area we try as much as possible to give those classes to our dually  certified teachers and when an ELA or other content teacher is not dually certified we then have one of our ESL teachers push- in to a content area for at least 180 minutes a week. Next year, students in our new Spanish Dual Language Program will also  receive 4-5 periods of Home Language Arts by a certified LOTE teacher.  .     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All ELA classes for Entering and Emerging ELLs are taught by dually licensed ELA/ESL teachers and all ELLs receive their  mandated ENL periods with licensed ESL teachers.  All ELA teachers have been trained to use ELL strategies for their ENL  students as well as their commanding students.  Scaffolded lessons are used daily to ensure academic growth.  Specific  strategies used in our ELA classes to engage students and ensure growth are: chunking of texts, color-coding complex texts for  easier navigation and increased comprehension. ELA and ESL teachers also target and scaffold vocabulary instruction, and  employ various Q-TEL strategies such as double entry journals, mind mirrors, Think-Pair-Share and anticipatory guides.  Additionally, discussion prompts and various levels of questioning are implemented to effectively engage students in  collaborative discussions.  ESL teachers continue to implement the use of language and content objectives which are aligned to  skills and content objectives for the ELA units of study. These language objectives are designed to enable English Language  Learners to choose language which expresses ideas precisely and concisely, along with sentence frames for writing and  discussion. Furthermore, our teachers have received professional development by ASCD instructors in the areas of  differentiated instruction, Universal Design for Learning and scaffolding vocabulary.  Practices learned in professional  development are then implemented in the classroom. This year we will train ESL teachers in Collaborative Strategic Reading to  develop students’ ability to navigate, annotate and discuss complex texts. All ELLs will have access to I-Pads. I-pads will be used  to build and expand on vocabulary as well as to help students translate complex texts to their native language when necessary.  In addition, ELLs have access to content specific glossaries which are provided in multiple languages for Mathematics, Science  and Social Studies.     In Social Studies, English Language Learners are presented with the content through various modalities which are scaffolded in  order to assist them in understanding. For example, trade books, political cartoons, primary and secondary sources, maps and  charts from the past show what the world was like in a different time period. Students learn the content through written  documents such newspapers, magazines, letters, diaries, speeches.    In Science, students are interacting with the NYS Intermediate Science curriculum through increased scientific experiments and  STEM activities. ELLs are encouraged to develop academic language through tasks of inquiry and investigation. Teachers  support students with the integration of key strategies including text chunking and increased visuals for vocabulary support.    Both Social Studies and Science teachers provide academic support through the use of graphic organizers such as Frayer  Models, Concept Maps, Venn Diagrams, and Double Entry Journals as well as by providing translations in students' native  language when possible.  In order to make this possible, Science and Social Studies teachers have been trained in academic  content vocabulary strategies such as Vocabulary Warms, K-W-L- (Building Background Knowledge), picture representations,  and color coding.    In Math, teachers embrace explicit teaching strategies that focus on modeling specific skills for our students. In our ENL  program, teachers use content glossaries and translation dictionaries to provide students with support in their home language.  To support our students academically, teachers use the CUBES strategy and model circling the numbers, underlining the  question, box out key terms, and evaluate and solve the problem. Entering and Emerging students are also provided with  scaffolded/annotated texts as well as the original texts.  Additionally, Math teachers in our ENL program make it a priority to  pronounce key term so students can repeat after them.  They also provide students with short videos, visuals, and graphic  organizers such as the Frayer diagram in child friendly language as well as in students' home language.  We also just bought Go Math consumable textbooks in Spanish for our new Sixth Grade Dual Language Program.  Next year we plan to focus on the part of speech for Math terminology as well as using cognates, and accountable talk  prompts with sentence starters to build on academic Math discussions so students can defend their claim and critique  someone else's work. Content vocabulary is present on Word Walls which are organized by unit of study.  .       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58        All ELLs and commanding students are provided with translation glossaries to use during class time and for all  assessments.  Students in the Sixth Grade Dual Language Program will be provided with the Fall Spanish Periodic Assessment  as well as the Spring one to measure growth. We are also researching other ways that we can assess ELL in their home  language..     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At I.S.73, differentiating instruction for all student is imperative, especially for our English Language Learners and its different  subgroups is imperative.  a.  SIFEAfter doing a thorough interview with the legal guardian and student, we administer the SIFE questionnaire in the  student's home language. This information along with the Spanish LAB score, if the student is Spanish speaking, helps us to  make an informed decision about whether the student has experienced interruption in their formal education.  Our teachers  continue to have leveled libraries in their classrooms, which span levels from below to above the competency levels of these  students.  Using leveled libraries in the classroom provides students with the flexibility and freedom they need to read books  that are on their current level. Many of these libraries are dual language, so that they may have the literature in their native  language as well.  We have provided SIFE with special newcomer kits, as well as phonics labs to enhance literacy  skills.  Classroom grouping will provide for differentiation of instruction so that the teacher may focus on the specific skills  targeted for improvement.      All ESL teachers and content area teachers have been trained in using reading strategies in all content areas, as well as using  data to scaffold instruction for our ELA and ESL classes. Every year we strive to train new teachers as well. Continuous  professional development is very important at our school as we know this is one of the most crucial ways for teachers to  reflect on and improve their instruction.  We are trying to determine how best to assess students in their native language This  type of assessment will allow us to measure students native language abilities in comparison to their English proficiency. Since  these students present special challenges,  they must be socialized as well as educated.  We encourage these students to  participate in our Title III program, where they receive additional support.   Other interventions we have in place are small- group instruction, ENL enrichment periods filtered into the school program, and, wherever possible, Achieve 3000 is offered to  ENL students.  We support the teachers of SIFE with professional development, curriculum development meetings, and  teacher team meetings.  During these meetings, teachers are presented with strategies that will help these students achieve  their utmost potential.    b. NewcomersOur newcomer students are placed in a class according to their proficiency level as will be determined by the  NYSESLAT scores or by the NYSITELL.  For the last few years we have provided newcomers who register in September with a  Newcomer's class to help them transition academically, emotionally, and culturally.  Toward the end of the program and  afterwards, these students will receive the Rosetta Stone language program. Newcomers are also introduced to graphic novels  that are aligned to our units of study  as well as texts in their native language.  We have also used one of the newcomer  curriculum units offered by DELLSS with one group at start the school year.  Once we analyze the data for the incoming ENL  students, wewill determine which of those AIR units we will use.  c.  Developing Our 4 - 6 year ELLs are held to the same  rigorous expectations as their English-speaking counterparts.  This year, to support their needs as ELLs who, based upon  individual data analysis, still require focused instruction in reading and writing,  We will provide them with "Achieve 3000" in  order to assist them in developing these skills.  This year we plan to go global with the use of content and language objectives,  therefore, any teacher of ELLs in all content areas will be trained on utilizing content and language objectives.  d. Long-Term ELLsData has shown us that most of our long-terms ells have not tested out since elementary school. We  encourage this subgroup to attend our advanced  Title III program which places special emphasis on literacy and math skills to  help long-term ELLs succeed.  In this program, we not only focus on literacy skills, but we also provide intensive work on  language development through the content areas.  We will continue to utilize MindPlay to address students’ reading  deficiencies so they can master complex texts in the classroom. Parents will be notified and encouraged to attend a workshop  where the benefits of MindPlay as well as Achieve3000 will be explained.  We also encourage our long term ELLs to attend our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      after school ELA and Math programs, which are available to English Proficient students. e. Former ELLs up to two years after  exiting ELL status  We will continue to service our commanding students for two years after they have tested out. This support  will take place in the form of integrated ENL in ELA or another content area.   Although these students have reached  proficiency, we will continue to monitor their progress and make sure that we help them transition by providing them with  time and a half on the state assessments and with a glossary in their native language as well.  We plan to provide our  commanding students with Achieve 3000 instruction so they continue to make progress. .      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All SWD-ELLs will have access to an I-Pad and Chromebooks which will be used to access necessary background information  and support for all content areas. All SWD-ELLs are programmed to receive Achieve 3000. SWD-ELLs who demonstrate  deficiency in decoding skills are given the Mindplay or the Myon program. Teachers of SWD-ELLs have received professional  development in creating scaffolds for questions, chunking of texts, using sentence starters and paragraph frames, Universal  Design for Learning principles, and QTEL strategies: Think-Pair-Share, Anticipatory sets.  In addition, video clips, graphic novels  and strategies for vocabulary development are incorporated into our units of study. We will continue to use discussion stems  and the 4Ls strategy with all ELLs including SWD-ELLs..     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     One of our goals this year is to make sure that students are always placed within the least-restrictive environment and in order  to achieve this we try to do flexible programming as much as possible. Our school culture is gradually shifting so that we help  students move from Special Classes to ICT, and ICT to SETSS, and SETSS to general education whenever possible.    ELL-SWDs are encouraged to use different programs such as Achieve3000, MYON, and MindPlay based on their needs so they  can continue to make progress towards their IEP goals.  The co teaching model is in place to ensure that students receive the  maximum educational benefit of the expertise of the content area teacher along with the special education provider and the  ESL teacher.  Individualized Educational Plans (IEP) are strictly adhered to.  Classes are paralleled to ensure that students  whose IEP requires them to move throughout the special education continuum can do so. ENL teachers, read each student’s  IEP carefully and are aware of upcoming annual meetings. This allows teachers to know when IEP goals have changed and how  they need to reflect on their teacher practices to help students meet their goals. .        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention is very important at I.S.73 as we understand that intervention is key in preventing students from being  evaluated and receiving special education services.    This upcoming school year, students will be tested using IReady which will help us determine Lexile levels. Once the initial  assessment is completed, students who demonstrate deficiency in fluency, decoding  and vocabulary (below 3rd grade level  proficiency) will utilize the Mindplay program (see below). Students who have deficiencies in comprehension and vocabulary  (at 4th grade level or above) will utilize the Myon reading program and/or  Achieve 3000. I-Ready also provides students with  intervention and development activities.-                Mindplay is an on-line literacy program which focuses on the five pillars of  reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Students begin with a pre-assessment which  gives individual student data about progress within each of the five pillars mentioned above.  -                Myon provides  unlimited access to a library of more than 8,000 enhanced digital  books with multimedia supports, real-time reporting and  assessments and embedded close reading tools. This digital literacy platform allows students not only to read closely, but to to  engage with digital texts based on their interests.-                Achieve 3000 is an online reading program for students which  begins with an initial level set assessment to place students at appropriate text levels and offers a range of informational  articles at varying levels of text complexity to match the students’ Lexile levels as they change throughout the year. Our ELLs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      benefit by engaging in several steps with each article:Polling/ Pre-reading question, vocabulary instruction, reading activity,  and a short multiple choice quiz to gauge comprehension of the text, a thought question/ writing response, and extension  activities to support literacy skills. Teachers can measure growth on a regular basis as students’ Lexile levels  increase.-               Rosetta Stone Language Learning Program- Offers students practice in all four modalities through an on-line  language classroom. The program continually assesses and differentiates the content based on students’ performance. The  program offers a range of components: grammar, vocabulary, speaking, listening, reading and writing. Teachers have access to  data reports from the program to identify areas of need for Beginner ELLs. Teachers can select the interface language in  Rosetta Stone, so that directions are given in students’ native language.-               We provide word-to-word glossaries as well in  our ELL content area classrooms. ELLs will have access to I-Pads. The I-Pads serve in many capacities: translation, educational  apps, access to digital subscriptions and the opportunity to build vital background knowledge in the content areas.-               In  the social studies department, we have programmed whole- class as well as small group instructional support for our English  Language Learners.  There is a literacy component in our instruction which bridges all content area subjects.  We want our ELLs  to use native language to support their learning.  Therefore, we allow them to carry electronic translators, picture dictionaries  and regular dictionaries.  When students enter from other countries, we pair them with students within their classes in the  same language group so that they can assimilate to the school setting.  We also maintain a list of which staff members can  provide translation assistance in various languages.  When we require translation services, either for administrative purposes,  or for the students, we can call upon them utilizing this list.   Additionally,  our ENL students have received the NYS Social  Studies Glossary to use for their assignments, homework and assessments in Social Studies. -               Science teachers provide  in- class interventions through small group instruction during class periods. ENL students in need of additional support are  identified through unit exams, in class assessments and teacher observations. Science teachers communicate with ELA, ENL  and other content area teachers to collaborate about the interventions that are needed for each student. Science teachers  utilize small group instruction time to review reading passages from the Mini Lesson, reinforce key vocabulary terms for the  unit or review video clips which detail the content objective for the day’s lesson. The school plans to utilize Brainpop as a way  to support students and parents in the understanding of science content and to further develop the academic language skills  of our students. In class, scaffolds are provided for our ENL students in need of support through teacher- created materials  which provide systematic and explicit instruction for classroom activities or experiments. Steps are broken down into  manageable chunks and instructions are written to encourage students to better understand the routines of the  classroom/lesson/activity.-               IReady is a web based program that covers all aspects of mathematics.  It responds to the  students’ strengths and weaknesses, creating a personalized learning pathway for each student with custom course content  and assignments.  Activities engage and support students through the use of visual representations and guided  tutorials.  Students will have access to this program 24 hours a day so they can access the materials at home or at school.               9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The following improvements and programs will be included for the 2017-2018 school year.-               IReady will be used to  determine lexile levels and provide targeted intervention-               use of i-Pads for all ELLs as well as  Chromebooks-               Continue our implementation of Collaborative Strategic Reading-               Revision of ELA curriculum by  ENL teacher team, -               New Sixth Grade Spanish Dual Language Program  -               ENL teachers push-in to content area  classes where the program/ schedule permits.-               Continue with a title III ENL class in the Saturday Academy-                A  newcomer program will continue to be conducted to help newcomers develop an understanding of our school  systems and  culture     In Math, IReady will be utilized which is a web based program that covers all aspects of mathematics. It responds to the  students’ strengths and weaknesses, creating a personalized learning pathway for each student with custom course content  and assignments.  Activities engage and support students through the use of visual representations and guided  tutorials.                   10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A               11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All English Language Learners are afforded equal access to school programs by being invited to our different programs and  events throughout the school year. Students are invited to our Saturday Academy as well as school clubs such as Drama,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Debate, Robotics, and chess.  They are also invited to attend the PSAL basketball team as well as the CHAMPS Sports  Program.  To ensure ELLs understand the information in flyers and permission slips, we translate them into several languages.  We offer Title III Morning, After school and Saturday Programs, where ELLs can develop English skills in reading, writing,  listening, and speaking. Entering level students are offered the Rosetta Stone Program to foster English language acquisition.  Advisory teachers read all letters to homeroom classes to encourage participation in extra curricular programs. In addition,  teachers of the Arts do presentations during assemblies to encourage all students to join the Band and Art clubs. Additionally,  eighth grade ELLs are encouraged to take the test-prep courses with the goal of registering to take the Specialized High School  exam.  .     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Units of Study developed AIR and the DELLSS for Newcomer/Entering ELLs will be incorporated into our program. ELLs will  have access to I-Pads, laptops, and Chromebooks. The IPads serve in many capacities: translation, educational apps, access to  digital subscriptions and the opportunity to build vital background knowledge in the content areas. We will purchase digital  subscriptions to Cricket Magazine and Scholastic Scope Magazine to support ELA curriculum and build background for Social  Studies content, providing access to authentic, complex texts. We also have access to Flocabulary, which students can use in  school or at home to review concepts and broaden vocabulary. Graphic novels are used to support many texts in the ELA  curriculum. We have native language reading materials the school library as well as in ENL classroom libraries. We are  currently ordering additional Home Language materials and resources to support our new home language class. Native  language glossaries are provided for all ELLs in their content area classes.          .               13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered as follows: I-pads for translation as well as content-specific translation glossaries created  by the New York State Education Department are offered to all ELLs.  We also translate documents from content areas/ classes  into Spanish and Chinese whenever possible. In our new Dual Language Program, we plan to provide instruction in Spanish  50% of the time. .     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   At I.S.73 we have a standards aligned curriculum that teachers with the support of coaches and the administration have  created. Although students learn the same units of study, the units are differentiated to provide access to all students  regardless of their entry point.    In order to avoid repetition of material taught in earlier grades, teachers pay close attention to the standards guiding their  lessons. In teacher team meetings, teachers choose texts carefully that are appropriate not just in complexity but in interest as  well. This year we have started the school year by having students take a diagnostic exam in IReady in English Language Arts  and Math. This data will be used to create more targeted instruction and intervention for our ELLs.    Additionally, when we are registering English Language Learners for the first time, we make sure to do a thorough interview so  we can learn about the student's prior academic experience. This will help us better understand in order to properly place the  student in a class that will meet his/her needs after the NYSITELL has been given.    Every student receives required services as mandated by CR Part 154, providing support for all levels of proficiency in ELA, ENL  and content areas where applicable. All students receive access to the same curriculum. All texts in all content areas are at  students' grade level.  Access and support to the texts and other materials are scaffolded by chunking, filtering vocabulary and  guided questioning which are used to increase comprehension.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share a building with another school.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   New entrants are invited to a school orientation so they can transition to our school. This orientation helps students navigate  our building and facilitates a smooth transition to the start of the school year in September. New ELLs New entrants are invited  to a school orientation so they can transition to our school. This orientation helps students navigate our building and facilitates  a smooth transition to the start of the school year in September. New ELLs who are enrolled throughout the school year also  receive an individualized orientation by our ELL Coordinator. During this orientation students learn about the school and meet  all of their new teachers. Additionally, we have a Newcomer's class that meets twice a week as previously mentioned.who are  enrolled throughout the school year also receive an individualized orientation by our ELL Coordinator. During this orientation  students learn about the school and meet all of their new teachers. Additionally, we have a Newcomer's class that meets twice  a week as previously mentioned.    .         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Our Foreign Language department has been growing over the last few years with Spanish being the lanauge offered.       .                 18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We will begin our first Sixth Grade Spanish Dual Language Program this coming September and we are  working diligently to be in full compliance.  a. We plan to have a self-contained dual language program composed of ELLs and non-ELLs. We intend to  have proficient English and Spanish speaking teachers for Math, Science, Social Studies and Home  Language Arts with the goal of providing students with 50% of instruction in English and 50% in Spanish  with the exception of HLA which will be only in Spanish.  b. We plan for Math, Science, and Social Studies to be taught in both English and Spanish and HLA will be  given solely in Spanish.  c.  We intend to choose which periods the content classes will be taught in English and which will be  taught in Spanish. We also plan to use the color red for Spanish materials and blue for English ones.  d. Both languages will be taught simultaneously.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Every year we review our professional development sessions and have collaborative conversations about how PD can be  improved to impact student achievement even more. We started moving in the direction of not just training teachers on  cultural awareness, but also on how to create culturally responsive classrooms which can lead them to have culturally  responsive relationships with their students.    We will continue to train all teachers of ELLs across the content areas as well as any new teachers in:  Universal Design for Learning Principles   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         Text Chunking  Vocabulary strategies for ELLs    We are aiming to do this in September and October    We will also revisit QTEL strategies with ELL teachers across the content areas (Double-entry journal, Anticipatory Sets, Think- Pair-Share and Mind Mirror). We will continue to provide training on the best practices for oral language development as  outlined in a brief from the Department of English Language Learners Support Services. We will also conduct ongoing  professional development to support all teachers of ELLs in data analysis for new assessments as well as designing appropriate  scaffolds and interventions.    Other professional development sessions that we are planning to conduct for all new teachers and content teachers who  haven't received training are:    Using content and language objectives with our ELLs  Creating Culturally Responsive classrooms  Creating Culturally Responsive Relationships  Learning Disability vs. Language Acquisition  Collaborative Team Teaching for English Language Learners IReady- Questioning and Discussion Techniques Part I for New  Teachers- Questioning and Discussion Techniques Part II for New Teachers-EDAT analysis- Understanding the NYSESLAT for All  Teachers- Collaborative Strategic Reading Strategy turnkey presentation for ENL Teachers and Content Area Teachers  of  ELLsAfter the LAP has been approved, we will have a training on understanding the LAP  as an Academy meeting. The goal  of this training is for all teachers to understand how we plan for our ELLs and what systems we have put in place to make sure  that all ELLs are successful.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.     At I.S.73 we are constantly working to assess the needs of students and teachers and provide teachers with professional  development sessions that are relevant to their practice and to the needs of their students.  Because we do this, we stay in  compliance with  15% of PD hours for all teachers and 50% for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific  professional development. See question 1 in this section for specific information regarding our professional development plan.    Every school year we maintain our own compliance binders with a copy of each agenda presented at all meetings and the  original sign in sheets along with any documents/resources given to teachers. To do this, we ensure that all teachers sign the  attendance sheets at all meetings. This year we started to create an Excel document with the titles of some of the key  professional development sessions that we want all teachers to have. We are documenting which teachers receive PDs and  when they receive it so that administrators can plan for and develop teachers based on their individual needs..        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We will continue to conduct individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss progress their child has made in acquiring the  English language. Conversations will focus on goals of our program, language development progress, language proficiency   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64            assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Teachers will use the Tuesday parental engagement  time as well as their prep periods to be fully available for parents.      To promote the annual individual meetings with ELL parents, teachers will send home notices inviting parents to come in  during Tuesday parental engagement time or to choose another date and time that works best for their schedule. Phone calls  will also be made to invite parents in for these vital discussions. Teachers will be expected to keep a log of the times they have  met or spoken with their students’ parents. This log will be specific with student’s name, class, parent’s name, and date and  time the meeting took place. In the event that an interpreter is necessary for the parent, accommodations will be made.    Our ENL Coordinator will also send letters home to the parents of ELLs and commanding students informing them that they  can request a meeting with their teachers at any time they wish to see their child's teachers. The ENL Coordinator will also  make it a point to remind parents that this is a right they have during the monthly ELL parent workshops.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      At the beginning of the school year, our ENL Coordinator will send home a survey with a list of possible topics from which  parents may select workshops. Space will be provided for parents to write down any other workshops they would like.  Some of the workshops we will continue to have are:    a) Orientation and program selection    b) Understanding the NYSESLAT  examination    c) What is required of your child on standardized examinations?    d) How can I support my child at home  academically and emotionally?  These workshops are facilitated by our bilingual ENL Coordinator. We also provide  interpretation services through school personnel, and each meeting is interpreted into the varying home languages of the  parents present.  Wherever necessary, we will utilize the translation services provided by the Department of Education.    All  parents are invited to workshops on an ongoing basis throughout the school year.  These are facilitated by guidance  counselors, our parent coordinator, and teachers as required.  Simultaneous translation services are provided by bilingual staff  as necessary for each specific group.  Those deal with:    a) guiding good choices--a 5-session workshop on drug prevention and  strengthening parental relationships with children.    b) how to read the report card    c) health issues    d) promotion  standards    e) high school application process    f) high school articulation (fairs)    g) meet the teachers school and curricula  orientation night    h) nutrition    i) bullying    j) NYSESLAT orientation for parents of ELLs    k) program selection orientation for  parents of new ELLs     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Casale, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Frank Sansivieri                                                                              School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.         I.S. 73 is a very diverse middle school and because of that we’re always trying our best to meet the language  needs of not just our student population but our students’ parents as well. When the initial registration is done in  our school, we have a trained pedagogue who conducts a detailed interview of the student and specifically asks  the parent in which language they want to be spoken to and in which language they want to receive written  information (last 2 questions of the HLIS). Some of the ATS reports that we use are: RAPL and the RHLA to  research predominant languages among our ELLs. Emergency home contact cards and the school intake form in  the cumulative record card are used as well.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      At the beginning of the school year we send out a survey to our entire staff where we ask them to share with us  any other language they are fluent in or are conversational in besides English. We then maintain a list of all adults  in the building, and in which languages they can communicate. We use this list when we need an interpreter, but  when we need a language that we do not have in the building then we contact the DOE’s Translation Services.  Additionally, when we have parent meetings, we always try to have interpreters available.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     No other language makes 10% of our population.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.

Next year we will send it  to the translation services ahead of  time in order to translate to other  languages.    Parent Coordinator translates to  Spanish before the calendar goes out  to families.    Our ENL, Coordinator translates these  letters and Mr. Xu, translates them to  Chinese.    These letters have been translated by  one of our staff members to Spanish.  We will get them translated into  different languages by using the DOE  Translation Services.    These letters are usually translated by  one of our staff members.    Our ENL Coordinator with Mr. Xu  translate these letters to Spanish and  Chinese.    These letters are usually translated by  one of our staff members.    Our ENL Coordinator with Mr. Xu  translate these letters to Spanish and  Chinese.

The PowerPoint that teachers use is  translated to Spanish. We try to have as  many in school interpreters available  such as paraprofessionals and school  aides, but teachers also have the DOE  interpretation telephone number with  them in case they need to use it.    WE always have a Spanish and Chinese  speaking interpreter. They both use a  headphone device to simultaneously  interpret the meeting.    Depending on the language, they use  someone from the staff. If a staff  member does not know the language  they need, then they use the DOE  interpretation services.    Depending on the language, they use  someone from the staff.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In case of an emergency and we need to reach out to our limited-English proficient families, we use the list of staff  languages that we have and one of our staff members will interpret for us.

This number has been  given to all staff members as well as a way to increase communication with our students’ parents.                Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      At the beginning of the school year, all staff members received a memo with information regarding the DOE’s  Language line-interpretation services. Because it is much faster to access an interpreter now, many of our teachers  have had positive experiences when using this resource. Teachers, however, have not really been able to use the  Translation services as this unit does not translation academic materials.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school maintains copies of the Bill of Parent Rights in all languages in the Parent Coordinator’s Office. We also  ensure that this document is posted in the lobby. Parents will be provided the information they need to access these  documents on the Internet as well, using the DOE website. Additionally, we have a poster when you first enter the  school and in our main office that tells parents to point to the language they need services in. On letters and flyers  sent home regarding meetings, we also write “Translation will be available” so this way all parents feel welcome         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We meet with parents at school functions and PTA meetings, as well as use parent engagement time and parent- teacher conferences to gather feedback from parents. We are in the process of creating a more comprehensive survey  for all of our parents so we know how they feel in regards to translation and interpretation services at our school.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72
