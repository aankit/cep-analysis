This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Schuylerville Preparatory High School educators envision our scholars as cognitive apprentices across all disciplines.  SPHS scholars will use their educational foundation, which is rooted in disciplinary literacy, to foster academic and  personal growth, enabling them to become productive and successful contributing citizens to society. To realize our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      vision, our mission is for educators to engage scholars in rigorous and engaging academic and social experiences;  these experiences are the foundation for success in scholars’ college years and beyond.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    By following the principles of disciplinary literacy, educators provide scholars with opportunities to learn via a  student-centered, inquiry-based model that results in cognitive apprenticeship across all content areas.    In order to better understand our instructional focus of disciplinary literacy as a school community, our educators  worked together to prioritize a power standard—one that our students should master by the end of the school year  across all content areas; this standard is CCLS W.4, which is coherent writing that is task-appropriate. As part of our  mission to create cognitive apprentices through disciplinary literacy, we are aligning our units to sub standards that  are building the foundation for our students ‘success with W.4.       Serving many students from the Westchester Square, Castle Hill, Soundview, and Throggs Neck neighborhoods, our  scholars have a general vested interest in the community. To ensure that scholars who are traveling from non- neighboring sections of the Bronx, we make every effort to engage them with the community through extracurricular  activities, internships, and family events. Through a Lehman Educational Campus effort, we have a school clinic with  Montefiore, which gives our students daily access to a licensed social worker. Moreover, students benefit from  campus-wide initiatives such as AP for All and campus-wide extracurricular clubs and programs.       SPHS is beginning its sixth year as a school; our first graduating class was originally projected to be 27%, but after  several interventions, 67% of our students graduated. Additionally, our Quality Review ratings reflected proficient and  well-developed ratings in all areas, with the exception of 1.2 and 2.2, which received developing ratings. In our 17-18  school year, our graduation rate in June was 77% while our August grad rate improved to 82%.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   SPHS has a diverse population of scholars; we are currently serving 359 students, of which 27% have IEPs and 22% are  ELLs. Both populations often face challenges with transitioning to high school, facing the rigor of Regents-level work,  and accessing complex text, whether due to language acquisition or below-grade-level literacy skills.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school has made the most improvement in 5.1 and 1.3, monitoring and revising and use of resources,  respectively. Specifically, we have utilized resources and school-wide reflective processes to improve our culture of  learning and effective school leadership. Additionally, with our work in improving 5.1, our teachers are more  collaborative, using professional learning cycles to collaboratively engage in inquiry work.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X348   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   376   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        2014-15 Quality Review feedback stated that the school is developing with respect to indicators 1.2 and 2.2; this  feedback was further validated by several visits from our superintendent's team during the 2017-18 school year.  While 82% of students graduated, only 79% of students accumulate 10+ credits in the ninth grade. Moreover, our  average Regents score across all exams ranges from 35-64%, proving that a large number of students are failing  Regents exams. As part of our three-year instructional focus on disciplinary literacy, our sub focus for the 18-19 year is  assessment.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      As a result of improving co-teaching partnerships, there will be a 5% increase on the average score of the Algebra I  Regents Exam, moving from 57% to 62%, by June 2019.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

The School Implementation Team will work closely with the  Instructional Support Team to provide training to all teachers on  how to scaffold, differentiate, and appropriately modify  instruction for all students with IEPs and ELLs.    4. We will develop and implement a Strategic Assessment Plan  that describes effective assessment practices and which  establishes expectations for the use of assessments to monitor  progress, to inform curriculum changes and to adjust  professional learning for teachers of IEP students. This document  will contain a detailed Assessment Calendar including all school- wide common and summative assessments (e.g., midterms and  finals) and will articulate how assessment is aligned to the  school’s goals, the observation cycle and teacher professional  learning.          3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  Families will be invited to curriculum nights and parent engagement meetings once a marking period and once a  week, respectively, throughout the 18-19 school year.

While areas of the principal's instructional leadership and program coherence were positively rated above the city  average, areas of personal attention and support, as well as guidance, were rated below the city average at 54% and  73%, respectively. To address these concerns, we implemented a four-year advisory program that is a hybrid of two  different initiatives: The Question Project and Peer Forward. In grades 9 and 10, students take the Question Project  course, where they explore their identities and purpose; this builds a strong social-emotional foundation for their high  school career and beyond. In grades 11 and 12, but starting in grade 10, students explore the college and career  process through Peer Forward. We also had several faculty and staff trained in TCIS and restorative justice practices.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  As a result of implementing advisory courses and an academically- and socially-enriching after school program, there  will be a 6% increase in the number of students who respond positively to the personal attention and support section  of the school environment survey, moving from 54% to 60%, by June 2018.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   SPHS's recent Quality Review ratings were developing in 4.2. Moreover, the school's systems and structures for  communicating high expectations, ensuring quality programming that is suited to students' individual needs, and  promoting college readiness are growth areas. While the school was rated proficient in 3.4, it is noted that there were  minimal accountability structures in place that would allow administration to reflect upon the work being done in  order to make any data-driven decisions and changes. SPHS did not have a CBO partner prior to the end of the 15-16  years, and there are several students who are disengaged from school, which is evident in attendance and credit  accumulation data. Moreover, school culture, as per the Learning Environment Survey and school-generated surveys  indicate that teachers and staff do not all feel informed and/or part of a community, which indicates a need to build a  stronger culture that values communication.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

SPHS values its parents and their partnership. While the school was rated "proficient" in 3.4, several cohort S and T  students were not receiving notification of at-risk status on a regular basis. Several parents have asked for more  transparency throughout the marking periods in order to support their children with their course work. "Prep Points,"  the monthly memo to all families, contained general information on the school, but parents expect more personalized  information. With a recent transition to Skedula (Pupil Path), parents are able to keep track of student performance,  but also communicate regularly with teachers. To improve parent communication, SPHS now has a new website that  is updated frequently, and every child and their family receive a schuylervilleprephs.org email, which receives regular  updates about things happening "at the Schuy."

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Schuylerville Preparatory High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Schuylerville Preparatory High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Moreover, ELLs in  grades 9 and 10 will receive support in Algebra I and Living Environment. ELLs in grades 11  and 12 will receive help in academic language, geometry, chemistry and college awareness. The  students will be attending two college fairs. We will also be using College Goal NY and  participating in college application week.    Flexible grouping of the students will be used in order to maximize the amount of support for the  duration of the program. Students will be placed into one of two groups by grade level and the  academic needs assessed with the NYSESLAT and their transcripts. A licensed pedagogue will  teach each of these groups. One teacher is certified in mathematics; one teacher is dual  certified in ENL and ELA.    The language of instruction is English, however, students will be encouraged to use native- language supports and scaffolds; materials such as translated texts, native-English language  dictionaries, and visual supports will be used. Novels, previous regents exams, Duolingo,  Babylon, and Barron’s materials are some of the materials that will be used for instruction. This  program will take place on Wednesday and Thursday from 3:00 to 6:00 and Saturday from 9:00  to 1:00. The program will begin on October 11, 2018 and end on June 9, 2019. While these  programs and resources exceed the initial $12,366 Title III allocation, we are supplementing with  Fair Student Funding and Achieve Now Grant monies.

Students will receive tutoring and academic skills support specific to content  areas so that they are simultaneously improving their speaking, reading, listening, and writing,  skills while building content knowledge that is essential for passing the Regents exams.   Teachers who are providing these services will receive training via a 5-day after-school institute  on disciplinary literacy and ELLs, which will be facilitated by the assistant principal and ENL  teacher (trainers).  This training will take place from September 25, 2018 – October 9, 2018 for  one hour each day. The teachers teaching the program will be in attendance. Additionally, the  teachers will meet with the trainers monthly to review student work and engage in text-based  discussions around the best strategies to support ELLs with content learning and language  acquisition. They will then turn key this information to their respective departments.  The Support Program will begin October 9, 2018 and continue until June 9, 2019.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, we use are using the  Slosson and Briggance, teacher made  assessments  and NYESLAT data. The data from these assessments indicates that the students are writing approximately two  levels below their own grade and in need of writing support. The teacher made assessments indicates that the students need  help to acquire and use academic language.  The assessments also revealed that the students need more exposure to subject  specific/ Tier III words for continued academic success.  This information guides the teachers planning and aides them  in scaffolding their instruction.  This practice has lead to the creation of a school-wide literacy plan.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   This effort is supported by having the following structures in place. Students with disabilities are assessed using the  Briggance assessment during September and October by their designated case manager. The NYSESLAT data is analyzed and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         reviewed for gains in each of the components: reading, writing, listening and speaking. School wide teacher-created  assessments are administered during the first two weeks of school in ELA and math.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The ELL program is monitored using our AYP data for ELLs. According to last year's status our school met AYP for class pass  rate. However; being that our school was only in its second year,  not enough ELLs  took regents exams to create a cohort.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We created a school-wide academic intervention and tutoring incentive. Students are able to lunch and learn with the science,  math, social studies and ELA teachers two days a week. Schuylerville has also paired with Lehman College to offer an after  school tutoring program on Monday and Tuesday From 2:45-5:00pm where the students can receive homework assistance and  reading and writing practice . This program is in addition to our ELL program on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data reveals an increasing proficiency in listening and speaking from the 2014 data, as well as a  deficiency in writing which has stayed stagnant.                  7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ELL Data Analysis Tool and the EDAT tool that allows us to view a summary of our school's status in order to conference  together as a team and make adjustments to our targeted instructional programs,  programming of classes, our ELL support  institute, resources we purchase and the training and professional developments administered in house as well as which pd to  attend outside of the school community. These adjustments support the accelerated achievement of both our ELLS and non- ELLs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In accordance with CR Part 154.2, ENL is serviced as an integrated program during ELA. A standalone ENL class is given  once a day.  The incoming 9  th   graders are programmed in a cohort that travels together. The remainder of ELLs are  programed together when possible.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      N/A      c.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              All instructional minutes follow the regulations outlined in CR Part 154.2. ENL is delivered to students during a 45 minute  ENL pullout block to the students who scored in the entering and emerging phase as well as to those students deemed to need  the extra support through assessment and lack of credit accumulation. A certified English teacher with the support of the ENL  teacher instructs ELA.   The students who scored   in te transitioning, expanding and commanding   phases are supported  through a disciplinary literacy approach in one or more of their core classes. The students in the commanding phase are  supported for two years after they score commanding. This model is based off of the ENL Units of Study Chart.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Schuylerville Preparatory H.S. has an ENL model in which instruction in the content areas is delivered in English with the ENL  teacher pushing in according to CR Part 154.2.  Instruction is delivered through a disciplinary literacy model that allows for  students to acquire language in Tier II and Tier III. This approach supports the development of academic language and  accelerates  the achievement of ELLs. Students are given scaffolds and multiple entries in order to meet their needs in the  classroom. Teachers use the TOMS to accurately assess the progress of the students in the different levels of the language  acquisition process and to appropriately differentiate the content material for each individual student.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are evaluated in their native language at intake. Spanish-speaking newcomers receive the Spanish LAB to assess their  Spanish proficiency. The students are also entitled to take all major exams in their native language or with the assistance of an  interpreter.  The results of these exams are studied and analyzed for growth.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status            Instruction is organized according to CR Part 154.2 to meet the needs of all proficiency classifications such as SIFE,  newcomers, longterm ELLs and former ELLs. Students are provided with dual language glossaries and dictionaries and native  language glossaries of subject specific words, Technology such as laptops and SMART boards are also available as  scaffolds.  Students are also aided by pre-teaching of vocabulary and concepts that are imperative to the subject at hand.     A. Students who are identified as SIFE are programmed in ICT classes in order to provide individualized attention and trained  teachers who can work with these students.  SIFE are also encouraged to participate in after school tutoring designed to  support them in their content area classes. These students are also scheduled for elective classes that support the content in  the core classes. Regents preparation and lunch-time tutoring are also offered for the continued success of our SIFE  population.     B. Newcomers are engaged in common core, theme-based curriculum which builds vocabulary and academic concepts. These  activities are set up to build students' academic English proficiency through scaffolded instruction. Classroom discourse is  arranged in a manner to promote and develop language acquisitions and academic concepts. They are also paired with  another student to help them feel comfortable and accepted.  These students are also scheduled for elective classes that  support the content in the core classes. Regents preparation and lunch-time tutoring are also offered for the continued  success of our SIFE population.     C. ELLs who have received services from 4 to 6 years receive similar instruction as newcomers; however, fewer scaffolds are  used. Students are engaged in more reading and writing activities to provide them with model work and ample practice with  the use of the English language.  Close attention  is paid to the acquisition of Tier II and Tier III language. the acquisition of this   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      type of vocabulary supports the students learning in each subject area. These students are also supported through social and  emotional means. The students are accessed by our Guidance department to see if they need help with organizational skills,  study skills or counseling as a support. Students are also required to check in with the ENL teacher to review their grades and  progress via a conference once a month.   After school tutoring is available to these students to receive additional help with  their content area classes.      D. Long term ELL instruction differs slightly from that of 4 to 6 year ELLs. While still rigorous, the program focuses on the  students' acquisition of academic language, phonetic awareness, reading and writing strategies, and organization skills.  Close  attention  is paid to the acquisition of Tier II and Tier III language. the acquisition of this type of vocabulary supports the  students learning in each subject area. These students are also supported through social and emotional means.  The students  are accessed by our Guidance department to see if they need help with organizational skills, study skills or counseling as a  support. Students are also required to check in with the ENL teacher to review their grades and progress via a  conference twice a month.   After school and lunchtime  tutoring is available to these students to receive additional help with  their content area classes.     E. Students are immersed in general education curriculum that supports their growth in academic language and content. These  students are exposed to language and vocabulary that continues to accelerate their growth. Students are afforded  opportunities to receive individualized support before/after school and during lunch.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    ELL-SWDs are first assessed using Slosson and Brigance as well as performance series and teacher made tests.  ENL and IEP  teachers work together closely to teach students how to use close reading and annotation strategies to foster their literacy  skills. Organizational and time management strategies are taught to assist the students completing classroom tasks, studying  and project completion. Pre-teaching is also done as necessary to build schema and allow an access point for classroom  instruction. Students are also given the opportunity to attend tutoring and receive homework help during lunch or after- school.  Clubs are offered before and after school to support the students academic growth as well as their social and  emotional growth. The ELL-SD's in the 11th and 12th grade are also encouraged to use the college success center on campus  and to attend college fairs and workshops to be prepared for the college application process.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     Schuylerville Prep ENL and IEP teachers use close reading and annotation strategies to foster the literacy skills of the ELL- SWDs. Organizational and time management strategies are taught to assist the students completing classroom tasks, studying  and project completion. Pre-teaching is also done as necessary to build schema and allow an access point for classroom  instruction.   Enl teachers co-teach and plan with both the content area teacher, the coach and the special education teacher  during common planning time to scaffold and differentiate materials in order to create multiple entry points and the maximum  percentage of success for the students.   The lessons are implemented and student work is observed and analyzed during  common planning in order to make adjustments to the lessons.             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Schuylerville Prep offers afterschool tutoring and regents preparation for all ELL subgroups for science, math and ELA in English  with support in Spanish when available. This year we are adding two new ELA electives in creative writing and English  explorations to support the continued development of our ELLs in the English language.  To continue our support of the  science content area we added an ecology course and a sports anatomy course. The extra exposure to the science content and  scientific thinking will reinforce what is taught in living environment, earth science and chemistry by keeping the student  thinking, writing and speaking like scientists. A new social studies elective was created based on the same principal. The math  department has been enhanced by adding Finite Algebra and Analytical math. These electives were specifically chosen based   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      on our students performance in previous algebra and geometry courses and will support  the development of their  mathematical skills.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In order to better support the academic goals of our ELLs, a integrated co-teaching program has been activated according to  the guidelines of CR Part 154.2.  in order to meet the high demands of our students we will obtained another ENL teacher. We  also now have two dual licensed teachers one with a social studies license and one with an English license. We are also  planning on adding two more professional development sessions to support our content area teachers in their instruction of  ELLs. One will take place in the fall semester and one will take place in the spring semester. Also the classes listed above have  been added based on careful review of students progress in each content area.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not had a bilingual program. We do review our parent choice data to see if it merits the start of a bilingual  program. At this time the data does not support the need for a bilingual program according to the guidelines. The  ENL  program is actually growing as the ELL population is growing.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are provided with equal scheduling access to classes, after school tutoring and regents preparation classes. Our ELL  institute is offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3-5. This institute offers assistance in English, Math and  Science.  Homework help is offered on Saturdays from 9-12. We have a breakfast club which is available to students from 7:30  -8:00 Monday- Friday. This program offers social and emotional support.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ELLs are provided with laptops to help in translation. A recording and translation device and program are set up for a  student who is a ELL as well as having a hearing impairment.  . Students are provided with dual language glossaries and  dictionaries and native language glossaries of subject specific words, Technology such as laptops and SMART boards are also  available as scaffolds. Students are also aided by pre-teaching of vocabulary and concepts that are imperative to the subject at  hand. We are in the process of purchasing an  Babylon, an interpretation software for teachers to use to support the students  development using their native language.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Schuylerville prep has an ENL program. As part of this program and all content area instruction home language is supported  and encouraged in order to foster second language acquisition. We offer students and parents the opportunity to meet with us  and discuss progress with either a staff member that speaks the native language or through the translation and interpretation  service offered by the DOE.  We also provide documents to the home that have been translated. Students are paired up with  other d=students that speak the same language whenever possible.   We are in the process of purchasing an  Babylon, an  interpretation software for teachers to use to support the students development using their native language. At this time, we  do not have DL or TBE.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Schuylerville Prep has a Pupil Personnel Team (PPT) that meets every Thursday. The team consists of guidance, the Special  Education coordinator, ENL coordinator, the Attendance teacher and a member of the disciplinary team. Together the PPT  team reviews data such as grades, progress reports, regents scores and information placed in our online grade book and makes  decisions on supports and services. These finding then help in defining how students will be scheduled and the supports they  will be offered.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   A summer bridge program is available for newly enrolled students including ELLs. There is also a field day for the students to  meet other members of the school community.  These ELLS as well as ELLs enrolled throughout the year are also partnered  with ELLs that have been enrolled in order to give them a "buddy" to help them feel more comfortable and aid them in their  adjustment period. The principal, guidance counselor, parent coordinator/ community associate, ENL teacher, student  ambassadors and parent association members all participate in these activities.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The only language elective offered at this time is Spanish. The school is in its third year and more electives will be offered as  the school grows.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher receives professional development that will adhance the learning of Ell students. 50% of the professional  developmentwill be ELL-specific training.  The ENL teacher receives Pd from a variety of sources to ensure proper training  according to CR Part 154. Trainings are scheduled through but not limited to organizations such as Fordham NYCRBERN  network and The Division of English Language Learners & Student Support.          The ENL teacher receives proffessional development from a variety of sources to ensure proper training according to CR Part  154. Trainings are scheduled through but not limited to organizations such as Fordham NYCRBERN network and the Office of  ELLs.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In order to make the transition from middle to high school, a summer bridge program is available for newly enrolled students  including ELLs. There is also a field day for the students to meet other members of the school community.  These ELLS as well  as ELLs enrolled throughout the year are also partnered with ELLs that have been enrolled in order to give them a "buddy" to  help them feel more comfortable and aid them in their adjustment period.      Using the NYC Public School guidelines as well as CR Part 154.2, Schuylerville has set up a professional development schedule,  which takes place on Fridays from 1:07-3:40pm. The data from the 2014-2015 regents, credit accumulation and Quality Review  has driven our professional development schedule. The ENL teacher will attend ELL-specific professional development offered  by the Fordham RBERN program and the Division of the Office of the Ells. The content area teachers will also attend content- based Ell-specific workshops through the Division of the Office of the Ells and the Borough Field Support Office.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher schedules meetings with parents on a weekly/biweekly basis based on parent availability and the availability  of a translator or IEP teacher as needed. The meetings are scheduled during parent the engagement time that has been set  aside each week. If this time does not work for the parent, another agreed upon time is scheduled. These meetings are  documented in the ENL teacher's ELL Annual Individual Meeting log.   During these meetings, the parents are notified of the  students progress. The students transcripts and grades in Skedula are reviewed and any concerns are addressed.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   One of our goals at Schuylerville Prep is to increase ELL parent involvement in order to increase the performance of ELLs. The  first step in our plan was hiring our new Parent Coordinator, Mr. Wilson Lantigua. He is working closely with the PA to address  the needs of parents.  Schuylerville Prep will have ample opportunities for both formal and informal face-to-face meetings and interactions. The first  direct meeting with parents occurred September 28, 2017 as part of the school's parent outreach and community building  initiative. On October 11, 2017 the school will host our first Senior parent information evening. Parent teacher report card  conferences will take place in the fall on November 9 and 10 and in the Spring on March 8 and 9. All ENL students will have an  additionalmeeting scheduled this year to address language progress.  On May 3, we will have last parent meeting in which we  will celebrate our students accomplishments.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melissa Ramos, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Schuylerville Preparatory H.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We use a variety of data sources to assess the language preferences of the parent community. Parent language  preferences are first identified by designated staff when a new student is enrolled during the orientation. At this  time, parents are interviewed, emergency contact cards are filled out and the HLIS is completed as required. .  Parent home language preferences are rechecked each year using ATS reports during parent/teacher conferences,  upon the submission of new blue cards, and when the parent coordinator completes his annual survey.          2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Our school community can now communicate with parents through a program called Kinvo. This program is used to  take attendance as well as send messages to parents and guardians. All of the parents' contact information is entered  into Kinvo. We then send messages directly to the phone of the parent or guardian in real time. These messages are  automatically translated by the program.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 ensures that LEP parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in  and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education. Here at Schuylerville, we take this very  seriously. On the first Professional Development day of the school year in September, a training is conducted for all  staff. During this meeting, the staff is made aware of the importance that communication with our LEP parents. Staff  is provided with the names of employees that speak languages other than English and they are given information  about the over the phone interpretation services as well as where to find the number if lost or needed. The staff is  also informed that one of the programs we use, Kinvo, which automatically translates messages sent to the parents.  Staff is given an overview of the Language Access Kit, its purpose and how it is used. The Language Access Kit is  available in the main office, the guidance suite and the ENL teacher's office.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services are fulfilled upon admission. All  parents will be notified that they are entitled to a translator, and, to translated oral and written communications. The  language Access kit is used for this purpose.
