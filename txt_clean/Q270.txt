This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Gordon Parks School for Inquisitive Minds, PS/IS 270, will offer a challenging and rigorous academic curriculum  centered on students. We will achieve this in a safe, engaging, rigorous and supportive learning environment that has  high expectations of our students from our staff, home and community.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S./I.S. 270Q is a Pre-K-8 lottery school serving 681 students, located in Rosedale, New York. The school was renamed  The Gordon Parks Schools for Inquisitive Minds to reflect the school’s focus on the Arts in 2009. As of 2015, our focus  is also inclusive of STEM and Computer Science. 17% of our population are SWD and 54% qualifies for free lunch. Boys  account for 51% of the students enrolled and girls account for 49%. Over the course of the last three years the  student population has increased exponentially. The average attendance rate for the school is 95.9%   In an effort to build learners with increased literacy skills across core disciplines, who are digitally literate, as well as  develop analytical and computational thinkers we have implemented CS4All PK-8th grade. Our extended curriculum is  filled with Abstractions, Algorithms, and Programming. Based on grade bands these include units for  Digital Citizenship, Keyboarding, Programming Languages: Blocky, Java Script, Python, HTML and CSS;  Physical Computing with Robotics and Website Design. 4th and 5 th graders have involvement in an infusion of  interdisciplinary and constructivist-based activities in collaboration with FACE Lab which also helps to increase the  collaboration between parents and educators in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM)  education. FaceLab achieves this by training parents and teachers to lead hands-on robotics . We have expanded  implementation of STEM initiatives in our middle school division through our implementation of math and science  enrichment classes. Offering these programs in 6th through 8th grades will continue to increase the number of  eligible students who can participate in the Algebra Regents. Our instructional focus for the upcoming year will be  incorporating a variety of research based strategies to create multiple entry points aligned to rigorous tasks for  reliable student outcomes in all subgroups. To foster student leadership we have incorporated a Student Council in  our middle school and reinenforced The Seven Habits inclusive of monthly assemblies school-wide.    Enriching Academically Talented Students (EATS) is a school-wide after school program that enriches our students  academically while cultivating their talents. Students learn social skills, work collaboratively, develop leadership  qualities and engage in competition regularly. This program enhances our students’ education by bringing new  concepts into view. Our in-house teachers help to foster our belief that learning should be fun by stimulating both  creative and critical thinking of students. Our students have the opportunity to express themselves through the art of  dance, physical fitness through swimming and partnership with USTA/NJTL to provide tennis instruction. STEM  instruction has expanded through both EATS after-school; through the incorporation of Design2Learn an engineering  initiative and Science Olympiad competition. As well as through middle school participation in CS4ALL's Hack League  competition. Ongoing for the past several years the Champs program allows middle school students to enhance their  physicality in the areas of Basketball and Volleyball. A new Champs initiative for this year is Boks for Kids which brings  an after school physical education program for 3rd to 5th grade students to strengthen their minds and bodies  through movement. Arts infusion in after school for our Middle School students is being incorporated through  participation in Broadway Jr. for our 3rd year. Also enhancing our Arts program through the Mayor’s initiative for the  past several years is SONYC, COMPASS NYC , the Black Spectrum Theatre Co., Inc. is the Entertainment Careers After  School Program (ECAP) for our middle school students. Students are given the opportunities to learn and develop  understanding of film making, photography, fashion design, theatrical acting, audio production and scenery creation.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   17% of our student population are students with disabilities, SWDs. There are 4 self contained classes and 9 ICT  classes. Due to varied instructional needs of our SWDs, our instructional focus is to ensure that scaffolds are an  embedded component of all lessons. This aligns with making content accessible to all. We currently have 6 ENLs. As a  result, our foreign language teacher doubles as our ENL service provider.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      PS / IS 270 consistently conveys high expectations through ongoing feedback to all stakeholders including staff,  students, and families. Moving forward, the key areas of focus specific to the framework will be Rigorous Instruction  and Collaborative Teachers. Fostering a more communal environment within our school community will cement the  level of transparency across staff, teachers, parents and administrators. Showing students that everyone is working  toward the shared goal of their success. Principal and Assistant Principals will continue nurturing professional growth  of teachers and staff through developing teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs inclusive of all learners,  which includes students with disabilities and English as a New Language learners. Administration will also foster the  engagement of structured professional collaborations using Teacher teams. The School Leadership Team, SLT, will also  focus on ways to grow leadership capacity by continuing the infusion of strategies from Gung Ho by Ken Blanchard .  This will foster the involvement of all constituents to ensure our school community reinforces the support of student  achievement for all learners.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q270   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05,0 6,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   753   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The social and emotional needs of students, including self-worth, self-esteem, and self-control, are typical of the age  group we serve; especially the middle school grades. OORS data reveals that the majority of incidents occur during  lunch periods, when students require the most self-control and social skills. Creating a coherent, school-wide culture  that reflects a common set of standards/expectations and protocol that all staff members rely on to communicate  effectively with students, fostering legitimacy, agency, and voice.    After analyzing the data from last year's school quality guide, it was very apparent that we needed to make  modifications to our existing practices specific to "creating a supportive environment". According to the data, we  were below the city average specific to students' personal attention and support by 9 percentage points. Only 55% of  our student population surveyed felt that enough was done to prevent bullying, down 8 percentage points from the  city average. To address supporting the whole child, we have incorporated a couple of practices and programs into  our school schedule this year. We're engaging in a partnership with "Success Mindset", a CBO committed to having  students experience how vital their "voice" is through the incorporation of the "7 Habits...". The Student Government  Association, SGA, was launched this school year. As a result of this work, monthly assemblies/ town halls will be  hosted providing another forum for students to voice their opinions.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019 , 100% of all staff will provide a supportive environment that builds student leadership and provides  personal attention and support by reinforcing The Seven Habits. This will be measured by a 5% increase in the  Supportive Environment section of the School Quality Guide.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Teachers and support staff will continue to engage in ongoing  social emotional learning opportunities throughout the school  year. This training will be based on 7 Habits and Restorative  Circles. The behavior intervention and strategies guides for Pre- K-8 were purchased for every staff member to promote a  common language and incorporate coherent strategies all can  utilize to promote positive behavior.    Teachers, support staff, and administrators will support a socio- emotional environment through visual representation by  creating monthly banners highlighting the Habit of Focus or  strategy to be displayed around the school.    Students with special needs, English language learners, students  participating in Future Leaders and peer mediators will be  supported through immersion activities during designated  weekly class sessions for studying the 7 Habits of Highly Effective  Teens and/or restorative circles.   Monthly workshops will be based on Restorative Circles and 7  Habits which will highlight a different strategy for each month.  Parents will engage in sessions with administrators as they  unpack a different community related topic each month. These  programs will be promoted at the "Back to School " night on  September 17, 2018 with fliers, robo-calls, informational packets  and monthly calendars.    All staff will use the same language and specific vocabulary as  highlighted in the provided text and resources which be  measured through Danielson Rubric Domain 2.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Building wide, teachers use Fountas and Pinnell as a literacy assessment tool four times a year to ensure that reading and  comprehension skills are progressing. As these skills are measured on a regular basis, needs are analyzed and addressed  accordingly. Additional teacher created assessments are utilized including but not limited to: regularly documented student  teacher conferences in which specific feedback described as “glows & grows” are provided, recorded observations of student  work are conducted, and resources and or measurement tools such as consistent task specific rubrics are embedded in  curriculum providing scores that facilitate student needs and subsequent instructional planning.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      The administration team distributes a school wide assessment calendar in the beginning of the academic year. The calendar  maps out formative and standardized assessments that are scheduled for the year. Deadlines help the teachers to plan their  lessons and set aside time for individual or group assessments. This may include beginning of the year Baseline/diagnostic  assessments; periodic writing tasks; Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessments; and New York State Exams.   The school has a testing team that coordinates with staff members to ensure testing materials are prepared and distributed.  The team also ensures that students requiring accommodations, which include the Special Education and ELL population, are  provided with appropriate and mandated accommodations.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments used to acquire baseline skills and progress again involve Fountas & Pinnell. Additionally, Ready Gen  performance tasks are used in grades K-5, and Code X curriculum from grades 6-8 has built in end of unit writing performance  tasks which are utilized to measure student’s reading and writing abilities. NYC Performance tasks are given at the beginning  and end of the year. Other summative assessments include MOSL, Mock state exam for both ELA & Math. Finally, the NYS  Common Core exam is administered and observed as a means of noting progress and areas of student need for  vertical planning.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school has an RTI (Response to Intervention) Point Person who is in charge of gathering data from intervention providers  (RTI Team). The team analyzes student data to ensure growth or lack thereof. This measurement then becomes the basis for  continuation or termination of nonmandated RTI services.   To ensure there is continuity between RTI services and evaluation for eligibility for special education services, the school has a  Pupil Personnel Committee & a Student Implementation Team / SIT committee that meets at least once a month to discuss  progress and the possible need for additional support services and or further testing.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]     The school has an RTI Plan that is presented to staff members. Response to Intervention Guidelines are implemented to  ensure that students are provided services at all tier levels. English Language Learners are therefore a part of the schoolwide  RTI Program. The Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment has been utilized to determine reading levels of all students across  grade levels. The NYC Performance Task was also administered to students in testing grades. The school administration data  specialist (in the building) workings with administrators & teachers to ensure strong core instruction is delivered to all students  addressing student needs as reflected by the results of the universal screening tools and other formative and summative  assessments. The RTI Committee is comprised of service providers, principal, guidance counselor and lead teachers who meet  weekly. Each classroom teacher has a chart that depicts student movement across reading levels or lack thereof. Based on this  data, reading groups are developed and instruction is differentiated to address needs. Groupings are modified periodically  based on academic performance, specific population such as ELLs, and overall student response to strategies utilized by the  teacher. If deemed necessary, more intensive intervention - Tier 2 or Tier 3 are provided to ensure students are given  appropriate level of academic assistance before special education is considered. For ELL students, the same procedures is  followed in collaboration with the English as a New Language / ENL provider.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Instruction is data-driven; teachers and the school leadership team look at data such as standardized test (LAB-R, NYSESLAT,  NYSITELL, State Exams), MOSLs, Fountas and Pinnell data as well as informal assessments. The NYSESLAT modality report, in  particular, is a helpful tool in determining the specific areas of concern that need to be addressed in order for ELLs to meet  appropriate yearly progress.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   During school wide meetings, administration presents data to staff members for analysis and identification of trends and  implications for instruction. The faculty, teacher teams and committees group students based on the populations they work   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         with. Furthermore, teacher teams meet on a regular basis to ensure student performance is monitored and  instructional decisions are made collaboratively. Teachers constantly communicate with their colleagues and discuss the  effectiveness of the program and what modification need to be made.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Currently, the school is delivering a Free Standing ENL program via the integrated and standalone model in  compliance with the mandated ENL instruction hours for individual students. ELL students are in regular classes in  heterogeneous and mixed proficiency levels. The teachers plan and co-teach the classes. Lessons are planned in a way  where ENL strategies are integrated into the instruction so that students can access grade level curriculum. Stand ENL  students are serviced by grade and proficiency level.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   In the ESL Provider's schedule schedule, appropriate number of periods per day are allotted to see ESL students. Required  number of minutes of ESL instruction and ELA as per CR Part 154 is provided to all ELL students.              3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The only available program in the school is ESL. The ESL provider utilizes a push-in model aligned to the instructional content in  the classroom. The ESL teacher focuses on scaffolding strategies to create entry points for students making the Common Core  Curriculum content comprehensible for students. Some scaffolding strategies utilized are graphic organizers, the emphasis on  front loading academic vocabulary, as well as daily language objective engaging students in discussions around content specific  topics. The school uses the Balanced Literacy Approach across curriculum areas. All instruction is planned with all learning  styles and modalities in mind. To foster language development and to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards, teachers utilize differentiated instruction and learning activities that encourage interaction among students. ENL  instructional moves are also incorporated in the lessons for example using the picture mosaics to develop student knowledge  of a topic or to create questions they have based on the images and quotes, collaborative posters to hold all students  accountable as well as for the teacher to assess the student, the Question Matrix, think- write-pair-share to provide all student  an opportunity to think, process and share information.               4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The only program available in the school is ESL. Although the school does not offer a bilingual program, native language  support is made available for evaluation services whenever possible. Currently, the ESL provider speaks Spanish. In the event  that the Haitian-Creole students require assistance, we have a Speech and Language Therapist who is available to translate.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      The school keeps a record of staff members who are fluent in other native languages should the need for translation and  interpretation arise. For General Education students that are being evaluated for Special Education services or Special  Education students that require re evaluation related to IEP, the school seeks services of bilingual evaluators to perform  psycho educational evaluation and standardized tests that measure eligibility for Special Education/related services.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      Presently, we do not have any SIFE students and long term ELLs in the building. In the event that we do, we will extend our  services to SIFE children in such a way that they will be able to catch up on the knowledge and skills that they need to meet  the grade level standards. For our current long-term ELL, the focus will be increasing comprehension and writing skills as well  as developing higher order thinking skills. For long term ELLs receiving 4-6 years of services, the ESL provider will develop  programs that will encourage independence. In addition, the ultimate goal is to increase functional reading and speaking skills  that will eventually help them prepare to complete high school applications and job interviews. This will also be the focus of  instruction. Skills that will help them in writing resumes and application letters will also be taught. Daily life conversations, and  academic vocabulary will continue to be enhanced as transition goals and services are integrated with lessons. In order to  foster independence and acquisition of skills needed as they move up to middle school and high school and into adulthood,  students will have access to hands-on experience via the school’s employment program.   Freestanding ESL instruction is delivered via the integrated model where both teachers co-teach in the classroom. The  program model that is being used is differentiated instruction wherein students work in small groups and are provided  grade/ability appropriate activities. Students receive whole class, small group or one-to-one guided teaching. All ELLs receive  instructional minutes as required under CR Part 154 – 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week for beginning and intermediate  level. Newcomers receive basic foundational skills as well as content instruction using various instructional moves/strategies in  an integrated and stand alone model.     All levels of proficiency use the instructional moves/strategies and are engage in various levels of work. All ELLs are  encouraged to see the ENL provider when they need extra assistance in any of their work beside their mandated time.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The scaffolding strategies and instructional moves mentioned above support our ELLs-SWD on the learning continuum. In  addition to differentiated instruction the ESL service provider consults regularly with classroom teachers and all service  providers working with ELLs to insure that instructional goals are customized to meet their needs. The teachers use Ready Gen,  Code-x, Lexia, Reading A- Z, Imagine Learning, teacher-made materials and online resources to provide access to academic  content areas and accelerate English language development.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students, regardless of the academic level or English proficiency, are provided the opportunity to participate in a variety of  extracurricular activities. During special assemblies, shows, or even sports/physical education events, all students are given  equal opportunity to be involved. Auditions and invitations are extended to all learners to ensure everyone is given a chance to  learn in a different type of environment. Students with disabilities and ELLs are provided with the opportunity to perform or  interact with students in a least restrictive environment.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Currently, the school is providing intervention programs across all grade levels and subject areas. Small group intervention  programs for all students that struggle in ELA and Math are offered during the class time. RTI, is offered as well, which occurs  throughout the day, is designed in such a way that students that have similar academic needs are grouped together.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, the team is planning to improve and intensify current programs. We will improve by adding  more resources - both printed and digital. Groups will be smaller and more intervention specialists will be involved to ensure  individual needs are met.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All services afforded to all general education and special education students are offered to ELL students. Students can  participate in E.A.T.S, CHAMPS, Theater Program, Multicultural Show, College Career Readiness program and are invited to all  school trips.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  One of the school's CEP goals is to strengthen the integration of technology with instruction. In line with this, ELL students are  provided learning activities that involve the use of technology such as the utilization of the smart board and the iPad. The ENL  provider uses a variety of printed materials such dictionaries, thesauruses, books targeting specific language skills, content  area textbooks and literary books. To ensure hands-on learning, the provider uses flash cards, magnetic letters, talking pens,  wrap-ups, and other manipulatives. Learning A - Z and Lexia are used to reinforce phonetic skills, reading, reading  comprehension, and writing.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The school only offers ESL program. However, native language support is made available whenever possible. Currently, the ESL  provider speaks Spanish and can provide native language support. In the event that the Haitian-Creole students or their  parents require assistance, we have a Speech and Language Therapist who is available to translate. The school maintains a list  of staff members who are fluent in other native languages should the need for translation and interpretation arise. If further  support in student's native language is needed, we will contact the Office of English Learners for assistance.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   To ensure service supports and resources correspond to the ELLs' age and grade level, the provider uses differentiated  instruction. As the ESL group is composed of students varying in ages, grade level and ability, the teacher prepares different  activities that address individual needs in correlation with the classroom.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled ELLs and their families are invited to an orientation meeting with the  parent coordinator, ENL Provider, and administration team. At this time parents are made aware of the curriculum and what  the school has to offer in regards to assisting students and families that have non-English home language. Expectations  regarding partnership with families to ensure student success is also discussed. The school counselor also informs parents for  middle school aged students about the high school articulation process. They are able to receive materials in their  parent’s/child’s home language. If there any parental concerns it is addressed with a translator. The school counselor also   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         speaks to the students about study habits, organizational skills, and college preparation.     Every year, the parent coordinator hosts a parent-to-parent breakfast for parents of students with disabilities and English  Language Learners. At this event, current teachers and providers are introduced to parents. Parents are given a chance to  discuss amongst themselves the challenges and joys of ENL parents best practices .     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is the only language elective offered in our school.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  For the upcoming school year, ENL Providers; general education and special education teachers; other service providers; as  well as paraprofessionals who work with ELLs will be sent to workshops to improve delivery of ESL service and to comply with  the required hours of ELL Training every five years for professional certificate holders. The ENL teacher will continue attending  ELL Instructional Leardership Institute. General education/content teachers will be also sent to attend PD for ELLs offered by  ELL Queens South Team. Staff members will be attending general workshops on technology in the classroom; and curriculum  and instruction that can be applied in teaching the ELLs. Teachers will attend a variety of trainings offered by the network and  the UFT. Teachers will also be encouraged to take advantage of internet-based seminars designed to provide information and  strategies to better facilitate learning among ELL students as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. The school  administration also provides in-house professional development opportunities that are conducted during teacher team  meeting, common planning preps, and faculty conference. The following are the specific professional activities that have been  and will be put in place to assist the teachers with their ELL population: 1. Introductory workshop identifying the ELL  population, mandated hours, ESL schedule, 2. How to Write Language Objectives 3. SESIS Training focusing on ELL students  with IEP 4. ELL Strategies/instructional moves or the classroom: Picture mosaic, Question Matrix, think-write-pair-share,  shades of meaning, conversation club house, instructional conversations, etc.. 5. Turn-key from ELL workshops attended by  ELL/Special Ed Liaison 6. Common Core Workshops 7. Technology workshops - specific apps and programs for ELLs correlated  to content area 8.

All records are kept in a binder.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher provides PD’s for all teachers. The workshops that the ENL teacher attends are them turnkeyed to the staff.  The ENL teacher attends Professional development at the district.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL and teachers are in constant communication with parents to discuss academic and language profiency and  development. Meetings are held with parents and translators are provided. Parents in our school, including the parents of ELL  show a high level of involvement. They actively participate in parent meetings and gatherings which include workshops,  student special performances, School Leadership Team (SLT) and PTA assemblies, open school nights and other projects such  as book sale.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The school Parent Coordinator works diligently in order to evaluate and provide the needs of the parents such as providing  flyers, notices and upcoming events in their native languages. Parents are invited to school wide, district wide and city wide  events via translated documentation. Parent workshops are conducted at least once a month that address a variety of issues. A  parent to parent workshop is conducted with Parents, Teachers and serivce providers in order to address various issues such  as IEP’s, special needs, effective comminucation and other resources that are available in the building. The school counselor is  also available for consultation and gives the parents information about resources and places they could go to for translation  and language classes. The school partners with community based organizations such as Resources for Parents, Black Spectrum,  the Queens Public Library, New York Library, American Red Cross, NYPD, FDNY, ACS, HRA, Preventive Services, NYC Parks  Department, Delta Sigma Theta, American Cancer Society, The Family Justice Center, New York Life Insurance, Zumba, and  Health Plus, to provide assistance and services to ELL parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Chayvonne Harper, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
