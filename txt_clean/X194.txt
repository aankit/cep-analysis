This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our mission is to support students in achieving their educational potential by providing a safe learning environment,  inspiring a love for learning, and encouraging parents to become partners in education.                  2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/MS 194 is located in a Northeast Bronx neighborhood that is a combination of industrial, commercial, and  residential areas. The building boasts a newly renovated gymnasium and technology lab, an upgraded auditorium, and  SMARTBoards in every classroom. A walk through the wide corridors reveals alcoves in which tables and white boards  have been placed for instructional use by Academic Intervention Service (AIS) providers with targeted students. The  school also has laptop and iPad mini technology carts for use in instruction and as rewards.    The instructional focus of PS/MS 194 is, “If all teachers use formative assessment data to deliver multiple methods of  presentation and multiple points of entry in all content areas, then we will promote divergent thinking, increase  student access to the curricula, and improve student engagement.” This instructional focus was developed  collaboratively between the administration and staff and speaks to our shared belief that, with strategic  differentiation for struggling and advanced learners alike, all students can achieve academic success.    PS/MS 194 is partnered with Ultimate Enrichment, an after school program that includes academic support, arts, and  sports for all grades, K-8. In order to promote the Arts in education, we are partnered with the Shubert  Foundation/Music Theater International Broadway Junior Program.    Our mission here at PS/MS 194 is to support students in achieving their educational potential by providing a safe  learning environment, inspiring a love for learning, and encouraging parents to become partners in education. In an  effort to support our mission and the Chancellor’s vision, we have formed the PS/MS 194 Equity Team for 2018-2019.    3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.         Our special populations include Students with Disabilities, English Language Learners, and students in need of  intervention and at-risk support. In order for Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners to access the  curriculum and demonstrate growth, these students need explicit, direct instruction, along with frequent modeling  and visual support. Our instructional focus incorporates the elements of Universal Design for Learning, particularly  with regard to multiple methods of presentation and multiple means of expression.            Some of our Students with Disabilities also require additional adult support, which we provide during Integrated Co- Teaching classes and through the implementation of paraprofessional services. Several of our Students with  Disabilities require related services, all of which are provided within the school building. In addition to being   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      supported daily within the classroom by our classroom teachers and ENL staff, our English Language Learners are  invited to attend after school ENL programs as well as Saturday ENL programs.            To support our students in need of intervention and at-risk support, for both academics and behavior, we utilize  formative and summative assessment data to identify the students. We also hold weekly Child Study Team meetings  and weekly PBIS Tier II/III meetings to identify students in need. After identification, we provide the students with  small group Academic Intervention Services, at-risk counseling, and Check-in/Check-out services as needed.   4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.               Our school has made the most progress over the past year in the element of Student Achievement within the  Framework for Great Schools. Through a school-wide emphasis on the use of formative assessment data to drive  instruction, we have increased our NYS test scores in ELA from 34% to 37% and in math from 39% to 43%. This was  evidenced in our 2017-18 NYC School Quality Snapshot. We also continue to strengthen our Strong Family Community  Ties as evidenced by a 2% increase on the NYC School Survey. Additionally, we hold annual celebrations of learning  which include: The Art Expo, Science Fair, and Career Day as well as ongoing class assemblies and parent events.   Our key area of focus this year will be on the element of Collaborative Teachers with a focus on providing quality  professional opportunities to develop, grow, and contribute to the continuous improvement of the school  community.   Based on feedback from our last Quality Review 2016-2017, 4.2; Engage in structured professional collaborations on  teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning, we  formed an ENL Data Inquiry Team to improve student outcomes. This year we will continue this work and include  other subgroups such as student with disabilities. This approach will enable us to examine student work, generate  timely data, and use actionable performance information to drive instructional practices and improve student  outcomes.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X194   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05,0 6,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1326   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     In September 2018, all teachers were presented with all the MoSL selections. As was required by the DOE, we  established a MOSL Committee made up of teachers, the UFT Delegate, and administrators to evaluate the various  assessment options available, compared these with the strengths of our staff and students, and jointly decided upon  those assessments that would benefit all while simultaneously sharing the demands of the assessments equally. In  collaboration with coaches, grade leaders, and consultants, we established procedures for the administration and  scoring of both MOSL assessments and end-of-unit assessments in all core subjects. Professional development on the  analysis of test data, as well as professional development determined as necessary based upon test data, occurs  during weekly common planning periods and grade level or department meetings. During common planning and  professional learning time teachers (2 x week) create assessments aligned to the new standards.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/MS 194, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS/MS 194 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents.

Our interventions focus on Literacy, ENL and Math, as well as prepare the students for the  NYSESLAT and the English Language Arts and Math Exams. Our ENL After-school program  takes place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 to 4PM, from November 2018 to May  2019. Students are grouped by reading level, within two contiguous grades of the expanding  level, to allow for proper differentiation. Students are instructed using the Focused Reading  Workbooks to strengthen reading and writing skills.  Classes are filled at 15 students, which  allows for all students the opportunity to participate in this program.  Where possible, teachers  use Native Language support to help students comprehend the materials.  Six certified ENL  teachers work in this program to help co-teach, where they lend ENL strategies and support to  the Common Branch and Content area teachers.  The ENL After-School  program is designed to  target instruction addressing all four modalities with differentiated instruction.  In addition to  these materials, students use Brainpop.com during these sessions.  This is an interactive  computer program that is appropriate for all levels and has a variety of activities to enhance Ells’  vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading comprehension, and writing skills.

The purpose of this professional  development is to inform and familiarize the staff with the methodologies and tools so that  teachers can help the ELLs move toward proficiency in English.  TESOL teachers and classroom  teachers utilize this time to collaborate,  review data to tailor instruction to the needs of the  students, and receive training and support in the Common Core Learning Standards. The  professional development sessions take place every Monday,  in addition to full day staff  development P.D.  These sessions engage teachers in hands-on preparation of Ready Gen,  Expeditionary Learning, Go Math, Glencoe and CMP3 programs. Professional Development  activities are designed for our target audience, content area, AIS and TESOL teachers, to assess  data , identify individual strengths and weaknesses and project future goals that will be utilized  in the differentiation of instructions. Many of the sessions that have already taken place gave us  the opportunity to norm the Measures of Student Learning Performance (MOSL).  These pre- assessments help us to drive instruction and help students succeed in the challenges that CCLS  presents.  The American Reading Company has been coaching the staff since September 2011 by  providing P.D.s with the Action 100 reading program.  In addition, Professional Development on  differentiation, behavior modifications, questioning techniques and computer science are given  throughout the year. Since all teachers in our school affect the learning outcomes of ELLs, we  conduct workshops that include all pedagogues.These PD's are rotated throughout the year so  that all teachers have the opportunity to enhance their learning and experience.  The P.D. is given  by qualified staff members.  In addition, The district ELL Services Coordinator plans monthly meetings for ELL Liaisons in  each school.  The information is then turn keyed to the rest of the department.  Decisions are then  made on which topics should be covered for all staff members at our weekly P.D.  sessions.  September P.D. included topics such as, Components of an Integrated ENL Program  and Seven Models for Co-teaching.  The October meeting will include scheduling for ENL  teachers.  Topics will continued to be explored and shared with the staff based on teachers  needs.  All new information will be disseminated and discussed in order to make decisions that  are best for our ELLs.Some pre-planned workshops include:  Nov. The Power of Power Goals- Grade 1  Dec.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?      When children are admitted to our school they are assessed using the eIRLA.  This reading assessment identifies students  ability in reading readiness skills such as: reading right to left, identifying letters and sounds and using picture clues.  Students  are then placed on proper reading levels to begin practicing their literacy skills.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support our new arrivals the Literacy Coach sets up the eIRLA account so that students can be leveled promptly and  students can begin to receive credit for their early literacy efforts.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In Mathematics, NYC performance tasks are given after each unit. In English Language Arts, Performance Based Assessments  on grades K-2 are given after every unit of the Ready Gen program.On grades 3-8, Expeditionary Learning mid-unit  assessments and end of unit assessments are given.Students who are struggling with the comprehension and writing are then  offered a re- teach lesson provided by the ENL teacher.              4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The structures we have in place to address interventions are: Fundations/Wilson, Imagine Learning English,  AIS, ENL After- school program and the ENL Saturday program. These programs help close the gap between students' literacy levels and grade  levels.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The data gathered from the baseline assessments, NYSITELL, ELA and the NYSESLAT  gives us come crucial insights as to which  areas our ELLs are struggling in.  One significant insight is that many ELLs lack the foundational skills in their first  language.  Therefore, their acquisition of English is more challenging.  This is where the intervention strategies of RTI play a  crucial role.  At risk ELLs work in smaller groups to receive intensive targeted instruction.  Teachers focus on basic elements  such as letter/sound relationships and building on word families before moving on to higher level comprehension activities.  As  a supplement, classroom and ENL teachers are now using Action 100 tool kits to help students gain knowledge of English  grammar and language structure, to improve their reading and writing skills.  Students who do not show expected results then  move on to Tierlll RTI where a one on one approach is used.  With a greater influx of Arabic and Spanish speaking newcomers,  our computer based program Imagine Learning English these students transfer their knowledge to English.  The program is  designed to use Native Language instructions for students to complete the activity and then slowly replace the Native  language with English.  In most cases, ELLs are placed into one of two classes on the grade.  ENL teachers, using the integrated  co-teaching approach will support our ELLs to access grade level curriculum in all subject areas.  In a stand-alone program,  licensed ENL teachers work with groups of 7-15 students using Language Power curriculum, to teach and strengthen  knowledge and understanding of the English Language.  These books are designed to have a hands on approach,  accommodating their individual styles,  for example: cutting, gluing, songs, poems and books.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The ENL department gathers information from the NYSESLAT, ELA, Math State exams, beginning of year and end of year  baseline assessments. We analyze the data  to determine the areas of strengths and weaknesses to inform our ENL teaching  strategies and materials.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  At our weekly ENL meetings, our ENL supervisor, literacy coach and the ENL staff work together to inform the school  community as well as to update and adjust our programs. We try to structure our program so that the needs of the ELLs are  addressed properly.  In addition, information is disseminated at each grade level meeting is shared by the ENL teacher  responsible for those grades.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    ELL students are intentionally placed into one of two ENL classes on the grade.  These classes are not self-contained  but rather classes that contain ELLs as well as English proficient students.  In this way, students have the benefit of  working with others who are proficient in English as well as students who may be able to help them clarify ideas in  their native language.  Students who have scored at the Entering or Emerging levels are grouped together by grade in  a pull-out model to hone in on their foundational skills. Our school has purchased a Language Proficiency Program  (Language Power, Level A) that is tailored to Beginner ELLs in grades K-8.  This helps us maintain uniformity and  consistency, to help students acquire the basic language skills. ELL students are intentionally placed into one of two  ENL classes on the grade.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The mandated number of instructional minutes provided to ELLs as per their proficiency levels is ensured primarily  through scheduling the required numbers of classes for each ELL.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    Content area instructions are delivered primarily through the integrated ENL model by scaffolding the teacher's lesson of the  content area and pre-teaching the vocabulary needed to comprehend the lesson.  English is the language of instruction,  teachers use scaffolding such as videos, realia, TPR, language experience approach as well as explicit instruction.      4.

Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status                    Our ELLs receive instruction in all scenarios primarily using English, although teachers provide Native language  support whenever possible.  The students, who have a strong foundation in their first language, are also provided with dual  language glossaries. Our ENL teachers use a rich blend of various approaches such as TPR, realia, language learning experience,  communicative approach as well as the IRLA during English Language Arts.  Our school uses the freestanding ESL program,  where Ells work with TESOL teachers towards attaining proficiency in English.  Once our Ells attain proficiency, we provide  extra support through our Academic Intervention Services Team.  Former Ells continue to receive two periods of instructional  support from our ENL teachers.                 We have also implemented a program called, Imagine Learning English with all of our kindergarten,  newcomer,  emerging and entering students, as well as our SIFE students. This computer based program is highly  individualized and rich in visual graphics.  It sets the pace according to the needs of the students as well as provides verbal  scaffolds in the Native language. Students are provided with worksheets to reinforce the skills taught through this program.  Supervisors and teachers are able to monitor progress through individualized reports and use the data to drive instruction.                  Long term ELLs are offered the opportunity to participate in various interventions throughout the school year.  Our  interventions focus on literacy, ESL and math, as well as prepare the students for the NYSESLAT and the English Language Arts  and Math Exams.  The ENL After-School  program is designed to target instruction addressing all four modalities with  differentiated instruction for our Expanding ELLs.  Language Power (Level C) is the intervention program we are currently  using, in addition to Brainpop.com during these sessions.  This is an interactive computer program that is appropriate for all  levels and has a variety of activities to enhance Ells’ vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading comprehension, and writing  skills.   Our Saturday ENL Program is tailored for our Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ELLs.  Students use fundations, 100  Book Challenge materials, foundational tool kits, Words Their Way for ELLs (grades 3-4) and Vocabulary Links (grades5-8) as  well as our technology component Imagine Learning English and Brainpop.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           A variety of instructional strategies and grade level materials are used by the teachers of ELL-SWDs.  Some of these  strategies and materials include L1 textbooks, 100 Book Challenge leveled books in English as well as Spanish, ILE (Imagine  Learning English), and content area push-in supporting and scaffolding ELL-SWDs.  ELL-SWDs participate in all activities within  the least restrictive environment.  First, our school uses Smart Boards to  enhance visual, auditory and interactive  learning.  Secondly, these students are also invited to attend our ENL After-school Program and ENL Saturday Program , where  their specific needs are met in smaller groups.  Thirdly, Brainpopesl, a web-based ESL program, is used to help ELL-SWDs  acquire the important elements of ESL, such as speaking, listening, and reading.  In addition, CTT and SETTS instruction helps  prepare our ELL-SWDs.          7.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   N/A      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      Imagine Learning English gives all ELLs a pre-test to identify their abilities in terms of knowledge and language  development.  Based on this information the ILE program selects the set of instructions tailored to their needs.  Baseline  testing also allows us to assess a student's foundational knowledge in terms of content area in relation to their grade/age.  For  those students whose reading/phonics levels are below grade,  we implement Fundations/Wilson Programs to bring them up  to grade level.  Our 100 Book challenge/ IRLA reading assessment allows all ELLs to read at their proper reading level with age appropriate  content.  Our Saturday program uses fiction and non-fiction texts to allow students to grasp content within their targeted  levels.       15.

The purpose of this professional development is to inform and familiarize the staff with the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         methodologies and tools so that teachers can help the ELLs move toward proficiency in English.  TESOL teachers and classroom  teachers utilize this time to collaborate,  review data to tailor instruction to the needs of the students, and receive training and  support in the Common Core Learning Standards. The professional development sessions take place every Monday,  in  addition to full day staff development P.D.  These sessions engage teachers in hands-on preparation of Ready Gen,  Expeditionary Learning, Go Math, Glencoe and CMP3 programs. Professional Development activities are designed for our  target audience, content area, AIS and TESOL teachers, to assess data , identify individual strengths and weaknesses and  project future goals that will be utilized in the differentiation of instructions. Many of the sessions that have already taken  place gave us the opportunity to norm the Measures of Student Learning Performance (MOSL).  These pre-assessments help us  to drive instruction and help students succeed in the challenges that CCLS presents.  The American Reading Company has been  coaching the staff since September 2011 by providing PDs with the Action 100 reading program.  In addition, Professional  Development on differentiation, behavior modifications, questioning techniques and computer science are given throughout  the year. Since all teachers in our school affect the learning outcomes of ELLs, we conduct workshops that include all  pedagogues.These PD's are rotated throughout the year so that all teachers have the opportunity to enhance their learning  and experience.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    see number 1 above.    In order for accurate records to be kept teachers are asked to sign in at all PDs.  In addition, teachers are individually  responsible to keep track of their hours using agendas.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?               The PTA led by the Parent Coordinator invites and encourages parents to participate in various workshops, which are  conducted throughout the year.  These workshops involve them meaningfully, and facilitate community relations as well as  learning related activities at the school.  Parent Workshops cover a wide range of topics such as 'How the Common Core will  affect your Child', Community Awareness, Action 100- How to help your child become a better reader, and How to help  prepare your child for the ELA and Math Exams.  All the parent related information is communicated in children's home  languages.  All fliers are sent home in the native language, informing the parents that interpreters are available from our  Learning Leader Program to help them understand the information delivered.   All workshops have translators on hand to  assist the non-English speaking parents.             Also, each June we hold an orientation for all incoming Kindergarten students and parents.  This orientation helps  familiarize both parents and students with academic expectations as well as ease their anxieties.  Parents are given an  overview of the new Common Core Curriculum, supply list and programs offered to Ells as well as a tour of the building.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school.

Parent Involvement at PS/MS 194 starts in the very first month of the school year.  “Meet the Teacher Night” has become a  tradition at our school. This is when parents are invited to meet all of their child’s teachers, including ENL instructors.  At this  meeting they hear about all the planned and scheduled learning assignments/activities for the school year.    In addition, the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         PTA led by the Parent Coordinator invites and encourages parents to participate in various workshops, which are conducted  throughout the year.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/MS 194                                                                              School DBN: 11x194  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
