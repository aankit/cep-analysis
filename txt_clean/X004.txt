This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our goal at PS/MS 4 is to create a culture of self-reflective scholars who use learning opportunities to develop a global  awareness of the world. As aligned with District 9 goals, our school strives to provide a rigorous, student-centered  approach to teaching and learning that is responsive to the intellectual, developmental, social, and cultural needs of  all learners. Our school's current focus is promoting student engagement via questioning and discussion techniques.  In order to support this approach to student-centered learning, we will support educators with strategies and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      expectations that embody the elements of the District 9 P.R.I.D.E. theory of action: Pupil-centered pedagogy and  content which are Responsive and Rigorous, Interactive, Diverse and Engaging; resulting in improved learning  outcomes for all students.      As aligned with District 9 CEP goals, PS/MS 4 will provide teacher training to support discussion and improved teacher  practice in Components 3b and 3c of the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Further to this, PS/MS 4 will support  professional learning through NTC and Teacher Rounds. Administrators will provide actionable and constructive  feedback to teachers to support student engagement via questioning and discussion techniques.    Further to this, PS/MS 4 will work to provide opportunities to engage families in an effort to support the social  emotional development of our scholars.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/MS 4 is a school focused on the development of the “whole child.” As a result, we have been committed to  providing intensive counseling and at-risk services to our scholars. Additionally, we departmentalize across grades 3-8  in order to expose our scholars to teaching experts in each subject area. Further to this, we believe in small group  instruction to meet the individualized needs of our scholars.    Our community is also focused on cultivating and developing the potential demonstrated by our students, teachers  and administrators by continuously seeking leadership opportunities that will promote their growth. These  opportunities include but not limited to the following:    ● Athletic Teams across the grades 5-8, specifically, our boys and girls basketball teams coached by our teachers   ● Broadway Junior Drama and Arts Program that is fundamentally driven by our students on grades 3 through 8.    ● The Student Ambassador Leadership Program centered on cultivating young leaders in the middle school in addition  to the Peer Collaborate Group and Leader in Me programs   ● The implementation of committees that provide teachers with the opportunity to lead the development of  curriculum, teacher teams, staff hiring selection, intervention and enrichment programs as well as professional  development to include our school-wide POD inter-visitation program   ● Partnerships with college institutions such as Bank Street College that provided our teachers with opportunities to  enter programs in order to pursue educational leadership.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Currently, 45% of our student population resides in temporary housing. In order to meet the social emotional needs  of this population, we employ additional social workers and deans to provide these supports. In addition, our special  student population needs additional mental health counseling, assistance with clothing and additional educational  resources.       4.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After analyzing data from the school’s 2014-2015 Quality Review Report as well as ELA assessment data from the  2016-2017 school year, it is determined that a large percentage of students at PS/MS 4 are still not scoring Level 3s  and 4s on the NYS ELA exam, specifically Special Education and ENL students. In addition, the Quality Review included  the following feedback:   ● While a majority of classrooms have strong pedagogical practices, there are still some classrooms that have  inconsistent practice around extensions for advanced learners. As a result, high levels of thinking and ownership for  some students are not evident in all classrooms.    Although PS/MS 4 has made significant progress relative to this element as compared with other schools in the  district, the closure of the achievement gap in the area of Reading and embedding rigor via the incorporation of  quality tasks and questioning & discussion techniques are determined to be priority needs.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Non-English  speaking  parents   October  2018-March  2019   ENL Teacher, Parent  Coordinator   In an effort to celebrate the academic, social and  emotional success of our students we will apprise our  families of this information via “Tell All Be All” post cards  whereby teachers highlight the recent achievements of  scholars. In addition, at the close of each unit of study, the  school will mail personal invitations encouraging parents  to attend their child’s celebration in order to share their in  the acknowledgement of student culminating work  products.   To ensure consistent as well as transparent  communication with our parents regarding their child’s  academic progress, we will distribute progress reports  every four weeks. Further to this, we will schedule  conferences with parents in order to discuss their child’s  interim progress. Within these conferences as well as  those dedicated to discuss student report cards, parents  and teachers will devise shared goals that will  memorialize the efforts that will be made both at school  and at home to ensure their child’s academic success.   Throughout the school year, the Peer Group Collaborative  Program will be implemented as a means to support the  sixth grade’s transition into Middle School. In order to  inform the parents of the program as well as to showcase  the collaboration between our scholars, teachers and  community we will host several student-led family nights  throughout the school year.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/MS 4, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS/MS 4 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   ● providing ENL classes to parents to assist with their acquisition of the English language   ● organizing a book giveaway, coat and food drive especially for parents residing in temporary housing   The school’s Parent Involvement program will strive to increase parental involvement by 10% as measured by  attendance at workshops and parent events.       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ●  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The after-school instructional  program will service Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ENL students on grades 3, 4 and 5  within the '18-'19  and the '19-'20 school year.  This targeted ELL program will begin in January  9, 2019 and end in May 2, 2019, and on January 8, 2020 until May 6, 2020 with an approximate  duration of 17 weeks. It will run twice per week (Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30-4:30 in  order to provide our students with access to ELA instruction.  This instruction will be derived  from bi-weekly assessments in ELA , which indicate skills in need of improvement.  These  instructional sessions will be conducted by one content area teacher and one ENL teacher.  The  content area teacher will provide direct instruction while the ESL instructor rotates between each  small group, providing small group support to our ENLs throughout each instructional  session.  We will strategically target these students so that they may improve their English  language proficiency through content and skill based instruction.  For home language supports,  students will be assigned readings to practice fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension at home.  Through the use of varied teaching strategies we will address comprehension, vocabulary,  fluency, speaking, and listening skills.  We aim to improve student performance in terms of  incremental progress.  It is evident that while our students are strengthening their literacy skills,  English proficiency has proved difficult to attain.  As a result, students will delve into the content  by reading for information and discussion.  These students will demonstrate mastery by  answering text dependent questions, engaging in discussion, developing short response answers,  and constructing meaning by engaging in close reading activities.  These sessions will focus on  reading for comprehension and the discussion of varying concepts in literature.  In addition, each  child will read texts according to their reading level as well as the content and skill in focus.  As  students encounter these texts, they will be continually assessed to determine the appropriate  level for  instruction.  The materials that will be utilized throughout the duration of this program  will be supplemental skill based texts aligned to standards and will be purchased and developed  using Title III funding.  These resources will prepare our students to engage in the analysis of  literature.  Daily attendance will be recorded and housed in the main office. School staff will call  students who are absent and use translation services to notify parents in their preferred  language.

Title III funding will be utilized to cover a portion of  these sessions, specifically $12,366.00 These sessions will focus on the acquisition of the  English language via reading, writing and speaking skills.  The curriculum resources will be  developed by one ESL teacher and one content area teacher during September of 2019 and  September of 2020 via the Curriculum team. The ESL teacher will use translation services to  communicate parents in their home language. Some workshops which will be developed include  "ELL Parent Meeting," "Tips for Helping Your Child Read at Home," "Understanding the  Curriculum." Resources such as newsletters, letters and fliers will be used to notify parents of  these activities.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Fountas and Pinnell is the instructional tool that serves to inform both daily instruction as well as the instructional program of  our school.  The data collected varies across the grade levels as each child is assessed via individualized running records to  determine reading and comprehension levels.  Once the data is assessed, we utilize the American Reading Framework to  identify the necessary skills and strategies students must possess in order to make significant gains across reading levels.  Based on the analysis of current data, our students across grades Pre-K to 8th engage in the decoding process with limited  difficulty, but struggle to comprehend texts of varying text complexity.  When analyzing responses to literature, major  components such as themes, interpretation of actions of the characters and their development over the course of a text are  difficult concepts to understand. Additionally, students struggle to identify relevant information via text-based details.  Further  to this, drawing appropriate conclusions as well as inferences is a significant challenge.  Therefore, our instructional programs  addresses skills such as main idea, thematic connections, drawing conclusions and making inferences across the genres.  We   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      have also modified our scheduling program to provide 90 minute blocks of reading and writing instruction so that students  have more opportunities to acquire the necessary skills to increase comprehension.                  2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our ELA and ENL teachers follow the Literacy Framework for Great Classrooms which allocates three days for reading lessons  and two days for writing lessons on a weekly basis.  In addition, built in to each 90 minute block of time is a Guided Reading or  Independent Reading conferencing session which is 25 minutes of each instructional block.  The school has purchased and  distributed additional books to be used during Guided Reading and independent reading sessions.  Grades K-6 also have  additional (ARC) independent reading periods built into their schedule. During this time, teachers are expected to conference  with students regarding their independent reading books.  They are also expected to be assessing them on their reading  fluency and comprehension to determine whether they have reached a higher reading level using the American Reading  Framework.  The teachers  then input the data collected during conference into the School Pace system which is used to track  progress.  Administrators are required to review School Pace data with the teachers that they supervise in order to monitor  compliance and progress.  There is an incentive program and award ceremony to acknowledge the students who have made  the most progress when it comes to independent reading.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by utilizing assessments.  Devising ELA, Math and content area assessments  and analyzing the data generated helps to guide our instructional decision-making.  The progress of ELLs will be monitored  throughout the year using assessment tools such as the ELL Periodic Assessments, Fountas & Pinnell, simulations, teacher  tests, observations, portfolios, and student work.  This will also help us determine if our instructional decisions are beneficial  for our English Language Learners.    In our school we have a Freestanding ENL Program; therefore, the tests are in English. However, the newcomer students are  taught throughout the year with side-by-side translations, and that group is exempt from the ELA assessment.  The results  further show that the ELLs are progressing about the same as the mainstream English students. The majority of our students  fall into Level 2 in ELA and in Math, the same as the general education students.  The results of the ELL Periodic Assessments are used to develop professional development opportunities for teachers and to  help teachers plan their units and day-to-day lessons. The implication of the data demonstrates that data needs to drive our  instruction.  In our school we are currently using data to develop the professional development.  In regards to the native  language, we need to assess the students more thoroughly to get an accurate reading of how the native language affects their  learning. The newcomers in our school can provide us with this information.   ELLs are targeted within ELA, Math and other content areas through differentiated instruction and the use of technology.  Each  instructional period incorporates lessons to scaffold and target modeling skills through the use of visual aids.  In addition,  differentiated tasks are designed by ability level.  Multiple lessons throughout each week integrate the use of technology  through modeling and guided practice.  Further to this, students utilize multiple systems to evidence their overall  understanding of concepts in all literacy, math and content areas.  These systems include reading response journals, writer’s  and vocabulary notebooks.  Conferencing within each instructional period also addresses individual as well as group needs.       Additionally, as teachers are observed via the Danielson's rubric, we are able to assess the instructional successes of our  teachers and how the methodologies impact their student learning.  It is then at the debrief conference where we are able to  cite pedagogical next steps that will directly impact student achievement ultimately promoting the success of our ELL  program.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The data from summative assessments are compiled centrally by a community associate in conjunction with the  administration.  Once the data is disaggregated, it is distributed to teachers in regards to their respective  students.  Administrators then review the data with teachers to identify targeted interventions for individual students.  They  are also reviewing the curriculum and lesson plans to identify possible modifications that will address the needs of the ENL  population.  These modifications will include the use of visual aids, and the creation of differentiated tasks that designed by  ability.  In addition, ENL Teachers are expected to review the summative data with the Subject Area Teachers to decide on next  steps for instruction.  During these conferences ENL teachers, Subject Area Teachers work together to decide on how to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         differentiate individual tasks and offer additional supports.  Future summative teacher-created assessments are developed  collaboratively and submitted for review to the administrative team.  The administrative team then provides the teachers with  feedback before the exam is administered.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Data is used strategically to deliver instruction to individuals as well as within small group settings.  Individual instruction is  facilitated through reading, writing and math conferences. Small group instruction is designed to provide strategy lessons for  those students performing similar with respect to literacy and math concepts. Assessments are administered in mathematics  on a weekly basis and literacy assessments are conducted after every 5 lessons to determine the immediate proficiency levels  of our students.  Specifically, our students are tested on the English proficiency through literature based assessments  throughout each unit.   Our Monday data meetings are utilize disaggregated data and to develop focus areas for re-teach  lessons and to design action plans for students who require additional individualized instruction and/or support.  The data  collected from each assessment is used to tier each student.  It is this assessed data that is used by teachers and members of  the RTI team to determine intervention services necessary to aid in the academic progress of students.  Additionally, the data  collected from the each content area assessment to include Science and Social Studies is used to develop re-teach lessons for  individuals, small and whole groups of students.  Further to this, students self assess and analyze their performance on tasks  during designated data periods.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the data, it’s evident that our ELL population has increased.  Further to this, the new admission of ELLs are limited  speakers and/or non speakers of English across grades K-8. As a result, forty-six out seventy-eight of our ELLs are currently  between the Entering or Emerging stages across grades K-8 which requires our instruction to be literacy based in order to  address content, skill, language acquisition in an effort to increase the fluency of literacy in all content areas.  Additionally, via  our school's instructional focus, specifically, student engagement via questioning and discussion techniques we are promoting  discourse in all grade levels in order to increase our students speaking and listening skills.  Lastly, there are nineteen ELLs in the  expanding stage across grades K-8.  As a result, we have developed thematic units of study, which integrate content area  reading and discourse into each lesson. Additionally, additionally each lesson outlines the tools needed to support our  ELLs.  Throughout these units, we provide our students with the exposure and ability to engage in literature based on their  instructional needs as well as guided sessions to they are able to continue to advance throughout this stage.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The administrative team conducts cabinet meetings to discuss any findings related to the formative and summative data that  has been collected regarding our ELL population.  This includes teacher-created, school-wide and NYS assessments.  The  findings determined by a review of this data are shared with teachers through professional development, consultations with  consultants and individual conferences with administrator.  Based our findings from the 2016-2017 school year, we decided  the Language Power curriculum into our ENL program to better structure and enhance our  ENL  stand-alone instruction.  Our  ENL teachers, Subject Area teachers and an administrator attended training on using the Language Power curriculum during  the month of June 2017.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The following information demonstrates how we services our ELLs:  Entering:  We provide 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 integrated of ENL/ELA.  Emerging:  We provide 90 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 integrated of ENL/ELA.  Transitioning:  We provide 180 minutes of ENL/ELA.  Expanding:  We provide 180 of ENL/ELA.  Commanding:  We provide 90 minutes of ENL/ELA.  The aforementioned services are provided by the ENL teachers in integrated and stand alone program.  Students are  grouped heterogeneously.  ENL instruction via the stand alone and integrated model is planned according to the literacy units of study adopted  by the school on all grades.  For example, specific grades are studying sea life, forensic anthropology and global  warming during the months of September and October.  These types of thematic units will be in focus throughout the  school year.  As a result, the thematic units will encourage our ELLs to make connections and explore relevant and  thought provoking content.  Additionally we provide Spanish to English dictionaries in the classroom. These thematic  units provide the content of instruction whereas the ELL teacher must identify appropriate teaching strategies to  deliver instruction.  These strategies and the manner in which to deliver the content is based upon the assessed needs  of the students.  The data is derived from weekly ELA and vocabulary quizzes as well as from documented  conferences and observations.  The organizational model utilized at PS/MS 4 includes the integrated and stand alone  model of instruction.  All integrated and stand alone sessions are of mixed proficiency levels with ELLs on the same  grade level.  These sessions provide students with exposure to learning the new language and the content as  well.  ENL teachers also plan in collaboration with the ELA department to ensure that the instructional content is in  alignment with the curriculum.  These planning sessions allow teachers to ensure the differentiation of materials and  the scaffolding of direct instruction.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              As the proficiency level of ELLs is determined, instructional minutes via each program model are delivered.  The stand  alone ENL and integrated ENL models according to the stipulated instructional minutes are provided according to the  proficiency levels below on a weekly basis:  Entering: 1 unit of study of 180 minutes in ENL and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA (180 minutes)  Emerging: .5 unit of study of 90 minutes in ENL and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA and/or .5 stand alone or integrated  Transitioning: .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA or 90 minutes and/or .5 stand alone or integrated  Expanding: 1 unit of study in ELA/ENL or a content area  Commanding: .5 unit of study of 90 minutes integrated ENL in ELA or content area.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In an effort to provide literacy as well as content based instruction, we have devised thematic units of study that  incorporates social studies as well as science.  Additionally, our instructional program builds in vocabulary as an individual  instructional period whereby teachers are able to teach students content specific words that are extracted from familiar as  well as literature relevant to their current unit of study.  An array of literature is also selected to support these thematic units  so that children are able to read, debate, engage in discussions, conduct research, develop essays as well as written responses  to literature.  The common core standards are addressed via the assessments that drive our curriculum, the curriculum that  drives daily lesson plans, and the analysis of data that helps to differentiate instruction as per the needs of our children in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      accordance with the standards.  The resources used to support our ELLs are school based units of study that address all sub  groups, leveled literature aligned to students' assessed needs (American Reading Company libraries), scholastic On the Go  Math, Science and Social Studies libraries. Additional literature is purchased for each ELA unit of study and is aligned to the  content of the unit as well as each child's reading level.    An instructional method used is sheltered English where teachers use clear, direct, simple English and a wide range of  scaffolding strategies to communicate meaningful input in the content area to students. They develop learning activities that  connect new content to students' prior knowledge and that require collaboration among students, which spirals through  curriculum material.  Each lesson developed is aligned to the language needs of each child and it is also aligned to the common  core learning standards.  In order to build ELL proficiency, ENL teachers integrate reading, writing, speaking and listening  activities in order to address the needs of students as well as to meet the standards.  ENL teachers also provide support by  translating materials as needed, visual aides as well as progressing from letter and sound recognition to simple words and  sentences in order to construct meaningful written products.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      For ELLs, specifically new comers, it is essential that they receive individualized support as well as small group instruction.  In  these cases, we provide ENL instruction in addition to AIS services which provides children with additional language  reinforcement.  Further to this, we are able to incorporate conferencing into the daily instruction of ELLs in order to sustain  individualized instruction.  Weekly assessments are also administered and analyzed in order to develop comprehensive lessons  that are aligned to current data.  As data is continuously collected, to include letter, sound, word and content based  information teachers refine their lessons to directly support the needs of their students.  This focus on vocabulary, content,  and literacy provides our newcomers with the scaffolding needed to ease the transition into formal assessments such as the  NYS ELA.  Furthermore, these students are placed in classes with teachers who are proficient in Spanish so that they assist  children with translation.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiating instruction is the foundation for exemplary teaching.  As such the following methods are implemented to  address the needs of newcomers, ELLs (4-6), long term ELLs and former ELLs:   *Exposure to a rigorous ELA curriculum that is literature based as well as interdiscipinary  *The desegregation of data in order to make instructional decisions to meet the language needs for all their students.    *Making data driven decisions to include the formulation of small group instruction, individualized conferencing, guided  reading sessions and strategy lessons.  Additionally, literature to include genre, interest-based and leveled texts are accessible  to all children via classroom libraries to support language development.  Located in these libraries are varied dictionaries and  vocabulary notebooks that evidence their knowledge of new words over time.  *The development of heterogeneous and homogeneous integrated services based on need and assessed ability  * The development and use of instructional systems to provide multiple access points such as math logs, reading response  journals, vocabulary and writers notebooks.    *Extended day small group sessions focused on the reading of literature, book discussions, accountable talk and the  advancement of comprehension skills via Bloom's Taxonomy.  Teachers develop lessons to include responses to literature,  reading and listening to texts and answering questions to demonstrate their understanding.     Our instructional plan for all ELLs spanning from newcomers to former ELLs is to provide tailored instruction based on the  identified needs of students.  The analysis of data is key.  Combining NYSESLAT data along with our ELA in -house assessment  data we will provide rigorous instruction while tailoring materials and resources to meet their needs.   Differentiation for each proficiency level of ELLs includes but is not limited to the following:  New Comers ELLs:   Letter and sound identification activities  Labeling in order to formulate simple sentences   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Read aloud to discuss story and word patterns   Picture and word association   Reading and tracking of simple sentences within texts  Partner reading and discussion of story elements  Developing ELLs:  Oral and written presentations in all content areas  Fluency packets to address decoding and comprehension  Multiple resources within each task in order to scaffold(moving from visual to graphic organizers to short response questions)   Vocabulary focus using frayer model  Long term ELLs/SIFE:  Assessments to determine source impeding comprehension: sight word recognition, vocabulary knowledge, decoding, fluency  Comprehension targeted questions (recall to text based evidence to open ended responses)  One to one conferencing and targeted intervention  Small group instruction with mixed tiers  Testing Accommodations for ELLs and former ELLs  Time extensions on all assessments   Separate locations  Dictionary and glossary use  Oral Translations      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs-SWDs receive ENL as well as their mandated IEP services.  Our SBST along with the Spec. Ed and ELL Assistant Principals  ensure that all mandates are met in accordance with all IEPs.  These efforts are evidenced by schedules and instructional  programming built around student mandated services.  However, in addition to these services, each classroom is supported by  a paraprofessional.  These paraprofessionals provide one to one instruction, small group instruction, and one to one  conferencing.  Materials and resources are acquired are based on the assessed individual performance of students.  Our  libraries include literature spanning kindergarten to eighth grade texts in all 3-8 classrooms.  Our K-2 classrooms have libraries  that have literature from K-3 grade.  This span of literature is based on the reading levels of our children to ensure access to  appropriate reading materials that will help promote ad excel their language development.  The classrooms have been suited  with computers and smart boards.  These technological tools help to facilitate the research process and provide the visual aids  necessary to facilitate the comprehension of literacy and content area concepts.  These students, although in bridge classes  also receive mathematics instruction according to their grade level.  Furthermore, paraprofessionals are assigned to specific  classes to provide direct instruction via small group.  Materials used in sub-groups are designed by the classroom and ENL  teachers as they assess their students to determine their needs and adapt their materials accordingly.  In order to ensure ELL  SWDs receive mandated bilingual instruction, we assign bilingual paraprofessionals as well as the services of the ENL  teacher.                    7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain  English proficiency within the least restrictive environment by identifying the instructional periods that can be used for stand  alone and integrated ENL.  We assess our student's language proficiency level, group them accordingly and provide  instructional support to not only attain the goals outlined in their IEP, but also their language goals.  ELL-SWDs are  continuously assessed as are our general education ELLs in  order to adjust their schedule, instructional and curricular  materials to provide needs based instruction.  Ultimately, students' IEPs are reviewed, data is collected and meetings are held  to discuss each ELL SWDs progress to determine their ICT placement. We ensure that each placement is based on the assessed  needs of our students.  All students are invited to attend our after school programs focusing on literacy, mathematics and content areas  instruction.  Materials are skill based and accommodate the needs of all learners to include ELLs with Special needs as the  textual information is based on academic levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      SIFE students are involved in our after school program as well. Further to this, we have classroom libraries that include high  interest texts that span reading levels so that students can easily access and comprehend the content.  Students also receive  literature based instruction via book clubs and guided reading.  This instruction helps to increase oral presentation skills as well  as comprehension of a variety of genres.  Sentence starters, grammar instruction, literacy centers, and the use of technology  provides students with many opportunities to build their skills specific to listening, speaking, reading and writing.      All of our enrichment and after school programs serve all of our populations thereby increasing the opportunities for children  to be exposed to various teaching styles and learning communities.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention programs include intensive instructional sessions during recess from the school's daily instruction.  Additionally,  after school programs are also utilized to support the instruction of ELLs. Across the content areas ELLs are afforded many  opportunities for learning. In ELA, classrooms include thematic libraries, dictionaries and literacy centers.  The following  materials are used to provide instruction services: Wilson program (ELLs-SWDs), portfolios, writers notebooks, readers  notebooks, conferencing, technology and differentiated small group instruction.  In Math, glossaries, leveled workbooks, leveled worksheets, conferencing, technology and small group instruction are used to  provide intervention services.    Native language is addressed by strategically placing support paraprofessionals and/or teachers with our students.  Based on  the native language of our students, we identify support paraprofessionals that can provide translation and can help teachers  to modify tasks.  Additionally, tasks and reading materials are translated in order to provide access to all learners.   Our content area instructional program provides for 5-10 small group instruction periods per week.  This signifies that our 3  Science teachers and our 3 Social Studies teachers each serve small groups of students in addition to their core classes.  This  program model is to further support our students who require intervention services.  The data used to formulate groups as  well as to design lessons is the NYSESLAT reports as well as bi-weekly ELA assessments to determine academic tiers and proper  methods of instructional delivery.         According to our curriculum, standards are identified, taught and assessed to determine student proficiency.  As a result, we  are able to determine what skills and/or standards must be re-taught.  Additionally, we maintain a data system which tracks  student performance for each exam so that teachers are able to assess the methodologies used to teach skills and/or  standards.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      As a result of numerous surveys and needs assessment meetings, our educational community identified that our curriculum  had to be revised to address our sub groups, specifically, ELLs, SWDs as well as advanced learners. In this regard, we modified  our curriculum units in order to address all learners.  With these new modifications, we are able to use strategically pre- planned and pre-constructed resources specific to their learning needs to ensure access to content.  Additionally, in order to  increase discourse and use of content specific language, our school based instructional goal is student engagement via  questioning and discussion techniques.  To support this initiative, we are delving into the practices of Depth of Knowledge as  well as Bloom's Taxonomy in order to devise complex tasks as well as to develop questions based on the content introduced  throughout each lesson.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  PS/MS 4 encourages all students to participate in our after school programs.  ELLs are not only classified by this sub group label  but also by tier level based on the collection of on-going data in all content areas.  In this regard, students are selected and  afforded the same opportunity to access all programs because outreach is conducted to ensure all students participate.  As a  result, we conduct a comprehensive campaign to include personal phone calls to parents, mass calls, flyer's, and class by class  presentations.   All students to include ELLs are afforded an opportunity to be included in the instructional after school  programs offered at PS/MS 4.  In addition, 21st century and Phipps provide all students with extra-curricular services such as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      cheer leading, basketball, and poetry club.

What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials that are used to support ELLs are the implementation of balanced literacy and balanced math  instruction, 90 minute blocks of reading, writing and math, thematic libraries, grammar and phonics books.  Further to this, all  students have access to classroom computers and to smart boards as each classroom is outfitted with this  technology.  Materials used for subgroups in all classrooms as well as content areas are as follows:  *Leveled literature  *Thesaurus   *Dictionaries  *Glossaries  *Bilingual dictionaries  *Graphic organizers  *Visual aides to include comic strips, pattern texts, video presentations   *Translated passages, texts, and assessments       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our ENL program is distinct, home language support is provided by assigning native language paraprofessionals to help  students in the acquisition of new language.  Native language support is also delivered via access to literature.  Each classroom  has extensive libraries that help to promote the love of reading as well as language development        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All resources and support services correposnd to the ages and grade levels of students.  Leveled texts, testing materials as well  as thematic library books are purchased so that children can easily access reading books.  Students' IEPs are reviewed in order  to ensure our services address current academic needs as well as the services outlined in their IEP.  Additionally, data is  continuously collected to ensure that teachers are modifying lessons as well as developing appropriate lessons and resources  specific to small groups.  As students progress in their mastery of the standards, classroom teachers, SETTS teacher, Ms.  Munch Buckley as well as ENL teachers, Ms. Cohen and Ms. Jackson modify resources and instruction to address the students'  current cognitive and language needs.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The instructional materials that are used to support ELLs are the implementation of balanced literacy and balanced math  instruction, 90 minute blocks of reading, writing and math, thematic libraries, grammar and phonics books.  Further to this, all  students have access to classroom computers and to smart boards as each classroom is outfitted with this  technology.  Materials used for subgroups in all classrooms as well as content areas are as follows:  *leveled literature   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      *Thesaurus   *Dictionaries  *Glossaries  *Bilingual dictionaries  *Graphic organizers  *Visual aides to include comic strips, pattern texts, video presentations   *Translated passages, texts, and assessments       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students who enroll throughout the school year are assessed so as to determine proficiency levels and academic supports  need for individualized as well as group instruction.  Each child is assigned a cohort that receives ENL instruction according to  their proficiency level.  Additionally, PS/MS 4 has instituted a reading framework, titled, ARC in order to assess and provide our  students with literature that correlates to their independent reading level. Throughout the year, students are assessed via  Fountas and Pinnell to determine reading levels and to assist students in the development of language and of  comprehension.  Lastly, students engage in daily conference sessions around these assessed levels where they receive  instruction based on the skills and strategies to help them make continuous improvement.  As new ELLs are admitted, they  engage in meet and greet sessions with their classroom teachers as well as the ENL teachers, Ms. Cohen and Ms.  Jackson.  Further to this, all students meet our support staff to include our Deans and Social Workers in order to ease their  transition into their new school.  This process enables our children to always have a staff member they feel comfortable talking  to if and when they struggle academically and/or socially.  The members of our support include the following persons:  Ms. Cohen, ENL teacher  Ms. Jackson, ENL teacher  Mr. Abarca, K-2 Dean  Ms. Litvak, K-2 Social Worker  Ms. Jones, 3-5 Social Worker  Ms. Kim, 6-8 Dean  Ms. Perez, 6-8 Social Worker  Ms. McGann, 6-8  Guidance Counselor     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    n/a      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is offered on a monthly and weekly basis at PS/MS 4.  All APs, ENL, ELA, Math, Special Ed. and  content area teachers to include paraprofessionals engage in Monday planning sessions where assessments are analyzed in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      order to make decisions around instructional programming and curriculum. Additionally, this time will be dedicated to  trainings on teaching methods and strategies as well as differentiating instruction to meet the needs of all learners.  All PD  sessions target CCLS and they are aligned to best teaching practices in order to support their implementation of inter- disciplinary curriculum.

Additionally, teachers are sent to outside PD in order to receive ENL specific strategies to improve the acquisition  of language.  As we deliver professional development, we embed and address the CCLS by developing tasks and  lessons.  Additionally, our data sessions involve the analysis of content area assessments that are aligned to the standards so  that student mastery and the development of subsequent plans to address their needs is tracked.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional development is provided to address this transition.  The ENL teachers work with our guidance counselors and  social workers to describe the transition process in order to support our scholars. Additionally, we have forged a relationship  with an ELL High School and have scheduled meetings to the expectations for students at their school.  In this regard, this  school has come to PS/MS 4 to present in order to describe to our students, teachers and guidance counselors the transition  process as well as the opportunities afforded.      As indicated by the calendar of professional development offerings our teacher are exposed to continuous learning  opportunities.  Each session is monitored by attendance sheets and maintained in the main office binder system in order to  ensure the total number of hours.  This professional development requirement is completed via Monday PDs as well as  trainings offered by DOE.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are continuously invited to participate in school events.  Flyers and letters are translated in order to ensure a  successful outreach.  Phone calls are also translated when necessary.  Parental needs are assessed through the Learning  Environment Survey as well as In-House surveys to determine topics of interest as well as areas of concern.  In addition, we  also target parents by student-performance.  Based on student performance levels, we provide parents with workshops and  informational sessions which target how they can support their children at home.  Parents are involved in many activities throughout the school year to include workshops, parent-teacher conferences, Open  School as well as Curriculum night. Throughout the length of these functions translators are positioned in key areas to facilitate  translation services.  Health First and Saint Barnabas Hospital are the community based organizations that provide workshops  targeting health and family services.  The McKinney-Vento organization offers services to parents that are homeless, displaced  or in temporary housing.  These organizations provide information at our workshops and the community events offered at  PS/MS 4 throughout the school year, specifically our “Bridging the Gap” event. In addition, the CBO, "Leadership," provides  translation services for all parents.  This organization also conducts bilingual workshops on computer and job training,  parenting, and the college process.  Surveys are conducted by bilingual staff in order to provide translation services.   Additional school based activities involving parents are our monthly literacy and math celebrations, poetry slams, school  dances, monthly workshops and fund raising events.       Parent activities include but are not limited to:  *Monthly content-specific workshops  *Parent-Teacher Conferences  *Educational excursions  *Monthly celebrations  Parent needs are evaluated by way of surveys. These surveys are administered several times throughout the year to ensure  that the needs of their families and their children are met.              2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  PS / MS 4 facilitates an after school ENL Adult program that offers English classes for beginners.  Parents are not only learning  the English language but they are also learning strategies to help their children with homework.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maria Villegas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/MS 4                                                                              School DBN: 09x004  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Using the data collected by examining our home language surveys we are able to assess the various written  translation and oral interpretation needs of our student population. In order to execute this process effectively,  we identify a pedagogue to aid the parents in completing the forms appropriately. Once this information is  collected, the process of updating the ATS system can commence. As the current information is placed into the  system, we can accurately assess the ways in which we must communicate with our parents. Parental needs are  assessed through the Learning Environment Survey as well as In-House surveys to determine interpretation needs  as well as areas of interest for parent workshops. In alignment with this process, we identify school personnel to  translate and serve as parent liaisons in order to facilitate the exchange of school and community-based  information. The Parent Coordinator also seeks to provide additional translations through identified resources in a  timely manner so that all pertinent documents are distributed to parents. In addition, the school’s family worker  supports the home-school connection via the translation of all pertinent documents to inform parents and the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      community at large. In this fashion, parents are continuously invited to participate in school events. In order to  facilitate this process, we translate all flyers, and letters. Outreach phone calls are also translated. Parents are  involved in many activities throughout the school year to include workshops, parent-teacher conferences, Open  School Night as well as Curriculum Night. Throughout the length of these functions translators are positioned in  key areas to facilitate translation services. Health First and Saint Barnabas Hospital are the community based  organizations that provide workshops targeting health and family services. These organizations provide  information at our workshops and the community events offered at PS/MS 4 throughout the school year,  specifically our “Bridging the Gap” event. In addition, the CBO, "Leadership," provides translation services for all  parents. This organization also conducts bilingual workshops on computer and job training, parenting, and the  college process.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
