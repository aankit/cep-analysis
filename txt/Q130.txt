Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our mission is to foster a community who works together to overcome limitations to create a welcoming educational 
environment, providing rigorous instruction for all students. We believe all students are capable of achieving 
academic, social, emotional and physical standards of excellence. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 130 opened in September 1987 as the first Early Childhood School in District 25 and now serves 410 students in 
pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. We work to maintain developmentally-appropriate practice while providing 
rigorous instruction guided by the Framework for Great Schools. Our talented and dedicated staff is committed to 
maintaining excellence while continuously striving to find ways to improve practice and support our students.  

Parents and families, core members of our community, frequent our building as they participate in monthly Family 
Reading Buddies, volunteer in classrooms, participate in learning series, and attend celebrations. They serve as 
members on the School Leadership Team, School Safety Team, Building Response Team and Enrichment Committee. 
Most importantly, they are partners in the learning process of their children. Our school website at 
ps130queens.weebly.com serves as a venue for the school community to maintain close communication and stay 
updated on school and classroom events while offering translation of information in many languages. 

Acknowledgement and Honors for P.S. 130: 

In 2011, P.S. 130 was awarded the National Blue Ribbon because of our sustained excellence in academic 
achievements. 

Partnerships include: 

We have established strong partnerships with outside organizations to foster a comprehensive learning experience 
for our community: 

  Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP): 

o  We have been a Project School with the TCRWP at Columbia University for almost two decades. 

Teachers and administrators work alongside staff developers to engage in professional learning to 
plan for rigorous literacy instruction aligned with Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). 

  Algebra for All: This year, we will participate in the Algebra for All Initiative. Our community will investigate 

strategies for rigorous mathematical instruction centered around critical thinking and mathematical 
communication. 

  Magic Box Productions.: 

o  Partnering with Magic Box Productions, teachers and students participate in chorus and recorder 
instruction. Our English as a New Language (ENL) students participate in an after-school program 
which focuses on literacy and language acquisition through the digital arts. 

  Guggenheim Museum, Learning Through Arts: 

o  This extensive arts residency, for 2nd grade students, has teachers and teaching artists collaborating 

to provide visual arts experiences. 

 

Inside Broadway 

o  Our partnership with Inside Broadway allows opportunities for students in Kindergarten and grades 1, 

3, 4, and 5 to participate in a theater program during the day. 

  New York Road Runners (NYRR), Mighty Milers:  

o  Our partnership with NYRR Mighty Milers allows all students in grades 2-5 to participate in a fitness 

program to increase self-esteem and set personal goals for overall health and fitness. Our participants 
receive incentives and rewards for reaching personal and group goals. 

Additional Afterschool Programs include: 

  Queens Theater in the Arts 

o  Through a grant from our Council and Assembly members, we are able to offer an after-school 

theatre program for students. 

  After School Basketball and Cheerleading Program:  

o  Our fourth and fifth graders participate in the District 25 Basketball and Cheerleading Program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

Spanish Immersion Program 

o  This optional program offers conversational language immersion. 

  After School Chess Program 
  After School Test Prep Program for Grades 3-5 
  Best Prep Academy (Community-Based Organization, CBO) 

o  A family-paid, after-school CBO program housed in our building. 

Arts education is essential in the development of our students. Through creative grant writing, PTA contributions, and 
strategic budgeting of school funds, art residencies and programs were established for both during and after the 
school day. The Enrichment Club Program, where students meet by grade level in enrichment clubs of their choice, 
including painting, STEM, cooking, sports, news writing and other interests, continues to prosper. 

We continue to foster our partnership with our local Council and Assembly members who support our initiatives and 
are respected members of our community. We have been the proud recipients of Resolution-A grants from our 
Council members which have enabled us to update our Computer Lab desktops, classroom Smart Boards and laptops 
as well as our online learning resources for students. This year, we will use our Resolution-A grant to support teachers 
and students in the classroom by purchasing new laptops. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P.S. 130 is proud of our diverse population. 21% of our students are English Language Learners (ELL) who benefit from 
explicit instruction in literacy-rich environments. Our Students with Disabilities (SWD), 21.9% of all students, receive 
co-teacher support in our Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes and in our grade 2/3/4 12-1-1 class. Our related service 
providers offer targeted support for students via counseling, occupational therapy, physical therapy, adaptive physical 
education, speech and language, and SETSS. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

  As evidenced on our current Framework for Great Schools report: 

o  98% of parents feel the school has provided them with opportunities for outreach and participation in 
their child's education. Parent Engagement is fostered through many adult learning opportunities and 
the welcoming of parents/guardians to our instructional activities during and after the school day.  

o  We have scored above the city average in all six areas of Rigorous Instruction, Supportive 

Environment, Teacher Collaboration, Family and Community Ties, Effective Leadership and Trust. 
Collaborative Teachers was our area of strength and progress was made in Strong Family-Community 
Ties. Our area of focus for this year is Rigorous Instruction. 

  Our School Survey responses demonstrate positive perceptual data from teachers and families. 

Our 2018-2019 Instructional Focus states:  

P.S. 130 will deepen our understanding and improve our practice of rigorous mathematics instruction by studying the 
standards, and the Mathematical Practices, and planning and executing cognitively-rigorous, student-centered tasks 
thereby supporting students in achieving gains in mathematics. 

Our theory of action is that if we continue to strengthen instruction, implement daily social-emotional practices, and 
utilize formative assessment practices to target students' individual needs and challenge those students who meet or

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The School Leadership Team, and school teams, conducted a comprehensive review of our academic data to prepare 
a needs assessment for our school. 

Data sources included our current Framework for Great Schools Report, 2017-2018 School Survey Report, 2017 School 
Quality Snapshot, 2018 State Test data and the analysis of the 2017-2018 Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) goals 
and action plans. 

  85.5 % of all students met or exceeded standards on the 2018 State Mathematics Test. 
 

In 2017, our SWD and ELL subgroups of students scored at Levels 2 and 3, approaching and meeting 
standards. Progress monitoring for those subgroups is supported via multiple measures including i-Ready 
assessments, Go Math assessments, Great Leaps Math assessments as well as the literacy data available. 

  50% of our Hispanic students met or exceeded standards on the 2018 State Mathematics Test. 

2018 data reveals an achievement gap for our Hispanic Students which will be our target group for intervention. This 
group includes English Language Learners (ELLs), general education and economically-disadvantaged students, 
Students with Disabilities (SWD) and special education students in Integrated Co-teaching Classes. Some students fall 
into more than one subgroup.  

Our school community recognizes that students must make adequate progress in mathematics in order to be 
successful and achieve proficiency with the Common Core Learning Standards, the Next Generation Learning 
Standards - Mathematics, and State Standards. The Standards require a rigorous mathematics curriculum in order to 
prepare students to become college and career ready. All students are required to maintain high academic standards. 
Our Theory of Action is that by supporting teachers in planning and executing rigorous, student-centered math 
lessons, students will benefit with gains in mathematical practices. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will parallel with the district's Rigorous Instruction goal to deepen students' conceptual understanding 
and problem-solving skill, by studying the standards and Mathematical Practices and planning and executing cognitively-

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Students need a supportive environment in order to feel safe and to learn. Danielson's Framework for Teaching, 
Components 2a: Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport, and 2b: Establishing a Culture for Learning, defines 
the criteria and expectations necessary to foster this environment. The School Survey Report offers data around 
Supportive Environment, and The Capacity Framework addresses a supportive environment where trust is embedded 
as a pivotal element for a successful school community. 

Our current School Survey data demonstrates: 

  98.7 % of parents and staff believe that our school community provides a safe and supportive environment  

In March 2017, a Social-Emotional Survey, with a focus on belonging, was administered to students in second and 
third grade and data analysis revealed: 

  89% of Kindergarten students agree with the statement, "I feel like I belong at PS 130." 
  87% of 1st grade students agreed with the statement, “I feel like I belong at P.S. 130.” 
  88% of 2nd grade students agreed with the statement, “I feel like I belong at P.S. 130.” 
  92% of 3rd grade students agreed with the statement, “I feel like I belong at P.S. 130.” 

Following a cohort of students (third graders), the Scholar Centric Resiliency Survey was administered to fourth grade 
students in February 2018. The results indicated that on average, female students scored within the lower percentile 
ranges within the resiliency skills of confidence, connection to teachers, connections to an adult, and health and well-
being.  

Additionally, our areas of most progress were in the resiliency skills as defined by the survey - value of education, 
stress, and health and well-being. Therefore, our school community believes that a goal addressing the skills of 
Academic Confidence, and Intrinsic Motivation, would be appropriate as targets for the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school-wide implementation of Social-Emotional Learning with Collaborative for Academic, Social and 
Emotional Learning (CASEL), RULER and Breathe For Change resources, will result in 50% of students in grades 4 and 5

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The School Leadership Team, and school teams, conducted a comprehensive review of our academic data to prepare 
a needs assessment for our school. 

Data sources included our current Framework for Great Schools Report, 2017-2018 School Survey Report, 2017 School 
Quality Snapshot, 2018 State Test data, 2017-2018 MoSL data and the analysis of the 2017-2018 Comprehensive 
Education Plan (CEP) goals and action plans. 

  70% of students in grades 1 through 3 attained 35 SGP or greater as measured by the 2018 STARS assessment. 
  2018 NYS ELA data, Grade 3, show gains of 10.5% of students meeting or exceeding standards at levels 3 and 

 
 
 

4 for a total of 81.2% meeting or exceeding standards 
in 2018, 71.4% of our SWD subgroup in grade 3 met or exceeded standards  
In 2018, 66.6% of our ELL subgroup in grade 3 met or exceeded standards 
In 2018, our first 4th grade class data shows 72.7% of all students meeting and exceeding standards on the 
NYS ELA Test  

  50% of Hispanics met or exceeded standards on the State ELA test. 
  Progress monitoring for subgroups is supported via multiple measures including IRL levels, STARS assessment 

data, Great Leaps Literacy assessments, LLI and Fundations assessments. 

2018 data reveals an achievement gap for our Hispanic Students which will be our target group for intervention. This 
group includes English Language Learners (ELLs), general education and economically-disadvantaged students, 
Students with Disabilities (SWD) and special education students in Integrated Co-teaching Classes. Some students fall 
into more than one subgroup.  

Our school community recognizes that students must make adequate progress in reading and writing in order to be 
successful and achieve proficiency with the Common Core Learning, the Next Generation Learning Standards - ELA, 
and State Standards. The Standards require a rigorous ELA curriculum in order to prepare students to become college 
and career ready. All students are required to maintain high academic standards. Therefore, our school community 
believes that a goal addressing reading growth, specifically fluency and comprehension, is necessary. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

By June 2019, teachers will engage in two inquiry studies designed to increase teacher content knowledge and improve 
pedagogy in the teaching of reading (specifically comprehension and fluency) as evidenced on Advance evaluations, 
resulting in a 5% increase of our target group in Grades 3, 4 and 5, meeting or exceeding standards on the State ELA 
Test.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

The direct instruction supplemental program at P.S. 130 will be an after school program to be 
held on Thursday afternoons, from 2:40 pm to 3:40 pm, with 22 sessions, which will address the 
English language learning needs of 71 kindergarten through grade five mandated English 
Language Learners (ELL's) through a partnership with Magic Box Productions, a Media Arts 
Residency.  Instruction will be delivered in English.  The program will begin in October and end 
in June. Students will be grouped by grade.  The fourth and fifth grade cycle will begin on 
Thursday, October 4, 2018  and end on Thursday, November 8, 2018..  The third grade cycle will 
begin on Thursday, November 29, 2018 and end on Thursday, January 3, 2019.  The second 
grade will be broken into two cycles.  The first cycle will begin on Thursday, January 10, 2019 
and end on Thursday, January 31, 2019.  The second cycle will begin on Thursday, February 7, 
2019 and end on March 7, 2019.  The first grade cycle will begin on Thursday, March 14, 2019 
and end on Thursday, March 29, 2019.  The kindergarten cycle will begin on Thursday, April 4, 
2019 and end on Thursday, April 18, 2019.   The ENL teacher will be at all of the 
sessions.  Students With Disabilities will be included in the first, second,  third, fourth and fifth 
grade groups. Newcomers are in the kindergarten group.  Parents will be notified of the program 
in letter format at least two weeks prior to the start of each cycle.  A notification in English and 
in either Chinese, Korean or Spanish (the three main native languages in the school) will be sent 
home.  Copies of these letters will be kept in the Title III file in the ENL classroom.  Student 
attendance will be taken at each session and kept in the Title III file in the ENL classroom.     
(This will be updated in September 2018)  After analyzing the 2017  NYSESLAT data it was 
determined that overall, the ELL's scored the lowest on the Writing Modality.  4.3% of the 13 
current first grade students scored in the bottom third on writing.  3.1% of the 19 current second 
grade students scored in the bottom third on writing.  2.6% of the current third grade students 
scored in the bottom third on writing.  This program will include opportunities for writing such 
as:  writing about student created digital images and animation and writing as part of student 
created storyboards.  Tier II and III vocabulary words will be front loaded as well as pointed out 
and defined with the use of pictures throughout lessons.  Scaffolds to be used are:  oral rehearsal 
before writing and sentence starters and sentence frames. 
Through team teaching, the certified English as a New Language (ENL) teacher and one 
Teaching Artist from Magic Box Productions will guide third, fourth and fifth grade students 
through the mastery of video, photography and digital techniques to explore and document their 
world, and to deepen and demonstrate understanding of academic subjects such as language arts, 
social studies and science.  This program will strengthen ELL's language skills in listening, 
speaking and writing through hands-on project-based learning as they are introduced to the basic 
concepts and terminologies of photography and stop-motion animation through a curriculum 
designed to build vocabulary, creativity and observational and critical thinking skills.  The 
overall theme will be "Our Community".  Third, fourth and fifth grade ELL's will participate in 
Stop Motion Animation. This curriculum teaches the building blocks of sequential art and how to 
turn those pieces into an animated sequence.  The residency encourages student reflection 
through comparisons, defending choices, presenting evidence and persuasion. Skills include 
storyboarding, taking digital images, image manipulation and adding speech to the animation.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Students will work collaboratively to create a series of short, stop-motion animations inspired by 
important places and faces in the local community.  The Teaching Artist will focus her teaching 
on the technological aspects of the project such as how to use the digital camera, image 
manipulation and adding speech to the animation.  The ENL teacher will focus her teaching on 
language acquisition, vocabulary development, storyboarding and promoting conversation.   
Kindergarten, first and second grade ELL's will participate in ten sessions of Digital 
Photography. Students will work in teams to learn vocabulary, techniques and language of digital 
photography, and use these tools to document the faces and places of their school and 
community.  Their photos will be used as a basis for reflection - first in oral rehearsal and next in 
writing.  Through team teaching, the certified ENL teacher, the Common Branch (CB) teacher 
and the Teaching Artist will  instruct and coach students with the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) goal to foster language acquisition and expand vocabulary.  The Teaching 
Artist will focus her teaching on the use of the digital camera and the ENL teacher and CB 
teacher, via the co-teaching model, will focus their teaching on vocabulary development and 
promoting conversations and writing  around the photographs with the use of the scaffolded 
support of using sentence starters and oral rehearsal  before writing. 
Students will be given the opportunity to read native language story books at the beginning of 
each session as well as take them home to read with family members.  Story books are available 
in Chinese, Korean and Spanish, the three main native languages.

Research shows the positive impact of arts experiences for early childhood students, specifically 
with expressive and receptive language.  This medium fosters language acquisition for ELL's of 
all levels from Entering through Commanding.  The Magic Box Productions Residency Program 
provides weekly Professional Development for the ENL teacher working in the Title III After 
School Program. The Teaching Artist will model strategies for integrating digital media to build 
vocabulary, creativity, observational and critical thinking skills. The format for this 
professional learning will include one hour before and after each unit to total 5 hours as 
evidenced by agendas, attendance sheets, meeting minutes and lesson/unit plans.  Topics to be 
covered include: the role of oral rehearsal in writing, building academic vocabulary and the 
importance of explicit and implicit instruction of Tier I, II and III vocabulary.  The ENL 
teacher will share new learnings with classroom teachers during Horizontal and Vertical team 
sessions on Mondays.   
The five Professional Development sessions with the Teaching Artist and the ENL teacher will 
take place on Thursday, October 4, 2018, Thursday, November 29, 2018, Thursday, January 10, 
2019, Thursday, March 14, 2019 and Thursday, April 4, 2019.   Each session will last one 
hour.  There will be a total of 5 sessions.

District 25's vision includes strengthening parent engagement in all school, with all parents. 
Noting the Chancellor's vision for improving quality instruction for ELL's, it is imperative to 
include parents, a key constituent, in the learning process.  Throughout the residency, parents of 
participating students, 71 parents, will be invited to join their children for special events 
facilitated by the certified ENL teacher and Magic Box Productions Teaching Artist.  Events will 
include an International Food Festival, as well as a Film Festival of Animation Videos for second 
and third grade ELL's, and a Photography Exhibition for Kindergarten and first grade 
ELL's.  During these  events, students will share their work as well as the process.  The ENL 
teacher will distribute a letter in English, along with Chinese, Korean and Spanish translations 
(the three main second languages in the school,) inviting parents to these events and the 
information will be posted on the school website.  If needed, parent volunteers will serve as 
translators during the events. 
In addition, The ENL Team, led by the certified ENL teacher, will present to families of ELL's 
on ways that they can support learning at home.  The workshop series will consist of five 40-
minute sessions held in September, October, November, January and March.  Dates will be 
determined in September after parents are surveyed as to the schedule that works best for 
them.  The Parent Coordinator, a member of the ENL Team, will provide outreach to encourage 
parents to take an active role in their child's development of language acquisition. and attend the 
workshops.  
Records will be maintained in the ENL office files.  Evidence and artifacts will include agendas, 
attendance sheets, and parent feedback statements.  The ENL Sub-group Team will present to 
families of ELL's on ways that they can support learning at home.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The Teachers College Comprehensive Literacy Assessment Toolbox assesses independent reading levels, high frequency words, 
letter/sound recognition and concepts of print of all students including ELLs at P.S. 130.  The results of these assessments allow 
us to monitor student progress in literacy across the school year.  In addition, we administer the STAR Reading Assessment.  In 
order to address individual student needs and customize learning, this data allows for strategic small grouping during shared 
reading, guided reading and strategy lessons.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

Across the school year, as assessments are updated, the classroom teachers, ENL teachers and RTI teachers meet to analyze 
the results of the assessments  Data is used to form small groups during the Integrated ENL sessions.  These sessions take 
place 2-3 times per week dependent upon mandated service. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ELL Periodic Assessment is  administered to third,fourth and fifth grade students in the fall and again in the spring.  The 
data allows for differentiated small group instruction based on language proficiency level scores.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teacher, RTI teacher and classroom teachers analyze the ELL Periodic Assessment data during the ENL Team meetings 
on Professional Learning Mondays.  This data informs interventions and serves as a baseline for the June ELL Periodic 
Assessment data. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Classroom teachers and the RTI teacher administer the STARS assessment, a screening tool in reading, in order to establish a 
baseline.  This assessment tests reading comprehension and phonics.  After it is administered in the fall, interventions are 
provided for students who score below benchmark level.  In the spring, the assessment is administered to assess progress.   
After careful analysis of data, students who are not meeting grade-level benchmarks are targeted for Tier 1 interventions 
when teachers implement strategies in the classroom during core instruction.  They monitor and document progress in order 
to determine the effectiveness of the Tier 1 Interventions.  After a cycle of 8 weeks of  the RTI Team, along with the classroom 
teachers, analyze the running record data, conducting a miscue analysis and reviewing both literal and inferential 
comprehension data to determine if Tier 2 interventions are necessary. At this point, the data serves as a guide to determine 
which Tier 2 interventions will be beneficial to meet the specific needs of each student. Progress monitoring data is gathered 
during Tier 2 interventions and analyzed to determine student progress.  Students who demonstrate little to no growth, as 
evidenced on the assessment aligned with the intervention, are provided with Tier 3 interventions. Data drives instruction and 
informs the RTI Team of next steps.  It is a continuous, fluid cycle.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  The NYSESLAT, as well as the State ELA and Math Tests are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During ENL Team meetings, which take place on PL Mondays, the ENL teacher shares the EDAT with the classroom teachers 
and the RTI teacher.  This data allows for instructional planning for ELLs based on the language proficiency needs of the 
students.  The EDAT shows the language modalities where students are at the greatest risk.  Based on professional 
conversations, appropriate differentiated instruction in each modality is planned to support ELL success across the school year. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

Integrated ENL is delivered by the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher using a push-in model.  Students are 
grouped by mixed proficiency levels within each classroom. Standalone ENL is delivered using a pull-out model taught 
by the ENL teacher.  Instruction is provided to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core 
content areas.  Students are grouped by proficiency level across each grade.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Language acquisition strategies are used while supporting the students during Reading and Writing Workshop. Explicit ENL 
instruction, using ENL strategies to build academic vocabulary, sentence structure and sentence variety is aligned  to the 
standards.  Teachers utilize Smart Board technology as a tool for access to content.  In order to plan for alignment of lessons, 
articulation between the classroom teachers and the ENL teacher takes place during common preps and during the Monday 
Professional Development Block.   
Entering students receive 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA.  Emerging students receive 
90 minutes of Stand Alone ENL and 180 minutes of ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or Integrated 
ENL/Content Area.  Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL and 90 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or 
Integrated ENL/Content Area.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other Content 
Area.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in ELA or Content Area or other approved services.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In order to meet the demands of the NYS Learning Standards, content area subjects are delivered via the workshop model 
approach.  This enables teachers to differentiate instruction and work with small groups in order to provide multiple entry 
points to concepts that are sometimes difficult due to their strong language base.  Tier 3 academic vocabulary is introduced 
and discussed and visuals are provided in order to prepare the student for content area understanding.  Students create 
personal word banks as they encounter unknown words and strategies such as using context clues are utilized.  Strategies to 
"read" pictures from complex texts are taught and videos are shown on smart boards. Students engage in discussion circles in 
order to provide opportunities to construct meaning with and from peers. Hands-on activities and experiments motivate and 
allow the ELL student to manipulate "information" in order to construct meaning and draw conclusions.  Clear expectations via 
goals and essential questions at the beginning of the lesson enable the learner to understand what is expected of them and 
prepares them for the thinking that needs to take place while engaging in activities.  Shared reading and Close Reading of 
complex text allow the teacher to ensure understanding through questioning and discussion.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Not Applicable    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We currently do not have any students who are considered SIFE. 
Newcomer and Developing ELLs receive explicit vocabulary instruction of Tier 1 and 2 words, story elements and reading 
comprehension skills.  We differentiate by minutes of instruction depending on student performance level, teacher/student 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

ratio and application of multiple entry points for every lesson.  In addition. differentiation includes increased implementation 
of shared reading, modified guided reading, oral rehearsal/storytelling to support writing, repeated exposure to nursery 
rhythms, chants and songs and use of the language experience approach. 
Former ELLs receive 90 minutes per week of ENL services which include Writing about Reading instruction. 
Test accommodations include:  Prior to assessments,  teachers read directions aloud and unpack question by question.  ELLs 
receive separate location for state assessments. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Additional ELA instruction is given to students who are both SWD and ELL, with a focus on instructional strategies which 
include Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI), Fundations and Great Leaps to support the curriculum as do big books, Ipads and 
native language storybooks.  LLi supports our K-4 students, Fundations offers targeted supported for our Kindergarten and first 
grade students and Great Leaps offers fluency support for all students.  Strategies include Total Physical Response (TPR), oral 
rehearsal, story telling, thinking maps, guided reading, access to checklists, anchor charts and rubric tools, small group 
instruction of shared reading and shared writing, and strategic partnerships for peer to peer conversations.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Flexible scheduling as part of the IEP process is utilized for students with both an SWD and ELL designation in order to provide 
access to more ELA instructional time for these students.  SETSS schedules are coordinated with ICT teachers and ENL teachers 
in order to maximize the instructional time for SWD and ELL students.  P.S. 130 maintains its promise to offer the Least 
Restrictive Environment for all SWD and ELL students.  All ELLs in P.S. 130 are in either in an ICT classroom, 12-1-1 classroom or 
a general education setting and participate fully in all general education classes.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for  ELLs in ELA include:  the ENL, classroom and RTI teachers collaborate to plan targeted 
instruction based on individual identified needs after analysis of assessments.  Interventions and programs include mini-
inquiries to address fluency, literal and inferential comprehension, vocabulary, writing and phonemic awareness.  Programs 
such as Great Leaps and Fundations are used strategically to support students, as needed, in specific cycles for our newcomers. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in Mathematics include:  instruction based on students' individual needs identified by 
assessments and teacher observation.     
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in other content areas include: Cluster teachers collaborate with the ENL and 
classroom teachers to provide additional support and address learning styles through different instructional modalities.  All 
programs are offered in English.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our data show us that our ENL students' area of growth is vocabulary developement.  The ENL teacher will continue to provide 
direct, explicit and rigorous instruction to the ELLs including higher order questioning, academic vocabulary and Close Reading 
of complex texts in the content areas.  Our curriculum and instruction focus is Academic Vocabulary, and the student 
utilization of Tier 1, 2 and 3 words, based on the work of Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore and  Maryann Cucchiara, specifically Shades of 
Meaning and Juicy Sentence Deconstruction and Reconstruction.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students are heterogeneously grouped in classes.  If an ELL student is struggling academically, they will receive Tier I 
services by the classroom teacher.  After progress monitoring, if there is little or no improvement in academics, ELL students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

are recommended for RTI services and are given TIER II interventions outside the classroom.  All grade 3 students are invited to 
be part of the school's test prep program for ELA and Math. 
ELLs have equal access to all school programs such as technology, movement education, music, science and enrichment clubs 
during the school day.   All ELLs are invited to be part of the Title III after school program, which is structured around literacy, 
speaking and listening skills.  Other after school programs include Spanish Immersion, Girl Scouts, Studio in a School and 
Mighty Milers.  Invitation letters are backpacked to parents in English and the parent's preferred language. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We support ELLs through the use of technology.  Our full-time technology teacher delivers instruction in our computer lab 
equpped with 30 desktop computers and a SmartBoard.  Each classroom, equipped with a SMART Board, desktop computers, 
laptops, document cameras and iPads, where ELL's have access to software programs such as Kidspiration, Microsoft Word, 
and Appleworks to create documents, reports, graphic organizers and slide shows based on internet research and classroom 
curriculum.  Furthermore, ELL students access websites for instructional support such as Starfall and Scholastic e-
books.  Native language story books are available as well as translation apps on Ipads such as i-translate.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in the ENL program by providing students with a library of books in their native 
language.  This includes Chinese, Korean and Spanish books on tape, bilingual dictionaries, multilingual songs on CD's.  School 
staff and parent volunteers are available to translate to students and families when needed.  Required service support and 
resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The administration, classroom teachers, ENL teacher, SETSS teacher, RTI teacher, Speech teacher and therapists collaborate 
and review student records  to ensure all services correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.      
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
ELL students who will be newly enrolled in September, and their parents, participate in an annual Orientation in June before 
they start at P.S. 130.   This Orientation is hosted by the administrators, parent coordinator and classroom teachers.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All personnel at the school who work with ELLs, which includes classroom and special education teachers, RTI teacher, SETSS 
teacher, cluster teachers, paraprofessionals, the speech therapist, the guidance counselor, and the parent coordinator, receive 
intensive professional development throughout the school year in order to adapt the Balanced Literacy curriculum with ENL 
strategies.  Classroom and special education teachers with a large ELL population, and the ENL teacher, work together with a 
staff developer from Teacher's College to plan units of study that incorporate both content and language objectives for 
ELLs.  Teachers College Confernce Days, specific to pedagogical approaches for ELL's and Common Core aligned instruction, are 
attended by the ENL teacher as well as classroom teachers.  The ENL teacher and the RTI teacher attend Professional 
Development Workshops at Fordham University sponsored by NYS/NYC RBERN (Regional Bilingual Education Resource 
Network).  Topics include Content Literacy Instruction and Going Deeper With Academic Discourse.  For the past two years, an 
ENL Vertical Team meets to study the work of Maryann Cucchiara involving the teaching of Academic Vocabulary specifically 
Shades of Meaning and Juicy Sentence Deconstruction and Reconstruction.  The ENL teacher and RTI teacher attended a 
Showcase at P.S. 24 to view this work and the entire team visited P.S. 120, a school implementing these strategies to 
observe two lessons and engage in professional discourse with the teachers and principal.  The teachers on the team 
experimented with this work using a complex text recommended to us at the Showcase.  Next year, the team will reconvene 
during Monday Professional Learning to plan and implement lessons around this work. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
During weekly professional learning sessions, Chancellor's Professional Development Days, and after school team meetings, 
teachers receive ELL-specific professional development.  Records such as agendas, attendance sheets, minutes and teacher-
created handouts are maintained. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs will be held during the Parent Engagement Block which is held every 
Tuesday afternoon from 2:40-3:20 p.m.  Individual appointments will be scheduled throughout the course of the school 
year.  As needed, translation services will be provided in the language of preference.   For in person meetings, attendance 
sheets will record attendance and notes from meetings.  These documents will be kept in a file entitled, Annual Individual 
Meetings with Parents in the ENL Classroom.  The ENL teacher will retain notes taken from phone conferences as well.  Copies 
of letters sent home to parents will be filed.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At P.S. 130, all parents, including ELL parents, are invited to be active participants during school activities including Family 
Reading Buddies, PTA meetings, NYSESLAT informational meetings in the spring, and other parent workshops across the school 
year such as Reading and Writing Strategies To Use At Home and Websites For ENL Students.  The ENL teacher works together 
with the Parent Coordinator to ensure that parents of ELLs are are informed about meetings and workshops by distributing 
translated letters, as well as placing a translation stamp on all letters and forms that are backpacked to parents.  P.S. 130 has 
been able to provide interpreters ,in Korean, Chinese and Spanish, who are available when needed at our Open House, the 
Orientation for newly-enrolled students, Parent Teacher Conferences, the ENL Parent Orientation, the annual individual

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michelle Contratti, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
