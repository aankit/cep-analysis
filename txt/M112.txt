Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement at PS 112  

The staff and administrators of our school believe ... 

That each student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her ability to learn. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

That education is fostered through collaboration between the teacher, the student, the parents and the community. 

To this endeavor, we commit ourselves to educational excellence, and provide our students with the best 
opportunities to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially in order to become productive members of 
an ever-changing society.. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As our mission statement states, we believe all children have the ability to learn. PS 112 has a fully inclusive model 
that brings together students of different backgrounds, and abilities. High standards are set in every classroom. We 
customize instruction to better meet the needs of our diverse early childhood population.  

This in tangent with our unique characteristics / features listed below: 

We are a highly recognized early childhood school known for our Autism Spectrum Disorder Nest Program (ASD Nest), 
both Monolingual and Dual Language Program, and our Response to Intervention (RTI) Program. We are a model 
school for Teachers College Reading Writing Project. We have been recognized for our Inner Resilience Model based 
on Linda Lantieri's work on mindfulness social emotional learning. We received the NYCDOE Respect For All Award in 
2017. We were the host school for Learning Partners Programs from 2014-2017, and were responsible for supporting 
the work around oral language development through collaborative conversations. We work closely with Digital Age 
Learning in providing customized supports for teacher learning to support the intentional planning for technology as a 
vehicle to promote student’s engagement and access to the curriculum. As of 2017-2018, more than 50 percent of our 
staff has integrated various forms of technology tools in their core instruction.  

In 2018-2019 we will be working with Yale on social emotional learning through the RULER Program to continue to 
support social emotional learning throughout the school.  

In 2018-2019, PS112 will establish an Equity and Access Committee to address disproportionality, expectations , 
misconceptions and cultural dissonance.  

An initiative we have continued to work on for the last four years:  

Research shows that children's vocabulary is correlated with reading comprehension in upper elementary school. 
(Tabors, 2001) and that vocabulary size is an effective predictor of reading comprehension in middle elementary 
years. Therefore, we are currently and will continue to foster rigorous and targeted instruction in oral language 
development and academic literacy through the development of teacher content knowledge and expertise via 
teacher collaboration (through Professional Learning Communities, (PLC) within our school, along with literacy and 
language experts in the field (such as Stanford University and Nonie Lesaux), to provide our staff and at risk students 
and families with the best current research based practices necessary for the development of academic language and 
literacy skills for all students inclusive of English Language Learners.  

Through our collaborative teams, which are comprised of classroom teachers, (inclusive of model teachers, and 
instructional leads), English as a new language teacher, reading teachers, specialists, and administrators, students 
engaged in collaborative conversations where they generate ideas and build upon each other’s ideas, throughout the 
various disciplines. The collaborative teams engaged in a study of student led collaborative conversations, where the 
team members build their content knowledge and expertise in the planning for and implementing of lessons which 
develop academic content knowledge and discourse. In this process teams engaged in:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  Analysis of student conversations using the Conversation Analysis Tool (CAT), the Common Core Learning 

Standards (CCLS) listening and speaking standards, New York State English as Second Language Assessment 
Test (NYSESLAT speaking rubrics, and Universal Rubrics.  
Lesson planning for academic and language objectives, as well as conversational skills; 

Studying best current research based practices; 

 
  Assessing student work using the Universal Language Rubric  
 
  Applying current instructional practices that support targeted areas;  
  Differentiating based on student needs (ELLs and students with language processing delays)  
  Evaluating student achievement and impact of professional practice. 
 

Inter-visitations  

As a result, our data (CAT Tool) indicated that all students made gains with Dimension 0 and 1 (sustaining a 
conversation about the academic content through mutual exchanges and building upon each other’s ideas). In 
addition, our English language learners demonstrated significant gains in expressing understanding of concepts taught 
in the discipline areas using appropriate academic language (vocabulary and sentence complexity and variation), as 
measured by the CAT Tool, formative assessments (using Universal Language Rubric as a measure), and teacher 
anecdotes. Therefore, this past year, we were successful in the collaborative teacher framework as our collaborative 
teacher / pedagogues supported rigorous instruction that was customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the 
NYS Standards.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Out of our 340 students, approximately 41% have Individualized Educational Plans (IEP), 21% are classified as English 
Language Learners (ELLs), and over 97% are below the poverty level. Over a third of our students have language 
developmental delays, and or language processing delays. 10% of our student population have high functioning 
Autism. In addition, we have a culturally diverse population comprised of various ethnic groups, with an exponential 
increase in immigrant groups from various countries such as Yemen, Russia, China, Central America, Dominican 
Republic, and Mexico.  

Our students and their families demonstrate multiple needs in the areas of oral language and literacy development. 
Many students do not enter our school with the extensive vocabulary and academic language needed to become 
successful readers and writers. Some students have difficulty with pragmatic language. Many families do not have 
access to the resources and an understanding of how to support their child’s learning at home to develop oral 
language and early literacy skills.  

As research has correlated a strong relationship between oral language and reading comprehension, we must 
intentionally plan for all the components of oral language (phonological skills, syntax, morphological skills, pragmatics, 
and vocabulary/ semantics) to ensure our students development and ultimate success in reading. By doing so, we 
must also provide extensive opportunities for student application throughout the day, and throughout multiple 
disciplines, providing appropriate scaffolds to ensure their success.  

Providing rigorous yet differentiated instruction using CCLS NYSELA standards (being mindful of the big ideas for the 
implementation of the NYS New Generations Standards for following school year) aligned curriculum that promote 
academic literacy, along with special attention paid to oral language development, will allow for our students needs 
to be met, and ensure all of our students achieve at high levels in all academic areas as well as for some, in a second 
language.

In 2018-2019 we will continue to develop academic literacy through the intentional planning of collaborative 
conversations and constructed writing responses, using the collaborative team model as well as the effective school 
leadership framework.  

These past few years, we worked closely at developing our model teachers content knowledge and expertise as well 
as their facilitation skills. As administrators worked closely and collaboratively with various teacher teams (as 
instructional leaders and thinkers), model teachers developed their facilitation skills and led professional learning 
communities’ inquiry that led to improved student achievement in listening, speaking, reading, mathematics, and 
science. Having model teachers support their colleagues through inter-visitations, collaborative lesson design, and 
implementation of researched based practices as they are being supported by their administrators/ instructional 
leaders (through weekly planning sessions), and outside collaborations such as consultants, teachers from other 
schools, and conferences, allowed for the learning to deepen. During inter-visitations, teacher teams and 
administrators provided constructive feedback using a school-wide protocol (school created). During the final teacher 
reflection conferences, most teachers reflected that this was a very useful tool that supported their professional 
growth.  

This was pivotal in the school-wide implementation of this instructional focus as these teacher teams led the work. 
We saw the school-wide growth of student collaborative conversations and use of academic language in these “talks”. 
More than 80% of our students achieved Domain 0 using the CAT Tool and 75% of teachers were rated effective on 
DF3b and 25% were High Effective (HE), thus we met our 2017-18 CEP goal. 80 percent of our model teachers were 
HE. Therefore, we have been able to sustain the work albeit with new teachers, through our school-wide initiative.  

In DF3c, we have 69% of our staff rated effective, and 31% as highly effective. We will continue our work with 
differentiated student instruction, as this has been an area of instruction for our teacher teams (in literacy and math).  

We will also continue to strengthen rigorous instruction through the collaborative teams comprised of classroom 
teachers and the math coach, as this past year we continued to see gains in student achievement in mathematics as 
evidenced by our end of year Measurement of Student Learning (MOSL) Performance Task and the Metamorphosis 
Assessment Tool. As teachers analyzed the math data, specific skills were targeted across the grade, and were 
strategically planned for, implemented, and measured, as part of the daily instruction within the mathematical 
routines part of the day. Mathematical Reasoning was also planned for in grade teams. Math Instructional Leads 
supported the development of math lessons that impacted: students number sense with automaticity and problem 
solving. In addition, the math coach and the consultant from Metamorphosis collaborated with teachers in the 
analysis of data and the targeting of skills that support student growth.  

In conclusion, rigorous instruction as well as collaborative teacher teams will continue to be areas of focus for our 
school which will help meet the needs of our highly diverse population.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
As part of our CEP Goal 1 (2017-2018) teacher teams (comprised of reading specialists, literacy leads and classroom 
teachers) collaborated on the administration and analysis of various reading assessments Dynamic Indicators of Basic 
Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) and Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment (F&P) to: 

  Track student progress across grades 
  To make instructional decisions for subgroups and individual students 
  And to make adjustments to the curriculum and instruction 

This past school year, as per the recommendations of the frameworks for early literacy, we focused on the 
“integration of a variety of developmentally appropriate practices and evidence-based instructional approaches” via:  

 
 

 

Systematic implementation of phonics program with fidelity and frequency. 
Intentional planning and implementation of shared reading lessons of grade level texts with appropriate 
scaffolds to develop fluency and comprehension. 
Intentional planning and implementation of interactive writing and shared writing of constructed responses 
lessons to support the transference of decoding and encoding skills.  

By the end of the year, all students were immersed in the reading of texts of varying complexities: grade level texts 
with teacher and peer support; independent texts; and guided reading texts with teacher supports. They engaged in 
collaborative conversations about the reading as well as constructed responses to demonstrate their comprehension. 
We observed many more students taking intellectual risks and engaging in discourse about the texts.  

According to our formative data, our second grade met the 20% growth goal (benchmark). First and kindergarten data 
was below the expected 20% goal.  

Below is our analysis of formative assessment. 

Reading  

In reading, we use Fountas and Pinnell Assessments (F&P) (as both formative and summative end of year) to 
determine student's reading progress; implications for whole group instruction; small group instruction; and 
intervention. We also use the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) Assessment to gather 
additional information about code-based skills, as many of our students need support with decoding, and word 
automaticity.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

Teacher teams disaggregated the data of the different sub groups to determine student progress and achievement. 
Teachers compared baseline data to the summative data and documented growth for all sub-groups: Students with 
disabilities and English Language learners (ELLs), Hispanic and black, boys, girls. Teacher teams compared students 
who were performing at various levels, such students who were near, at or above grade level as well as those 
students who were below grade level and “at risk.” 

Our analysis yielded of the 2017-2018 F&P data yielded the following: 

In grade 2 F&P:  

  63% of our student are at and above grade level (L/M/ N and above) and 16% approaching (Level K). 22% 

were below grade level (J and below) with 55% of those students scoring within the I and J levels. 

  Of the lowest quartile, (20 students): 10 students (or 50% have IEPs) and 4 of these 10 students are also 

ELLs with IEPs with speech and language processing delays; and 10 students who have no IEPs, 3 are ELLs. Of 
the 7 who are not ELLs and do not have IEPs, they made an average of three reading levels. 

  43% of our ELLs are at and above end of year benchmark. 24% are approaching and 33% are below end of 

year benchmark. 

  54% of students with IEPs are at and above end of year benchmark, 17% are approaching and 29% are 

below end of year benchmark. 

In grade 2 DIBELS:  

  Oral reading accuracy 62% at or above; 17% approaching; and 21% far below grade level.  
  Oral reading fluency 41% at or above; 27% approaching; and 32% far below grade level.  

Both assessments yielded similar results for oral reading.  

In grade 1 F&P:  

  36% of our student at and above grade level (Grade 1 benchmark is Level I/J independent). 17% of our 

students were approaching benchmark (Level G/H), and 41% were below benchmark (A-F levels). 

  Of the lowest quartile, (41 students): 13 students (or 32% have IEPs) and 5 of these 11 students are also 

ELLs with IEPs with speech and language processing delays (three are emergent ELLs, and one in an entering 
ELLs); and 28 students who have no IEPs, 3 are ELLs. Of the 7 who are not ELLs and do not have IEPs, they 
made an average of three reading levels. 

  19% of our ELLs are at and above end of year benchmark. 24% are approaching and 33% are below end of 

year benchmark. In Spanish, the results demonstrate progress of over a year’s worth but it is till below 
grade level. 

  35% of students with IEPs are at and above end of year benchmark, 19% are approaching and 75% are 

below end of year benchmark.  

In grade 1 DIBELS:  

  Oral reading accuracy 39% at or above; 20% approaching; and 41% far below grade level.  
  Oral reading fluency 38% at or above; 15% approaching; and 47% far below grade level.  
  Nonsense word fluency (CLS) 28% at or above; 10% approaching; and 72% far below grade level. 
  Nonsense word fluency whole word reading 23% at or above; 30% approaching; and 47% far below grade 

level. 

Both assessments yielded similar results for oral reading. It is evident that the word attack skills or the phonics is a 
point of concern. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

In grade K F&P:  

  39% of our student are at and above grade level (Grade k benchmark is Level C/ D independent), 23% are 

approaching and 40% are below the end of year benchmark. Of the lowest quartile, (37 students): 14 students 
have IEPs (38%) and 5 of these 14 students are also ELLs with IEPs; and 8 students are ELLs who have no IEPs.  

  14% of our ELLs are at are benchmarking the end of year benchmark and 28% approaching, and 59% are 

below the end of year benchmark. This is for English only and doesn't include the Spanish data for our ELLs 
learning in two languages. 

  38% of students with IEPs benchmarking the end of year benchmark, 28% are approaching, and 36% are 

below the end of year benchmark. 

In grade K DIBELS 

  Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF) 38% at or above; 35% approaching; and 24% far below grade level. 
  Phoneme Segmentation Fluency 14% at or above; 34% approaching; and 48% far below grade level. 

Both assessments identified similar number of students at grade level. It is evident that the word attack skills or the 
phonics is a point of concern. Segmenting individual sounds is a skill for improvement.  

OVERALL Areas of strength  

 

Second grade made progress throughout the school year. They began with 45% at or above grade level and 
they ended with 63% at or above grade level, with an increase of 18%. Students with IEPS and ELLs made a 
20% increase. This date correlates with DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency (ORF). 

Areas of concern 

  Grade k and 1 were approximately 40% at or above grade level which is well below the 60% benchmark 

expected.  

  According to DIBELs data, decoding skills are well below grade level, therefore phonics may be a factor for 
the low number of students meeting the benchmark in the F&P assessment (the average level being bench 
marked in grade k is B (2.91) and in 1st is F (6.58).) 

  ELLs in grades k and 1st have shown a decrease at or above end of year benchmark. However, our ELLs data 

is English only, which is a change from previous years as we are expecting progress in both languages. 

As a result, areas of priority for our school are  

 

 

Strengthen students decoding skills- high frequency words, phonogram patterns, and words with complex 
spelling patterns -through the explicit teaching of decoding and encoding skills through the implementation of 
word study programs with fidelity, shared reading of complex texts, and interactive writing. Including 
phonemic awareness not just phonics instruction.  
Strengthen teachers understanding of the teaching of word solving actions, having several decoding 
approaches that effectively support all students inclusive of students who are acquiring a second language 
and students who have speech language processing disorders. 

  Continued and ongoing data analysis to support targeted instruction and differentiation, inclusive of progress 

monitoring and adjustment of instruction based on the immediate analysis.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
PS 112 is an Inner Resilience school that not only supports the students' academic growth, but also their social 
emotional development. All of our students are taught strategies to calm their body and quiet the mind. Students are 
taught strategies to self-regulate their behavior and as a result, classrooms are calm. This has had a significant impact 
on the academic success of our students. Children also participate in yoga to help them to focus and be in control of 
their bodies. Students who are identified as "at risk" are provided with support to ensure that the student is able to 
be present to learn.  

 

Our teachers participate in mindfulness practices and the development of their own Social Emotional Learning in 
order to effectively develop these skills in children. In 2018-2019, PS 112 will participate in professional learning with 
a consultant from Yale's RULER Program on social emotional learning. PS 112 will be provided with a RULER 
Coach.Ruler is an evidenced based approach for integrating social and emotional learning into schools, developed at 
the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. "RULER" applies "hard science" to the teaching of what has been 
historically been called "soft Skills." RULER teaches the skills of emotional intelligence-----recognizing, understanding, 
labeling, expressing and regulating emotion. Research shows that these kills are essential to effective teaching and 
learning, sound decision making, mental and physical health and success in school and beyond. 

 

A related benefit is the cultivation of relational trust that is fostered when teachers engage collaboratively supporting 
their Inner Resilience. PS 112 creates a safe space for students to learn and grow. 

 

On the Quality Review, we received a well developed on "How clearly are expectations communicated to students." 
On the 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, 97% responded positively to the questions about Supportive 
Environment. 100% of the teachers say that the students are safe in the hallways, bathrooms, and cafeteria. 96% of 
the teachers say that adults at the school teach students how to advocate for themselves. 97% of the teachers say 
students feel it is important to come to school everyday. On the Learning Environment Survey, 93% of the teachers 
stated that the school works on developing students' social skills. 

 

This past year, we observed a slight rise in the incident of students who needed additional supports in learning how to 
self regulate their behaviors, calm their bodies to engage in intellectually demanding tasks, and to foster collaborative 
relationships with their peers during their coursework. As the demands of the work gets more challenging, we want to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27 

 

ensure our students can focus and be ready to be successful in standards based grade appropriate tasks throughout 
the various content areas.  

 

This past year and this forthcoming year, we will have approximately 15% staff who have less than three years in the 
building and therefore we want to ensure that they are successful in the implementation of strategies that foster the 
mindfulness social emotional learning within their roles. The improvement of school culture is a continuous goal for 
the success of our school community inclusive of all staff and parents.  

 

PS 112 will have a Social Emotional Learning Team consisting of a social worker, principal; assistant principal; ASD 
Coach; the school psychologist and one teacher from every grade to support the work of mindfulness social 
emotional learning in the school.   

PS 112 will establish a functioning Equity and Access Committee to address disproportionality , expectations, 
misconceptions and cultural dissonance which will address this goal. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 90% of our students will demonstrate the ability to self regulate their behavior so as to actively 
participate and engage in their own learning with the support of teachers and all staff as measured by school wide 
assessments and by the reduction of incidents in OORS.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Mindfulness SEL Professional Learning Community will be 
formed and will meet regularly throughout the year to support 
teachers in implementing mindfulness SEL strategies and provide 
professional development on mindfulness SEL strategies. This 
group will study current best practice to support students to self 
regulate their behaviors within the classroom setting 
(challenging demanding tasks) and outside of their classroom 
setting in public shared places such as the library and cafeteria. 

 

The PLC will create 4 vertical labsites representative of grades 
Pre-k -2 .

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Providing early and targeted Intervention instruction for our lowest performing students is key to ensuring that all 
students achieve at high levels in math and make progress. As per the Response to Intervention Model, we will aim 
for 80% of our students to demonstrate mastery of Tier 1 Math curriculum that is aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards,despite the fact that we have 40% students with disabilities and 21% of English language 
learners. We will also begin to address the big ideas from the New Generations Standards for Mathematics (in 
preparation for the 2018-2019 implementation) so as to continue to maintain the rigor through building student’s 
conceptual understanding, procedure skills and applications.  

As a result of implementing Data Driven Instruction, our students made gains across each grade level in operations 
and algebraic thinking (which was our focus). Analyzing data collaboratively and systematically, allowed grade level 
teams to make adjustments to the curricula. Teacher teams, alongside the math coach and math consultant, 
designed, implemented routines and tasks that supported targeted skills needed to improve student outcomes in 
operations and algebraic thinking, and that promoted problem solving skills and mathematical reasoning. Action 
plans for the grade were created and the math consultant supported building teachers content knowledge and 
expertise to create coherent instruction that addressed the needs for the grade. These grade wide action plans 
(three) created were progress monitored and revised to ensure significant class-wide increases in the targeted 
math skills. In addition, grade wide math leads served as lab-sites for teachers team to visit, share best practices, 
serve as models, and provide constructive feedback, so at to support grade wide coherence in best practices for 
instruction.  

 

2017-2018 MOSL Results: 

Kindergarten  

  Average score for end of year was 59.4% which had an increase of 34.4 % (from the baseline). The average

ones 

o  Count within 1000; skip-count by 5s, 10s, and 100s. 

  Approaching 2.OA.4 69.8% Use addition to find the total number of objects arranged in rectangular arrays 
with up to 5 rows and up to 5 columns; write an equation to express the total as a sum of equal addends. 

Area of concern:  

  2.OA.1 61% - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving 

situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all 
positions 

  2.OA.3 58%- Determine whether a group of objects (up to 20) has an odd or even number of members 

 

Overall Strength for Grades k-2 

  Kindergarten an overall strength is in counting cardinality. Our school-wide implementation of routines 

 

using the bead work has been very successful, therefore we will continue that work.  
First and Second grade demonstrate strengths in number and operations and based 10, specifically counting 
and comparing numbers to 120. Our school-wide implementation of routines using the bead work and othr 
models such as the closed number line and open number line, have been very successful, therefore we will 
continue that work. 

Overall Improvements for Grades K-2:  

 

 

In kindergarten and grade 1 , an area of focus is number and operations and base 10, as related to 
understanding numbers in the pattern system, and early ideas of place value (decomposing and composing 
numbers). 
In second grade, an area of focus in operations and algebraic thinking, specifically in using addition and 
subtraction to solve one and two word problems.  

Area for focus for intervention: Targeting mathematical standards and foundational skills.  

 

School-wide focus on supporting the development of place value through various structures such a TERC 
curriculum, Context for Learning Units, and Teacher created routines.  

  Grade 2: Standard OA.1 Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one and two step word problems 

involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart , and comparing, with 
unknowns in all positions. 

 

As the collaborative vertical math leads teams and the grade level teams were influential in establishing math 
routines that were successful and impacted student achievement, (co-planning, inter-visitations, constructed 
feedback, joint data analysis), then we will use the same structure to support teachers building of content 
knowledge and pedagogical practices to support the development of place value, which is an area of need, as well 
as solving two step word problems.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Mission Statement at PS 112 emphasizes that, “every student will be given the opportunity to maximize his/her 
ability to learn”.., and that we, “commit ourselves to build an educational atmosphere for learning … (so that all 
students) develop physically, intellectually, emotionally and socially.” As an effective leader, the mission created by 
the principal and in collaboration with all staff members, clearly allows for a pathway of excellence for all students 
regardless of their backgrounds and socio-economic status. In fact, on the New York City Survey on Effective 
Leadership: 98% of the teachers stated that the principal communicates a clear vision for this school. 

PS 112 services a very diverse population of early childhood students (40% students with IEPs, which is comprised of 
students with autism, students with language and processing delays, 21% ELLs, (20% of these ELLs have IEPs), 
students who come from first generation immigrants, as well as students who have been born to the US, and over 
95% students who are entitled to free lunch and therefore whose families are living below the poverty level. We 
believe all students are able to learn and should have access to high quality rigorous instruction that prepares them 
for college and career readiness. This being said, we require a highly specialized staff that can support our students 
and address their social-emotional needs, as well as their linguistic and cognitive needs. 

To address the specialization, and to impact student achievement, we believe in building teacher's content knowledge 
and pedagogical practices (Danielson Framework 1A) collaboratively through the active participation in and 
facilitation of professional learning communities (DF4D) with support from school instructional leaders. We have 
therefore placed building teacher content knowledge and expertise and building leadership capacity at the core of our 
teacher professional development opportunities. 

As per the NYCDOE Leadership Competencies, the principal has shown proficiency in the building of strong teams, 
development of leadership capacity among staff, and sharing responsibilities appropriately. By creating instructional 
goals that are based on the school-wide data, and creating teams that support these instructional goals, we have seen 
an impact on student achievement across content areas - oral and literacy development and math concepts 
(conversation analysis tool (CAT), math exemplars, and F&P reading assessments, Estrellita assessment) and teacher 
professional growth (100% of our staff is rated at minimum effective). In addition, on the NYC Environment Survey on 
Effective Leadership: 97% of the teachers stated that the principal makes clear her expectations for meeting 
instructional goals. 

On our 2014-2015 Quality Review PS 112 received a Well Developed. The reviewer wrote, “The vast majority of 
teachers are engaged in inquiry -based, structured professional collaborations which increase teacher capacity and 
the promotion of Common Core Learning Standards. Distributed leadership structures are embedded through 
effective teacher leaders for decision making on teaching and learning. The impact is school-wide coherence and 
teacher leadership decisions increased student achievement for all learners...” 

For the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018, model teachers and instructional leads have been leading 
the work in the professional learning communities and study groups with the support and guidance of school leaders 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

and consultants. In 2017-2018, seven model teachers, and eight instructional leads, were identified to support 
student achievement by planning intentionally for academic language and content throughout the content areas - for 
concept development, language development, and literacy development. The following initiatives were undertaken 
by various leadership teams: students development of content knowledge and academic discourse in math and 
science; students development of fluency and comprehension to support literacy development; student development 
of problem solving skills in mathematics; use of appropriate interventions that support struggling readers, inclusive of 
ELLs through the RTI model; integration of technology to support communication and student accessibility to 
challenging content; 

School-wide structures have been established that promote learning, collaboration, and communication throughout 
the school. The model teachers and instructional leads are provided with an additional prep to assume their 
professional learning and in addition are provided with additional monetary compensation for leading their PLCs 
before and after school. They meet twice a month as a group to discuss their learning as leaders and to plan for 
professional learning opportunities for their specific grade levels. They meet with consultants, math coach, AP, at 
least twice a month to review data, enrich content knowledge, and to identify and practice best research based 
practices. 

The model teachers meet on a weekly basis with the assistant principal, to study their facilitation practices and/ or 
build upon their content knowledge and expertise. In addition, the model teachers and instructional leads meet at 
least 15 times during the year with a consultant to build their specific content knowledge and expertise within their 
classrooms as well as in teams. All model teachers and instructional leads meet with the principal/AP on a monthly 
basis to discuss their progress as well as their student progress. Consultants we work with are from Teacher's College 
Reading and Writing Project, Metamorphosis, Digital Age Learning and Stanford University coursework, and planning 
for academic literacy based on the work from Nonie Lesaux. 

We have provided structures and supports for our model teachers to implement best researched practices by 
identifying and studying the work of specialists in their identified area of need, and having them engage in this area 
first as learners with our administration, coaches, consultants and other peers who share some expertise in this area 
and then as facilitators with their colleagues. To support their participation as learners, they are demonstrating 
leadership by facilitating for their own peers. Our Model teachers have opened up their classrooms to other 
colleagues inside and outside of our school. They have also visited other schools to further develop their own 
learning. 

In the past, we participated in a collaborative process as a lead school with 7 other schools focusing on oral language 
development and academic discourse of our students in English and Spanish, promoting teacher leadership in 
collaborations with the teachers from other dual language schools around a common focus of building capacity in our 
teachers, as well as principals supporting one another. In 2017-2018 we continued to support some of our former 
partner schools through a Learning Partners Continuation Grant. This year, we are forging relationships with some 
NYS schools looking critically at writing with ELLs. 

The professional development team, reading team, math coach, and PLC leaders support in the identification and 
facilitation of workshops, data clinics, and study groups teachers on the Monday professional development sessions. 
Teachers collaborate in grade teams in the area of inquiry : Planning for Academic Literacy; Interactive Writing; 
Shared Reading, Unpacking of Complex Text Study Group; Fluency; Response to Intervention; Estrellita Word Study; 
RTI for Struggling Readers: Planning for Intentional Math Routines that support Problem Solving Study group. 

PS 112 maintains a strong staff/parent collaboration including, but not limited to the School Leadership Team (There 
are six parent members; a strong PTA; a Health and Wellness Committee; Inner resilience workshops that help 
parents learn how to manage stress and take care of themselves. All parents are invited to attend writing 
celebrations, performances and multicultural celebrations throughout the year. We want to use our instructional 
leads to work with groups of parent to develop their ability to lead parent workshops.

Using the NYCDOE Leadership Competencies, the identified goal for effective leadership is: 

  The continuation and expansion of strong teams (PLCs) that impact student achievement through: the 
effective analysis of data; implementation of research based practices; collaboration amongst various 
stakeholders; and promotes positive shifts in teacher practices. 

  The creation of a leadership team that works with the principal and assistant principal so as to appropriately 

and effectively engages multiple voices in decision-making and implementation. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Parents are key partners in their child’s education. Continuing to increase parent involvement is crucial to 
improving student outcomes. While PS 112 has a significant amount of parents that are involved in school 
activities, we continue to strive for greater participation of parents.  

The 2017-2018 New York City School Survey indicated that 97% of the parents were satisfied with the Instructional 
Core, 97% were satisfied with the Systems for Improvement, and 97% were satisfied with the School Culture.  

This 2017-2018 New York City School Survey Survey indicated that 82% of our parents stated that they had been 
asked or had the opportunity to volunteer time to support the school. Also 92% of the parents had stated that they 
had been invited to observe instruction. This year the parent coordinator, PTA president, and a teacher committee 
are looking at ways to improve volunteers participating in varied school functions and events as well as increasing 
the opportunities for parents observation of classroom instruction during the school day.  

PS 112 has a culture of mutual accountability that leads successful family partnerships. The school offers multiple 
family workshops on the standards and ways to support their children at home. Family workshops allow parents 
and students to work together on tasks.” 

For the 2017-2018 school year, we had 98% for parent/teacher conferences in November and in March 98% of the 
parents attend the parent/teacher conferences. In May we had parent /teacher conferences for parents of our “at risk 
“students. 101 parents attended. Throughout the school year we had over 1200 parents attending school events that 
includes curriculum night, workshops, performances, exhibitions, 7 Ramapo training and PTA meetings 

Our teachers indicated in the 2017-2018 Framework for Great School Report/ New York City School Survey that they 
believed 82% parents were involved in the school, which is significantly lower to the teachers’ perception of their 
outreach to parents which was 96%. According to the survey, parent’s teacher trust was rated 97% and parent 
principal trust was 95%. Therefore, we need to capitalize in the mutual trust our school and parents have, and build 
upon the collaboration between all stakeholders so that we are working together as equal partners towards the 
students’ education.  

We want to continue to improve home/school communication and engagement. We want to engage more parents in 
decision making and promote active involvement of parents. We have updated our website to be interactive and to 
provide parents with information about the homework. In 21018-=2019 we plan to provide parents with the content 
knowledge they need to support their child at home. For our Dual Language parents, .we will support them to help 
their child with the parent's non-dominant language. Parents have requested more support with helping their child

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
● We have placed building teacher expertise and leadership at the core of all our teacher professional development 
opportunities. By developing expertise in a discipline, we see an increase in student achievement in all content areas. 
We have strategically and systematically maximized the use of our 5 Model Teachers in a unique and innovative way 
by having them support our school-wide initiatives by specializing in targeted areas of need, provided differentiated 
instruction, and serve as models for their peers.  

● We have empowered teacher teams through the creation of grade level Instructional Leaders that support our 
school wide initiatives, support student achievement in math and literacy, and address the needs of our dual language 
and special needs students. We have created structures for our Instructional Leaders to collaborate vertically, deepen 
their practice of teaching and learning and then facilitate their learning to their grade level colleagues.  

● The school is implementing high quality professional development that is aligned with the New Generation 
Standards in literacy and math. Our professional development is outcome based and directly linked to student 
outcomes through data analysis. We conduct professional learning through a variety of research based strategies 
drawn from the New York City Professional Standards and the National Council of Staff Development. 

● These strategies include job embedded support for demonstration lessons, modeling of research based strategies. 
In addition, teachers conduct action research, participate in study groups based on their identified needs and 
interests and research specific issues or questions that support them in developing best practices. Another research 
based strategy is intra-visitations where teachers are encouraged to visit one another’s classrooms in order for them 
to learn and benefit from one another’s expertise and experiences. Teachers are provided with coaching and 
modeling of lessons by grade level instructional leads, model teachers and the math coach. Teachers meet weekly in 
grade level teams to study student work, analyze data and plan collaboratively. Teachers are provided with the 
opportunity to participate in grade level inquiry teams. PS 112 has vertical teams in math, literacy, bilingual and 
special education. Teachers are provided with the opportunity to attend and present at conferences.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 112 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 112 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Rationale 
Research shows that strong oral language is correlated with strong reading 
comprehension.  Therefore, the Title III Program at PS112 focuses on the development of 
students’ oral language - specifically academic discourse- to support overall reading 
comprehension. Given our very diverse population with various needs, (20% population 
of ELLs and of these 22% approximately  have IEPs, and are being serviced for language and 
processing delays), the focus of the supplemental instruction is to 
build our student's academic literacy through integrated content instruction.  Our data, as well as 
the demands of academic language as per the current NYS Common Core Learning Standards , 
provide a strong rationale for providing supplemental instruction in English oral 
language and literacy development through the intentional planning and implementation of 
academic language and concepts development (working across all language domains as opposed 
to focusing only on one domain). 
Our current data shows the importance shows this: 
According to NYSESLAT June 2018 data,  
· 
Stand Alone ESL&nbsp;. In our Stand Alone ESL, Speaking was an area that showed least 
amount of progress. In both programs writing made very small positive changes, 
suggesting&nbsp;an area of growth.&nbsp; 
· 
decreases, particularly in reading. We saw small yet constant increase in writing. With our 
general ELL population, we saw increases in receptive language and decreases with expressive 
language. Therefore, we need to strengthen the correlation between listening, speaking, reading, 
and writing through connected learning activities, using language models for all students. 
Therefore, the Title III program at PS112 is designed to provide intensive targeted language 
instruction to our English Language Learners, through sequenced, tailored instruction that 
provides students with guided practice, corrective feedback, and multiple media forms to ensure 
student access to the language of the content and multiple opportunities for application 
(receptively and expressively) - all four language domains.  
  
About the Program 
All students will be engaged in a twelve session supplemental science based inter-disciplinary 
unit about Animal Diversity and Animals as Living Organisms as per the NYCDOE Science 
Scope and Sequence . 
The goal of this program is to Increase academic language discourse through an inquiry science 
based learning approach – with a focus on the alignment of content and language objectives that 
support student access of information and application of learning. Planning for language will 
include (but not be limited to): vocabulary, syntax, and semantics. The teachers will provide 
targeted and sequenced language instruction to support the development of:

With support from teachers, students will research an animal that is either a mammal, amphibian, 
or reptile, develop a set of data, and then transform the data into a group presentation using 
technology/ various digital tools. The final presentation will be delivered orally where students 
speaking / presentation of the content will be assessed with Universal English Language 
Learners Development Rubric. The written response will be used as a final assessment. 
The program will be comprised of three project stages, which will address all 
four ENL modalities (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). These stages are:

to gather information; cross check; and synthesize new information learned. Discussing new

· 
research. 
Technology is being used as a vehicle to access complex content, build background knowledge, 
and express information is various ways. As an example, use of videos with focused questions 
support building of background knowledge prior to reading a more complex text about the 
topic. For the informational writing component, students will have access to information on their 
subject through various media; videos, articles, images, etc. and will be able to use what they've 
learned to inform their original writing pieces. In addition, writing tools such a graphic 
organizers are being used to organize their information cohesively. 
All students will listen to podcasts for further information about their topics. This would allow 
them to listen carefully to academic language, paraphrase their learning in their own words using 
the appropriate vocabulary, and write the information in their own words.  
This program will explicitly teach / front load vocabulary and syntax as part as per the science 
unit, for the first fifteen minutes of each session, and be closely monitored throughout the 
sessions. In addition, all students will be engaged in targeted collaborative conversations to 
ensure application of the language being explicitly taught. Teachers will assess and differentiate 
as per the data collected.  
Subgroup and grade levels of students to be served  
This program will be offered to fifty first and second grade ELLs. Using the ELL Data Analysis 
Tool (EDAT) as a guide, as our analysis of the NYSESLAT data from 2017-2018, we will be 
servicing all ELLs in all stages - Entering , Emergent, Transitional, Expanding, and 
Commanding (some in commanding who will benefit from additional support)- as we have 
significant numbers  in each stage as opposed to just in certain stages only,. Therefore, we will 
continue to have our students move proficiency levels as per the NYSELSLAT, while also 
increasing the number of students who reach  proficiency or commanding level in English.   
In addition, we will also provide additional supports (within the program) for our ELLs who are 
at risk of becoming long term ELLs as they have been receiving services for over three years. 
Since we are a k-2 school, these same students are usually hold-overs as well. In addition, as we 
have a significant number of ELLs with IEPs, 20%, we would also be servicing our ELLs with 
disabilities, using both their IEP goals as well as data to make instructional decisions that will 
support their language and literacy development in English.  
Students will be serviced in groups no larger than eight students, for a total of six groups.  First 
and second grade students will be mixed together according to their NYSELSAT scores as well 
as their F&P Reading (English) Assessments  and Writing Data– to provide more targeted 
instruction.  The ENL teacher will team with the teacher working with the at risk students to

ensure that they are provided with additional language support in a smaller group setting (total 2 
out of the 7 groups). A bilingual special education teacher and a bilingual education teacher will 
be assigned to work with students with IEPS that require more targeted instruction. 
 
Schedule and duration 
This is a twelve week after-school program that meets one hour and 30 minutes once a week, 
commencing on December 12th, 2018  and ending March 27th, 2019 on Wednesday's from 2:40 
p.m.-4:10 p.m. 
There will be additional 5 session for teachers only for the purposes for professional 
development which will held beginning the program, December 5th and 6th , 2018 and 
throughout the program  (January 2019 and February 2019) to ensure differentiated instruction is 
occurring for all students based on data analysis. 
 
Language of Instruction  
Instruction for this program will primarily occur in English, with some native language supports 
as needed. As an example, looking at cognates that cross over in English and Spanish will be 
used as a scaffold in understanding the academic language and concepts.  For emergent and 
entering ELLs , concepts will be introduced in native language as necessary to support concept 
development.

Due to the diverse ELL population we service, and the significant amount of students with 
language delays in their own native language,  it is imperative that our teaching practices 
demonstrate an effective use of researched based practices/ strategies to support oral language 
development and second language acquisition. 
Our Title III program requests that teachers plan for science concepts in the new language 
(English) as well as for the academic language required to engage in discourse and presentation. 
Therefore, our professional development for this program supports the intentional planning for 
content and language objectives as well as for oral and written language assessment and 
discourse.  
Our bilingual and ENL teachers will all be provided professional development. We will provide 
six professional development sessions (2 hours in duration) :

Teachers will integrate language and content objectives to the curriculum using recommended 
strategies for teaching of vocabulary and content to ELLs. In addition teachers will also focus on 
using various tools (technology) to make the curriculum accessible to ELLs.  
Professional development will be provided by the Assistant Principal, who has bilingual 
certification and has worked in the NYCDOE Office of ELLs previously and the ENL provider 
who has extensive knowledge of supporting ELLs, and the ENL Coordinator who also has 
extensive knowledge of supporting ELLs. 
The teachers will present their learnings to their grade teams (during study groups), as well as 
during the Dual Language Vertical Team Meetings.

 Many of our parents ask for ways of supporting their children at home, and express feeling 
challenged by new and unfamiliar content as well as a language that they may not be fluent in. 
Many already revert to their phones and Ipads as a means of supporting their children with 
reading. Therefore, we will address unfamiliar science academic content and language  with an 
affordable tool that they have access to-  (smartphones) and IPads (from school also that can go 
home). 
The parents will attend five  interactive workshops  (1.5  hours each) where they will work with 
the ENL teacher and a bilingual teacher in learning how to support their students in accessing 
complex text and content through the use of technology, while also building their content 
knowledge and resources about the unit of study.  
These pds are:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In reading, we use several assessments to measure code and meaning skills,. We desegregate the data by subgroups to 
measure:  all student progress, ELL progress, and progress for ELLs with IEPs. In addition, we also measure Spanish 
literacy growth for all students in our Dual Language Program. For students in dual language we compare literacy 
development in both the New language and the Home language, to support transference of literacy skills, and for intervention 
instructional decisions.  
 
The following formative reading assessments are used:  
The following curriculum embedded reading assessments are used for all students and are additionally  reviewed to measure 
ENL literacy progress:  
In writing, we use TCRWP Writing Development Rubric to assess students end line unit assessments for all students. Students

in the Free Standing ENL program and students receiving standalone ENL in Dual Language Setting are additionally  assessed 
using Teacher Created Constructed Response task measured by the Universal English Language Development Writing 
Rubric four  times a year. The tasks are aligned to the tasks in the NYSESLAT writing section.  
 
We also measure for oral language development for our ENLs using two tools that assess for academic discourse through 
conversations and individual academic language. The following formative assessments are used:  
Teacher teams analyze the data and created targeted action plans that support ENL grade-wide progress as well as ENL 
individual student achievement, three times a year during our Dual Language/ENL vertical team meetings and study groups.  
 
In addition our Dual Language Teachers case study struggling students  during their professional learning community - 
developing Spanish literacy - as a means of receiving collegial feedback based on students literacy data in both Spanish and 
English. Teachers compare the running records in both languages to determine - strengths in both languages, and literacy 
transference from one language to another. Teachers also identify areas for support in ENL to strengthen literacy development 
in English. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The following structures ensure that data is administered and analyzed in a timely manner so that action plans be generated, 
implemented, and progress monitored systematically, by teachers teams and administration: 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
PS 112 in an early childhood school that offers two dual language programs (DL ICT ASD NEST and DL ICT) and 
Freestanding ESL with an integrated model and standalone ENL as part of the revised part 154. 
 
We analyze and aggregate our data by subgroups and language. We compare the performance of subgroups to the whole 
grade and target areas of growth. We used knowledge of second language acquisition to review current student performance, 
and set targeted instructional goals to improve linguistic and literacy performance. Teams convene regularly, articulate 
progress towards these goals, and make adjustments to instruction and curriculum as necessary to ensure all four modalities 
are being explicitly addressed.   
 
The following summative assessments are being used to identify baselines, progress, and  areas of need for our ENL students:  
Universal Screener for code skills: DIBELS grades k-2:  
For students in dual language, these are provided in both languages (Spanish and English) to support transference, determine 
language of dominance, and language for intervention as needed.  
Baseline and end of year assessment , also MOSL choice:  
District 4 Writing Performance Task:  
Home Language Assessment in Spanish  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The following structures ensure that data is administered and analyzed in a timely manner so that interventions be generated, 
implemented, and progress monitored systematically, by teachers teams and administration: 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
According to "Creating an RtI Model for ELLs Academic Success,"The foundation for RtI for ELLs is high quality core, or Tier 1 
instruction focused on promoting language and literacy development instruction that targets the students population's 
needs". Therefore, our assessments are analyzed to determine adjustments to Tier 1, the instructional core, as well as Tier2 
and 3 as needed by individual students and groups of students.

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The ENL Data Team (comprised of AP, ENL Coordinator, Bilingual Special Education teacher, and Bilingual Teacher), review the 
following data source and determine progress across all four modalities, areas for improvements, and areas of strength:  
 
NYSESLAT Assessment: (outcome based assessment)  
Since we are en early childhood schools (prek-2), the NYS ELA and the NYS MATH assessments, do not apply to our school.

The following structures are in place:  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1a: 
PS 112 offers an integrated and stand-alone ENL model based on student proficiency level and time allotments as per 
CR Part 154. Currently, our ENL coordinator/ teacher provides both a stand-alone and integrated model in grades 
kindergarten through second. 
 
Stand-Alone Model  
As per CR Part 154.2 our ELLs are heterogeneously grouped by NYSESLAT level and homogeneously grouped by 
grade.  Stand-alone ENL instruction for: 
Students who receive stand-alone ENL instruction, convene in the ENL classroom where they receive their ENL 
services through literacy instruction addressing all four language acquisition modalities (listening, speaking, reading, 
and writing). All instruction encompasses the rigorous language standards set forth in the Common Core, as well as 
the New Language Arts Progressions.  
 
Integrated Model 
As per CR Part 154.2 ELLs are  provided with Integrated ENL instruction, grouped by grade, in the content areas of 
science and/or social studies keeping within their mandated minutes of instruction. ENL instruction is  administered 
into two classes per grade, with delivery from the ENL teacher as well as the common branch licensed teacher. The 
ENL teacher pushes  into those designated classrooms, working collaboratively with the teacher, designing lessons 
which meet the needs of the students in terms of language and content objectives. Groups of ELLs in the classrooms 
who receive Integrated ENL instruction were intentionally programmed for class placement which would allow for 
optimal delivery of services.  
Students who receive Integrated ENL instruction, receive their ENL services through science and/or social studies 
instruction addressing all four language acquisition modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). All 
instruction encompasses the rigorous language standards set forth in the Common Core, the NYCDOE Science Scope 
& Sequence, NYCDOE Social Studies Scope & Sequence, as well as the New Language Arts Progressions. This allows for 
best practices with regard to the delivery of appropriate and differentiated ENL strategies so as to ensure students

language. 
 
        

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

1c: 
PS 112 offers three Dual Language Program Models: 
All dual language models offer 50/50 Spanish, English instruction within a five day roller-coaster model. As a result 
students receive 675 minutes of  instruction in both Spanish and English language (inclusive of reading, writing, math, 
social studies, and science). 
 
As per CR Part 154,  all dual language programs offer ELL students integrated and stand-alone ENL instruction based 
on student proficiency level and mandated time allotments, thus supporting the diverse linguistic needs of all ELLs 
while also providing and exceeding the mandated minutes expected for English language instruction.  
 
Stand-Alone Model  
As per CR Part 154.2 our ELLs are heterogeneously grouped by NYSESLAT level and homogeneously grouped by 
grade.  Stand-alone ENL instruction for: 
 
Students who receive stand-alone ENL instruction, are provided this instruction inside their classrooms, by the 
bilingually certified pedagogue, through literacy instruction that  addresses all four language acquisition modalities 
(listening, speaking, reading, and writing). All instruction encompasses the rigorous language standards set forth in 
the Common Core, as well as the New Language Arts Progressions.  
Integrated Model 
As per CR Part 154.2 ELLs are  provided with Integrated ENL instruction. . Students are heterogeneously grouped 
by NYSESLAT level and homogeneously grouped by grade. 
  
   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)?

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In both programs, teachers plan intentionally for content, literacy, and language objectives using various curricula,resources, 
and data. All curriculum in aligned to the NYS CCLS, NYCDOE Science Scope and Sequence, NYCDOE Social Studies Scope and 
Sequence, and NYS  New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) and Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) . 
 
Literacy Content/ Curriculum:  
  
We meet in dual language vertical teams, study groups,a nd professional learning communities to create lessons that support 
the diverse linguistic needs for our students. As such as we continue to engage in best practices to plan intentionally for highly 
effective lessons, deliver these, and share these as exemplars to our colleagues. We: ' 
 
  
The following instructional strategies are used: (from but not limited to): 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The following assessments are used to evaluate ELLs in their home language development:  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Not Applicable- as we are a prek-2 school. 
 
5b.  
For our Newcomers, who are potentially the majority of our students, we ensure to provide differentiated instruction teachers 
intentionally plan for literacy, content, and language objectives. 
In addition, targeted language instruction is provided as part of our after school Title 3 program, as students are immersed in 
rigorous inquiry based/ science units of studies that focus on academic language development.  
 
5c:  
For students who are Developing ELLs, and students who are potential Developing ELLs,  additional targeted instruction / 
intervention is provided by a ENL or Bilingual Certified teacher as part of the RTI for ELLs model- Tier 2 services. Language/ 
literacy support is measured and supported using appropriate interventions.  
 
5d:  
As a  k-2 school, PS 112 only has students receiving services for 4 years or longer in the event that the ELL student is held over. 
Therefore, long term ELLs (which require seven years of ELL service) would also not be enrolled in our current school year.  
 
5e:  
For former ELLs, we provide all supports needed as per their data. Teachers use ESL strategies and scaffolds to ensure students 
have supports needed to access the CCLS aligned units of studies.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers continue to plan for language and literacy outcome for all students in order to provide differentiated instruction. 
Through flexible grouping, multiple entry points, and Universal by Design planning, teachers ensure IEP goals are met. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          91 

 

Teachers intentionally plan for scaffolds that allow access to all grade-level  curriculum. As an example:  
 
Targeted goals for students include language goals and language of instruction as needed, to ensure 2  n language and literacy 
progression. Teachers use both grade level texts with appropriate scaffolds for comprehension, and guided texts based on 
their level of instruction as per running records and F&P benchmark. In addition, teacher teams study and implement 
strategies for intervention. All students are immersed in rigorous CCLS aligned instruction that is developmentally and grade 
level appropriate. Texts are never "watered down", rather the scaffolds intentionally planned for and implemented allow for 
students to access the content.      
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Using guidelines from "Creating an RTI Model for ELLs’ Academic Success",  a document written in collaboration with nationally 
renowned researchers in the field of literacy and language development, we support our ELLs under the RTI structure; design 
research-based instruction that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for ELLs. Therefore: 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

According to our F&P English Data, 50% of our 1st grade ELLs moving to second grade next year and who are  Expanding ELLs, 
just bench marked at independent level I (benchmark I and J, I being the minimal). With more appropriate 
materials that support their linguistic as well as their literacy needs, we expect more accelerated growth. Therefore, to best 
support our expanding students literacy development, particularly in  comprehension and vocabulary, we are implementing:

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are included in all school programs. They all are programmed to participate in the diverse arts programs we offer such 
as: 
Our ELLs are included in our technology lab once a week. In addition our Title III Program utilizes technology integration as part 
of the instruction to best supports student's academic language development through engagement, by providing access to 
curriculum through multi- media forms.  All students inclusive of ELLs are scheduled for library/ media, and science specials, 
one period a week,  as the rest of the school. 
 
 
Our Second Grade Dual Language classes, as well as all of our second  grade classes,  are also scheduled for swimming and 
soccer,  through our collaboration with Asphalt Green.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We have  Language Team, comprised of Administrator who holds bilingual masters,  ENL provider/ coordinator, who is a highly 
effective licensed practioner, Bilingual Special Education early childhood teacher, and early childhood bilingual teacher,  who 
works collaboratively to ensure all ELLs are provided with developmentally appropriate services and resources. This team 
meets periodically to review students, services, program. and resources.  
 
In addition, the ENL Coordinator and Assistant principal collaborate with the school secretary, and parent coordinator, upon 
admission, to ensure that all newly arrived ELLs are provided with appropriate grade, resources, and instruction. Parent 
interview, student interview (conducted only by licensed pedagogue),  and documentation are used to help determine the 
students' placement and services.   
 
For ELLs already registered  in NYC public schools, the school secretary and administration review student document, ATS, 
records, and will call previous school as needed to ensure the correct program as well as resources are provided. For ELLs who 
have IEPs and are transferring to the school, the IEP teacher and the principal review the students' goals and services to ensure 
the student receives the correct placement and services as required.       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Not applicable. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,

18.a. 
We offer three Two-Way Immersion, Dual Language Models that address the diverse linguistic and 
literacy needs of the students, as well as the various learning disabilities :  
 
Each program has its own unique composition. Dual Language ICT program fosters language development 
inclusive of students with IEPs- learning disabilities and/ or language impairments. All programs strive for 
class organizations with a balance of language models as much as possible. However, mandates precede 
anything else such as ELLs, IEPs and NEST requirements. The program descriptions are as follows:   
18.b.and 18.c. 
Our Two-Way Immersion models intentionally plan for rigorous and yet authentic learning opportunities 
that promote oracy and literacy development through content area instruction in two languages; while 
also promoting culturally competency.  
 18.d. 
Our dual language programs aim to establish strong foundations for bilingualism and bi-literacy. Many of 
our students have language and / or literacy delays, therefore we teach explicit literacy instruction 
(phonics and reading) sequentially for our DL kindergarten students and for our first graders during their 
first semester. Out first and second graders receive simultaneous literacy instruction.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development for all ELL Personnel:  
(ENL and Dual Language Teachers) 
 
As a result, of the complexity of our programs, our teachers need to become highly effective in implementing instructional 
practices that meet the needs of our diverse population, while ensuring language experiences that promote oral language and 
literacy development in both languages through content rich curriculum.  
Professional Learning Opportunities  
 
We are engaging in the following learning opportunities this year:  
 
Professional Development for all Personnel:  
(All Teachers and service providers) 
 
Professional Development for Specialized  Personnel:  
(Reading Teachers and SIT Committee Members) 
 
Response to Intervention for ELLs Professional Learning Community: This PLC  supports school-wide implementation of 
Response to Intervention (RtI) structure that is responsive to the linguistic and cultural needs of all students, particularly 
English Language Learners (ELLs). Based on the webinars and institutes delivered by Harvard School of Education in 
collaboration with the NYCDOE Office of English Language Learners from 2012-2014, and under the guidance of our assistant 
principal who was trained and presented the RtI for ELLs Institutes city-wide during 2013-2014, our school will continue to

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The following professional development time slots have been set for professional development requirements as per CR Part 
154.2. All of these professional development opportunities are included in our school-wide PD Plan 2017-2018 and have team 
members assigned for facilitation.  Agendas and attendance are generated and provided to administration, inclusive of next 
steps and resources requested. Resources inclusive of outside workshops, texts, and consultants are provided as needed and

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All parents of ELLs receive orientation about their program model where we ensure our parents understand our goals, 
expectations, and services / supports for students for their language development throughout the disciplines. 
All parents of ELLs receive ongoing  supports understanding of program expectations, curricula, and resources to assist 
students in language and literacy development:  
All  parents of ELLs have at least 1 additional data conferences (aside from parent orientation and PTC) to discuss:  
The dual language teams have Spanish speaking teachers (which is a great portion of our population). Our ENL provider is a 
speaker of three languages- French, German, and Chinese- and therefore can provide translations as needed in these 
languages (she services most of ENL students in Freestanding ESL program) and there are teachers in the building who are 
fluent Arabic speakers. In addition, translation services are used when we do not have representatives form our school who 
speak that language. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent Involvement 
  
We collaborate closely with our parents to create an environment of trust, respect, and mutual support. Therefore, we have 
on-going discussions and surveys with our families in order to create learning opportunities and meetings which foster student 
academic achievement and well-being.  
  
Monthly Dual Language Meetings will be led by dual language teacher teams on Tuesday during Parent Involvement Days. 
Teams will create a school-wide survey for parents of ELLs, offering them a menu of items, issues, and learning opportunities 
connected to DL & ENL learning, and then this data will be used to inform us about the topics of interest.  
  
There will be workshops for Parents of English language learners regarding:  
  
There will be workshops for Parents of students who are learning Spanish and English: Supporting Spanish Language 
Development and Supporting English Language Development through: 
  
Spanish Social Afternoon, will be an event offered twice in the year to promote the Spanish Language as well as the Spanish 
Speaking cultural heritages. Team of teachers and parents will create and host an afternoon of “Celebraciones Latinas” where 
families immerse themselves in an afternoon of various events that celebrate the Spanish language, the traditions, dances, 
music, arts, oral stories and foods, from various Latin American countries.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Eileen Reiter, Principal , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At the time of registration all parents who are new to NYCDOE are asked when filling out the HLIS in what 
language do they want to receive information from the school. Based on their response, we compile a list of the 
languages in our school, and provide information in the languages available in the DOE. Additionally, we have staff 
members who are fluent in Spanish, Chinese, French, and Arabic. When information needs to be translated we 
either send it to the translation unit, or call the number at the translation unit so that immediate information can 
be provided to the families. Every year our parent coordinator sends a survey home to inquire about the needs of 
the community in order to plan workshops around these needs. In the questionnaire, the language of preference 
is requested in order for the school to address these needs.

interpretation service(s)?  

A majority of our multilingual parents 
are speakers of Spanish. We have 
many trained and licensed bilingual 
pedagogues who are available to 
interpret and translate with our 
Spanish-speaking parents. When a 
language other than Spanish is 
requested for a meeting, we use over-
the-phone services provided by the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit.  

Letters for Curriculum Night are sent 
home in the parents' preferred 
language using the services provided 
by Translation & Interpretation Unit. 
Upon meeting with parents on 
Curriculum Night, Dual Language 
pedagogues present information in 
both languages (English & Spanish),

evaluation meetings) 

 

 

   

 

and for all other classroom personnel, 
information is presented in English 
accompanied by related informational 
materials translated into the parents' 
preferred language using the services 
provided by Translation & 
Interpretation Unit.  
 

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Trained and licensed bilingual pedagogues will reach out to families in their language of preference in the event of an 
emergency. If a trained, licensed bilingual pedagogue is unavailable in a given language to translate, over-the-phone 
services furnished by the Language Interpretation Unit will be utilized. Emergency contact cards in the parents' 
preferred language with student info (name, photo, etc) are mandated to be kept with teachers and staff upon exiting 
the building in the event of an emergency, thereby ensuring all students and their families stay informed and within 
contact in their preferred language. Securing student information and keeping information up-to-date is a priority.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At the beginning of the school year and throughout, teachers and staff are made aware of the various language and 
interpretation services available to them via emails, links, personnel meetings, postings, and distribution of fliers 
outlining translation procedures. Teachers & staff are trained by the ENL Coordinator on protocols necessary to access 
these services using various methods of communication (email, in-person training sessions, common prep meetings, 
etc). We use information collected from the HLIS (Home Language Information Survey) to inform teachers of their 
students' parents' preferred language(s) in order for them to communicate with families most efficiently and 
effectively. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

In September parents whose primary language is not a covered language within the DOE, nine most popular 
languages in NYC and who require language assistance services are provided with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights 
and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. Translated versions 
of documents are available for parents who request it. We have posted signs throughout the main entrance, cafeteria, 
school exits, main office indicating the ability of translation services. Information posters or sent home with the 
students carry an addendum. That states that the school will provide documents in other languages as needed and 
requested by the parent.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our Parent Coordinator in collaboration with our AP, ENL Coordinator, and DL teacher will revise parent survey to 
include feedback on the quality and availability of the services.  

PC with PTA will ask for oral and written feedback via surveys available in the parents' preferred language(s).
