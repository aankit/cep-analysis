Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement?

In essence we are preparing students to become lifelong learners and productive citizens to meet the challenges of 
the twenty-first century. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The professional learning community at PS 92 is dedicated to developing the mastery of basic grade level skills in all 
students through targeted instruction that is inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. Our purpose is to educate all students to a higher level of academic performance, to help students set

collaboratively to provide students with the best educational experience possible. There is a strong relationship 
between the home, staff and the administrative team as evidenced by the NYC School Survey and multiple school 
initiatives. There is a strong partnership with Harlem Children's Zone that promotes healthy Harlem a program that 
encourages healthy eating habits among children and families as a whole. In addition,they also collaborate with our 
school in promoting other educational programs that enrich the educational experience of our students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Mary McLeod Bethune School, PS 92M, is a barrier free elementary school located in Central Harlem, New York 
City. The Pre-Kindergarten to 5th grade school serves approximately 300 children from culturally diverse backgrounds. 
Our doors are open to immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, South America and Yemen. In 
addition, a small segment of our community comes from Puerto Rico, and the vast majority is African-American. The 
student population includes Students with Disabilities (SWD) and English as a New Language (ENL). The school 
building is a well-kept beautiful modern building, where pride in the students’ accomplishments is evident in the 
prominently displayed student work. Another very unique characteristic of PS 92M is that we share the building with 
a middle school, St. Hope Academy and a high school, Democracy Preparatory School.  

Mary McLeod Bethune offers a variety of instructional programs. We have the traditional general education 
classrooms, and also offer smaller specialized classroom instruction. The average size class in grades K-1 ranges from 
15-20. In the upper grades, the class size ranges from 20-30. The students are heterogeneously grouped within each 
grade.  

The principal, assistant principals and 80 percent of the teaching staff have been at PS 92 for more than six years and 
there is a high level of commitment demonstrated by administration, staff and the community towards increasing 
student academic performance. PS 92 has engaged in intensive staff development in order to provide children with 
instruction of the highest quality, especially in English Language Arts (ELA), specifically Writing. Our mission is:?The

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Mary McLeod Bethune has made the most growth in communicating high expectations and providing training to the 
entire staff based on the Quality Review Report. Teacher teams and staff establish a culture for learning that 
systematically communicates a unified set of high expectations for all students, and provide clear, focused, and 
effective feedback. 

In our trajectory to show growth among all students, especially our special education students and our English 
Language Learners our teachers continue to work diligently to provide rigorous instruction to all learners. This school 
year we will further develop our Project Based Learning Units and our Writing Units to so that they are embedded 
with relevant rigorous tasks and activities that will promote improved student performance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Reflecting upon the 2017-2018 plan: 

During the 2017-2018 school year, PS 92 implemented many positive changes. The strength of our plan was 
maximizing resources to provide strategic rigorous instruction to all students. The learning community collaborated to 
create an inclusive culture and climate where there is mutual trust among staff, students and parents. In addition, the 
administrative team established professional development opportunities for the staff, fostering a culture of high 
expectations for all members of the learning community. Assistant principal guided teachers in becoming 
collaborative and using teacher teams to improve their analysis of student work and to better provide targeted 
rigorous instruction and to build capacity in improving student writing throughout our school. 

Developing the 2018-2019 plan: 

The plan is being developed through careful reflection of the results of the 2017-2018 plan, administrative 
observation, principal performance observation data and New York State test results, the Framework for 
GreatSchools. - Rigorous Instruction 2015 we scored 79% on the Quality of Student Discussion and 86% in Common 
Core Shifts in Math, and the 2015-2016 Quality Review revealed a rating of developing in Pedagogy 

The principal is, and continues to be in frequent dialogue with the members of the PS 92 School Leadership team (SLT) 
as well as with the school’s Lead teachers and staff in general. A professional learning community has been 
established with three distinct teams, the Writing team, Math team and Reading team. Writing is of high priority and 
as a result a theory of action is being implemented to address the poor performance of our students in Writing. 
Planning sessions are being utilized to draw from all representatives of the PS 92 professional learning community. 
The plan will be posted on the district’s website. It will be shared with the entire learning community including 
parents and Community Based Organizations {CBO’s) through informational meetings scheduled by the school. The 
plan will be explained and questions from the parents and community members will be answered. Spanish translation 
will be provided. In addition, grade level team and teacher teams will be monitored closely by the administrative in an 
effort to strengthen teachers knowledge of content and pedagogy, which will impact planning and preparation that 
will meet district standards and foster teachers providing instruction that will benefit all students.  

 

The school’s needs are as follows:

activities, lesson adaptations, and a targeted instructional model that takes individual and small groups into 
account, including English Language Learners and students with Individualized Education Plans. Thus 
transforming classrooms into student centered environments. 

6.  Strengthen teachers’ content knowledge and pedagogical practices in the use of purposeful learning 

extensions and in the use of questioning and discussion techniques so that practices align with our 
instructional vision and all learners are engaged in high quality discussions and tasks. 

7.  Deepen teachers’ skills in the use of daily formative assessment data to make instructional adjustments and 

ensure that students make progress toward mastery of explicitly stated and standard aligned learning 
objectives. 
Integrate Project Based Learning, infused with technology to make accountable differences in instruction, 
learning, assessment, and management of students’ progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

After reviewing the 2016 - 2017 School Quality Snapshot, the school received a 72% in the area of Rigorous instruction 

As a school we need to: 

· To continue to strengthen the teaching practices across classrooms to reflect the use of adequate scaffolds "Bite 
Size", interactive activities, lesson adaptations, aggressive monitoring and a targeted instructional model that takes 
individual and small groups into account, including English Language Learners and students with Individualized 
Education Plans. Thus transforming classrooms into student centered environments where all learners needs are 
taken into account. 

· Strengthen teachers’ content knowledge and pedagogical practices in the use of purposeful learning extensions and 
increasing rigor and engagement in their instruction that aligns with the school's instructional vision; all learners are 
engaged in high quality discussions and tasks that is differentiated. Also, after reviewing the Spring 2018 ELA and 
Math data, we will continue to implement a theory of action to increase teachers’ repertoire of strategies for teaching 
students to write for varied purposes and audiences that reflects the craft structure of the genre and is in alignment 
with the CCLS so that there will be an increase in student performance in Writing with a focus on SWD. 

· Deepen teachers’ skills in the use of daily formative assessment data, aggressive monitoring to make instructional 
adjustments and ensure that students make progress toward mastery of explicitly stated and standard aligned 
learning objectives. 

. Implement Restorative circle across the curriculum to provide positive spaces for students to access content 
knowledge and to showcase their understandings. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The SLT reflected on the goals for the 2017 – 2018 school year and reviewed the degree to which our school 
effectively communicates it goals, mission and vision to entire learning community, especially parents. A key factor in 
building capacity is by establishing and maintaining a welcoming, encouraging learning environment, and developing 
partnerships with families, businesses, and community based organizations. Included in this review is the Elementary 
School Quality Snapshot NYC School Survey 2015 and the 2015– 2016 QR which indicates that 90% of parents are 
satisfied with the education that their child has received and that the school leaders consistently communicate high 
expectations to all stake holders. The SLT would like to see 100% parent satisfaction. This data suggests that parents 
would welcome more information about the curriculum their children are learning, develop an understanding of how 
they are learning and become equipped with strategies they can use at home to further support their child in meeting 
learning targets. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the administrative team and parent coordinator will revise and improve the structures in place to actively 
engage parents in the instructional practices and assessment practices of the school so that parents will become more 
effective learning partners in supporting their children to achieve academic success evidenced by a 10% increase in the 
2019 school survey question related to parents satisfaction about their child's education .

conducted outside of school as well as on-site with a focus on collaborative engagement around Measure of Teacher 
of Practice and its role in improving teacher effectiveness so that all teachers can be rated as “highly effective” and 
teacher teams. In addition, the school will continue to strengthen existing relationships with nearby educational 
institutions that provide high quality teacher education programs (City College, Teachers College and Bank Street 
College) in order to access quality newly certified teachers who could potentially evolve into highly qualified teachers. 
Continued support will also be elicited from the BSFC. The administrative team will engage in ongoing review of 
faculty qualification to ensure that certification mandates are being met according to state requirements. In addition, 
faculty will be provided with ongoing targeted professional development based on ADVANCE data. To build teacher

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
On-going professional development will take place throughout the year to develop and sustain teachers’ expertise in 
the area of assessment and data analysis. These training sessions will allow teacher the opportunity to look at the 
different types of assessments administered to our students and their purpose. It will then be demonstrated how the 
accurate analysis of the available data can help to diagnose learning issues and provide for remedial instruction.  

The MOSL team and the ILT team is comprised of teachers who collaborate and make informed decisions to improve 
student performance. 

In addition there will be scheduled ongoing professional development that will include activities that are geared 
towards expanding teachers schema in the designing coherent instruction, delivery of instruction as per the Common 
Core Learning Standards as measured that evidences rigor and engagement. Some professional development 
activities will take place in classrooms during inter-visitation. Other professional development activities will include 
discussion of professional articles, weekly collaborative planning on grade level, during teacher team meetings and 
teacher observations. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. PS 
92/Mary Mcleod Bethume, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible 
for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, 
Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. Parents will 
continue to participate in workshops on the curriculum being implemented (Go Math, ReadyGen, TCWP). Parents will continue to be 
involved in every last"Thursday of the Month" visit to the classroom. Parents will earn scholar dollars for their kids for attending Parent 
Teacher Conferences. These scholar dollars can be redeemed in the scholar dollar store. The "Fathers Club" will be continued where 
fathers receive movie tickets after attending at least three school activities for the term.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 92/Mary McLeod Bethune will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Act (ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The beginning o fthe year (BOY) NYC performance tasks - English Language Arts (ELA) is being used across the grades K-5 as 
one of its formative assessments for all the students including the English Language Learners (ELL).  This assessment is 
comprised of both the Reading Inventory assessing the early literacy of students on three traits - print concepts, letter 
recognition and naming, phonics and word recognition.  The Informational Writing task assesses the students' writing skills on 
four traits - details, development, grammar  and usage and conventions for the lower grades.  The upper grades students' are 
assessed based on their reading abilities of identifying - main ideas and supporting details and using this information to write 
an Opinion essay.  This should include facts and evidence from articles and using those with linking words and phrases in 
connecting their ideas and reasons with introductory and concluding paragraphs.  The students have to use correct grammar 
and vocabulary, capilization, punctuation and spelling in this writing task.

The Free Standing ENL/ESL program uses Student Notebooks, learning Logs,  Reflection Journals and individual checklists to 
collect data about each English Language Learner's proficiency development  according to instructional planning. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The school's teacher teams support this effort.  In the past years, as an out-of-classroom staff (ESL teacher), I had been a 
member of the Kindergarten teacher team.  As a part of this team, teachers collaborate to identify students including ELLs and 
plan for instruction.  We create SMART goals for groups of students including ELLs and plan relevant instructional 
activities.  After each unit, we assess the students for growth in their literacy skills. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Tests NYSESLAT together with the State ELA for ELLs in the 
testing grades, as well as the End of Year (EOY) NYC Performance Tasks are all being used to identify baseline, growth and 
areas of need of development in the ELLs’ language proficiency. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

P.S. 92 uses projections based on the baseline assessments plus the data gathered from the summative assessments for all the 
students including ELLs with or without disabilities. The school, also uses and interprets Annual Measurable Achievement 
Objectives AMAO results for planning instructions in the regular day ESL program and after school programs, too. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Like in most remediation programs, the deficiencies and skills or the weaknesses and strengths of the ELLs are taken into 
consideration and assessed in planning intervention instructional instruction for them accordingly. We look at the data and 
analyze them to follow up the progress of individual students or provide more remedial instructions. An experienced staff 
member who is also a “Reading Rescue” provider this preceding school year, implements two types of assessments within the 
framework of RtI,  i.e. universal screeners and on-going progress monitoring tools to identify eligible students including ELLs 
for the 3 types or tiers of intervention: universal, targeted, and intensive interventions. As RtI supports differentiated 
instructions that are matched to students’ needs including our ELLs, our school will incorporate more increasingly intensive 
and one on one interventional activities for identified students as the case may be. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As in the previous school years, aggregate data from the results of the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math as well as the EOY NYC 
Performance Tasks are taken into consideration to evaluate and inform the only one ELL program at P.S. 92 which is the Free 
Standing ENL/ESL program for Grades k thru 5. For example, by simply looking at the RLAT from the ATs, one will see a list of 
all entitled ELLs. It also shows the last 3 school year’s results of an ELL’s scores in each subtest or competency of the NYSESLAT: 
Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing plus the decision, whether the student is at the Entering, Emerging, Transitional or 
Expanding proficiency level. The NYSITELL or LAB-R information showing the year, the raw scores, and levels of language 
development for each ELL are also reflected in the same ATS Exam History Report. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

As the data show, it will be manageable to create a programmatic schedule for all the entitled ELLs based on their grades and 
language proficiency levels from the last Spring administration of the NYSESLAT. Considering the aggregate results from the 
last 3 years and analyzing the competency level of a student in a given subtest, it is easier to plan for differentiated instructions 
and remediation or even providing additional support to the ELLs in the program.

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The organizational or instructional models being followed in our school’s only ELL program, i.e. the Free Standing 
ENL/ESL program are the combined push-in and pull out together with the collaborative language and content 
instructions with the school’s cluster teachers’ programs like Science and Arts Education. In terms of program models, 
there are some groups which are heterogeneous: mixed proficiency levels and mixed grades (only 2 contiguous 
grades) or homogeneous ones, e.g. all Expanding ELLs in the 4th grade including 2 EP (Commanding) students who 
tested out of the program based on the Spring 2015 NYSESLAT are served as one group in a pull-out model on some 
days and push-in model on other days. Grades K and 1 ELLs who are both entering and emerging are served as one 
group and all 5th grade ELLs are served as well using the pull out model with differentiated instructions to target their 
levels of language proficiency and development. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The implementation of mandated minutes of ENL/ESL instruction across the grades (K-5) with different language proficiencies 
is always a challenge and  evident in the beginning of the school year for a school offering only the Free Standing ENL/ESL 
program. To address this issue of scheduling of ELLs and other school responsibilities that require time management within an 
ELL program and its purposes, the ENL/ESL teacher will create a working schedule based on the language proficiency levels 
first of a given grade, i.e. the one given above for all 4th grade students who happen to be in the same level of language 
development. Another way to ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided is to consider ELLs in 2 
contiguous grades with the same language proficiency levels, i.e. students who are at the Entering and Emerging levels of 
language development can be grouped together.   
 
Since both push-in and collaborative teaching are being implemented, e.g. for all 4th grade ELLs, ESL and ELA minutes are 
explicitly delivered for that particular group. The pull out model will be implemented this school year for the most part by the 
standalone ENL program as it will flexibly meet the mandated minutes of instructions for the ELLs each week particularly in 
two contiguous grades. For example, a group of all Expanding ( Advanced) third grade and fourth grade students will meet 4 
times a week to meet their mandated ESL service for a total of 180 minutes. This can be followed with co-planning with their 
classroom teachers for a period of follow-up push-in instruction each week in each class to reinforce and support their ELA 
learning, especially in the area of Vocabulary development and Writing.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The pull out set up will extend and scaffold reading and writing skills, academic and content area concepts and vocabulary 
activities of the ELLs,  introduced by the ELLs’ classroom teachers during those periods of collaboration with support and 
remediation or enhanced independent or small group activities/assignments from the ESL teacher pushing-in. Differentiated 
and individualized instructions come into play, core contents become more comprehensible, and the demands of the CCLS are 
met. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The school does not have either the Bilingual Education or Dual Language program, we do not evaluate our ELLs in their native 
or home languages. Administering the Spanish LAB to our Spanish-speaking ELLs periodically may be an option for our school 
to evaluate them in that home language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Differentiation for these ELL subgroups can come in different ways and means (processes) at all 5 levels of language 
development (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding) using both receptive and productive language 
activities. During the last school year with the introduction of the “Project Based Learning”(PBL) which will continue this school 
year, students including ELLs in each grade and class will be engaged in thematic and cross-curricular activities with end-results 
or projects that are pretty much their own choosing as streamlined in their classroom discussions during mini-lessons. In the 
Free Standing ENL/ESL program itself, teacher-created ELL packets containing activities on initial reading, decoding, and other 
Phonics activities are given to newcomers or students less than 3 years in the program. TPR and other audio-visual activities 
are also used for them. If a SIFE ELL comes in during the school year, his/her English language acquisition needs will be 
addressed appropriately by providing him/her Oracy and Literacy Links activities using grade level texts and appropriate 
supports according to the New Language Arts Progressions. This school year, push-in periods will be assigned for the ELLs who 
have been receiving 4 to 6 years of ESL service to support them in their classroom activities and assignments bearing in mind 
that most of them are in the testing grades and are in need of test-preparation support. Additional individual assignments 
requiring exit projects showing the students’ writing skills will be given, too. As to the former ELLs (Commanding), the ESL/ENL 
teacher will extend 90 minutes/week of language support by including these particular students in small grouping in the 
classrooms and giving them individualized enrichment and challenging projects. Testing accommodations will also be extended 
to this subgroup of ELLs in the testing grades.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For some ELL-SWDs, the TESOL certified teacher of the school collaborates and attends IEP meetings with other related-
services providers like Speech and SETTS/IEP teacher, and the school Psychologist to ensure programmatic ESL instruction is 
recommended in the IEPs for such sub-group of ELLs. Grade level and age appropriate materials and activities are provided 
that will augment their language development, e.g. “Oxford Picture Dictionary in the Content Areas”, Wilson’s “Fundations” 
Student Books and Workbooks of different levels, Educator’s Publishing’s “Explode the Code” according to the ELL-SWDs’ 
grade levels, and the use of TPR and multi-sensory approaches will be utilized to provide and support their access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English language development for the same students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
This sub-group of students is included in the groupings and scheduling of regular ELLs in the Free Standing ESL program of the 
school. There is full participation in all activities for all ELL-SWDs in our school. They fully participate in all programs offered by 
the school. Other than the ESL recommemdation in their IEPs, these same students receive Speech Therapy, Occupational 
Therapy (OT), Physical Therapy (PT), SETTS and other related services like Adaptive Physical Education (APE) if they are 
identified for such extra curricular activities. 
The total development of all students is the embodiment of the mission of our school-“We accept the responsibility to teach 
all students so they may attain their maximum potential academically, socially, emotionally, and physically.” In essence, we are 
preparing students to become career-ready and life-long learners and contributing members of our society regardless of 
their  categories and or disabilities. Specific to the class assignments, ICT and bridge classes are formed for flexible 
programming that enable diverse student population including ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals academically and attain 
English language proficiency within the least restrictive environment. Total integration in all the curricular and instructional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

offerings of the school for this sub-group of ELLs is the prime consideration in placing them in the Integrated Collaborative 
Teaching (ICT) classes accordingly. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The preceding school year saw the implementation of more structured test preparation programs for all students in the testing 
grades with the inclusion of ELLs both during the regular day and after school programs for ELA and Math State Tests that will 
continue this school year. Now on its 10th year, our school’s Content Instruction Through English (CITE) Title III after school 
program for both the early grades and testing grades groups of participating ELLs will once again take care and reinforce 
themes/units of study and topics in the content areas including writing in Math and the introduction of Science Club. As the 
school piloted the Project Based Learning (PBL) as part of its curriculum in the beginning of the previous school year in the 
Third grade and extended it across the grades at the end of the school year with a successful celebration and inter-visitation of 
classes for students to appreciate each other’s culminating projects.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
As we just piloted and implemented in the preceding school year, the “Project Based Learning” (PBL) initiative will be 
considered for the upcoming school year as a school-wide curricular program. P.S. 92 will also continue with the “ i-Ready” 
program to include all classes across the grades. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

The school never had a Bilingual or Dual Language program in the last 10 years or so.             
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All of our ELLs are given the same opportunity to avail of whatever school programs they are entitled to. 
Be in the Speech and Language program or SETTS with other eligible students in smaller groups or settings. Our  school Social 
Worker and school Psychologist are also available to extend their services to any of our ELLs as they deem them necessary. 
After school and supplemental services like the one mentioned in Question #8, i.e. the Content Instruction Through  English 
(CITE) being implemented under the Title III Federal grants are always open to our ELLs across the grades (K-5). The parents or 
guardians are informed about the availability of any after school or test preparation program being offered in the school or in 
the district for them to register their  ELL children. Other than the CITE after school program, the school has partnered with the 
Harlem Children Zone (HCZ) which is a community-based organization (CBO) that offers after school activities like homework 
help, cooking, arts, dancing, sports and even test preparations wherein some of our classroom teachers are hired to work. 
Such CBO like Harlem Children Zone welcomes our ELLs and gives them equal access to their available programs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The preceding school year, P.S. 92 started implementing the “i-Ready” program in the upper grades and this upcoming school 
year, all other lower grades will be included.  The Curriculum Associates (CA) describes this program accordingly:  “As the 
presence of technology grows in schools, computer adaptive tests (CATs) are emerging as the perfect tool for collecting rich 
data  on student ability and capturing the deep insights teachers need to make differentiated instruction a reality.” CA 
continues by saying that adaptive assessments are not new, but the growing presence of technology in schools has made it 
more feasible and common with the availability of computer technology. The i-Ready Diagnostic uses sophisticated technology 
to provide a customized evaluation of every student’s ability including that of an ELL. And how do adaptive assessments work? 
These tests match the levels of difficulty of questions/test items to the ability of each student. “As students answer questions 
correctly, the test gets more difficult. As students answer questions incorrectly, the test gets easier to find the precise ability of 
the test taker.” Tests activities can be taken in both Math and ELA and other content areas. 
In the core content areas, like Social Studies and Science, instructional materials based of the NYC DOE’s Scope and Sequence 
are being used, e.g. 4 Units of Social Studies materials from the Office of Curriculum Instruction and Professional Learning 
(CIPL) were adapted by our 4th grade classroom +-3 professions along the STEM’s line.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Since our school implements only one ELL program which is the Free Standing ENL/ESL program, as it was mentioned in 
Question 4, we do not have an official home language assessment, but may opt to use the Spanish LAB for our Spanish-
speaking ELLs on a needs-basis only.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

For our ENL/ESL resources and other learning materials, they are carefully read and reviewed from the catalogs and 
complimentary copies and samples given and presented by the approved vendors from the FAMIS list. They are later approved 
by the administration  for use in the ENL program for their age and grade-level appropriateness. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
P.S. 92/Mary McLeod building which houses our elementary school- Pre K thru Grade 5, shares its facilities and resources with 
two Charter schools: St. Hope Middle School and Democracy Prep High School. Through principals’ meetings and 
agreements,  the administrations of all 3 schools coordinate efforts to ensure that there is an equitable usage of  resources 
such as the main library  ( for academic and linguistic needs of the ELLs), the auditorium and gymnasium (for socio-emotional 
needs of the ELLs) and other facilities such as the cafeteria and playgrounds for other functions and needs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
If ELLs enrolled before the beginning of the school year, informal orientation for the parents is given telling them about the 
available ELL programs and other services and extra-curricular activities being offered by the school. This year in coordination 
with the parent coordinator, the school’s designated Language Access Coordinator (LAC) used and  displayed “Welcome” and 
“Achieve NYC” posters on the side wall of the school’s entrance as well as a “Language Identification Guide” on the front desk 
on the main office to inform parents or guardians of the availability of language assistance services. The same informational 
campaign will be used for the upcoming school year. A new Social Worker is readily available for initial socialization activities of 
the ELLs.  Also, as in the past, a tour of the school and its facilities is being done for the ELLs in the beginning and throughout 
the school year. All newly enrolled ELLs are given priority for participation in the Title III supplemental services like the long-
running Content Instruction Through English (CITE) after school program. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

As of the upcoming school year, there are no language electives being offered to the ELLs. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A to our school.   
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

 The school will participate fully in all Borough Field Support Center (Manhattan) and District-wide sponsored professional 
development activities by sending the ESL teacher and classroom teachers of ELLs to those scheduled events under the ELL 
Department or related educational agencies or as they become available for registration and with the approval of the principal. 
The preceding school year, the ENL/ESL teacher participated in a six-part series of professional learning opportunities 
organized and presented by the Manhattan Field Support Center (FSC) for all ELL Leads in Districts 1 and 5. This upcoming 
school year, the ENL/ESL teacher will attend and participate a similar professional development activities under the auspices of 
the Manhattan FSC or the District 5 Office. Such workshops intend to facilitate continuous learning among ELL educators aim 
at developing their capacity to serve ELLs and prepare them to design scaffolded learning for ELLs and to implement 
instruction that will accelerate the target population’s language development, e.g. designing student-centered instruction and 
differentiation, focusing on the ELLs’ academic vocabulary and literacy across the disciplines, from oral discourse to academic 
writing based on the goals of the Common Core Learning Standards. Our Pupil Accounting Secretary attends workshops as well 
during the school year to update himself or herself of the latest information on student data and record-keeping and other 
ATS-related developments. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Most of our classroom teachers have more than ten years of teaching to their credit, so they must have satisfied the number 
of required hours for ELL-related professional development. Our ENL/ESL teacher for the Free Standing ESL Program has both 
permanent NYS Education Department Certification and NYC DOE License in TESOL K-12 and registered during his birth month 
with the NYS Education Department for re-accreditation for the next 5 years. All of our teachers did the same State 
certification registration and to report their hours of professional development as required. The school payroll secretary keeps 
a yearly log of all the PDs attended by the teachers and this year we adhered to the recommended amount of time and 
contents of professional trainings and workshops for the ENL teacher, the new teachers, and all other staff members as 
prescribed by the CR Part 80-“it must provide professional development hours for all teachers and administrators that 
specifically address the needs of English Language Learners (ELLs). A minimum of 15% of the required PD hours for all teachers 
must be dedicated to language acquisition, including  a  focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating 
language and content instruction. For all bilingual educationand ENL/ESL, a minimum of 50% of the required professional 
learning opportunities hours  must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core-content area instruction, 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching and integrated language and content instruction for the ELLs. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
As we have done in the preceding school year, the school this upcoming school year during the window for sending parent 
notification letters for continued entitlement of ELLs and initial entitlement for new ELLs as well as transferred students, the 
ENL/ESL teacher in a separate communication to the parents or guardians of these same  students, will inform them of annual 
individual meetings to discuss programmatic goals, their children’s progress and the results of language proficiency 
assessments, e.g. NYSESLAT as well as other language development needs in the content areas and other related matters. 
As part of the Title III grant application, a certain amount will be allocated for parent activities including interpretation and 
translation services. Most of these activities will be done after school or preferably 
during the school’s Tuesday Parent Engagement of teachers or on any date as preferred by the parents 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

As always, the administration and school staff enjoin all parents to participate in all student activities inside and outside the 
school that include our ELLs. The end-of-the school year trip to Sesame Place this school year past gathered a good number of 
parent volunteers and chaperons. We have an active and functioning Parent Coordinator’s office that provide information and

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rosa Davila, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school determines the primary or home language spoken by the parents through informal 
interviews/conversations and by looking at the information they provided in the "ethnicity form" during their 
children's registration. The school confirms this information by the validation of the Home Language Information 
(HLIS) by the certified ESL teacher/NYSITELL coordinator (trained on this intake process).If a language spoken by a 
parent is other than English, the school avails of assistance from among the staff members and or other parenrs 
available through the parent coordinator and the parents association of the school, so that the parent can 
communicate effectively with the school in a timely manner.The parent coordinator, also creates a monthly 
calendar containing each school day's relevant activities and information sent to the parents with the Spanish 
translation or any other major language if it needs be. .  
 

 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

Written Preferred  

Percent Written  

 

 

Oral Preferred  

Percent Oral  

 

 

Language  

Since the school traditionally 
enrolls about 5 to 10 % of 
students with Spanish as 
their home language, it 
disseminates circulars, 
notices, and parent 
notifications in that 
language regularly.Through 
the years, the school 
registers other students 
whose parents speak other 
major languages such as 
Arabic, Chinese, and French 
(less than 5% total each 
year). Through the parents 
association meetings and 
through the office of the 
coordinator, these findings 
were reported to the school 
community.With these 
languages and other low-
incident languages, the 
school requests from the 
DOE's Translation and 
Interpretation Unit versions 
of letters and forms sent to 
those parents to address 
their needs.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

How do you plan to translate? 
Include procedures to ensure 
timely provision of translated 

documents to parents.

Month/Frequency Distributed to 

Families  

 

As the internet is readily available and 
accessible for this kind of transmission of 
communication, the school avails of 
translated standard and form letters from 
the DOE's specific website, e.g. the ELL 
Department. Foreign (other than English) 
versions are then printed and sent to 
parents together with the English version., 
so they can be responsibly informed of their 
choices and or options.As the need arises, 
other written translation services are 
referred to the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit or the DOE's contracted 
vendor directly.Monthly schedule of 
activities highlighting important events, 
assessments, parent-teacher conference 
announcements,availability of educational 
services and programs, and observance of 
holidays are sent home in the beginning of 
the month or several days before the school 
events happen with translation in Spanish 
or French. The parent coordinator prepares 
the monthly calendar in Spanish and a 
Spanish-speaking staff members 
proofread/correct it for final printing and 
dissemination. The school also provides 
appropriate signages, posters and forms 
and letters especially during important 
events like parent-teacher conferences and 
other school meetings, after school 
program information, and New York State 
testing dates.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

Also, every Tuesday for 40 minutes 
(between 2:20 to 3:35) as part of the 
Parent Engagement activities of the 
teachers, informal or formal 
interactions are anticipated as 
scheduled by a respective teacher 
with a particular parent. This year as 
in last year, grade teams or groups 
may be formed to schedule events 
like "Afternoon Tea with the Parents", 
Q and A's about the curriculum, etc. 
during the same day of Parent 
Engagement. Follow up and 
informational calls are made by 
classroom teachers and out-of-
classroom staff (ESL teacher, SETSS, 
and other Related Service providers) 
with parents to schedule one on one 
meetings with them about their 
children.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Documents such as Parents Bill of Rights parent notifications/letters, interpretation notice signs, and other school 
plans, for example the safety plan will be made available in English, Spanish, and other languages that are reflected in 
studentry and parent community.This will be accomplished through the office of parent coordinator who will be 
responsible that such documents and other pertinent information will be explained and interpreted appropriately in 
the language any parent will be able to comprehend. There is a regular meeting that the school building safety plan 
committee holds and the minutes are kept and are available for all the parents and may be translated by the school 
for those who need such service to ensure that these parents in need of language access services are not prevented 
from reaching the school's administrative offices solely due to language barrier. Also during parent-teacher 
conferences, important sign notices are translated in a most prominent language spoken by more than 10% of the 
school population. .  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

During parent-teacher conferences our school will randomly ask parents (those whose home language is other than 
English) about the quality and availability of services being provided to them. We will use parent survey and or short 
questionnaire to address this concern for monitoring and quality control.
