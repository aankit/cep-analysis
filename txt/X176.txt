Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is provide educational experiences to our middle and high school students that are engaging, connected 
to rigorous standards, and meaningful adult-living outcomes. We are building independent learners who can advocate 
for themselves and navigate their environments safely and independently. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
During the summer of 2017-2018, P176X split and was reorganized. P176X used to serve students Pre-K to age 21 and 
now serves only middle and high school students. This allows for a dedicated focus on middle and high school and 
post 21 needs. P. 176X is a District 75 school, serving over 560 students, in 78 classes projected for the 2018-2019 
school year. We are committed to partnerships with families so that we assist each student in achieving maximum 
skill development intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically to ensure maximum independence by graduation. 
We facilitate the transition process for student's aging out of the Department of Education, by working with families 
to establish linkages to a variety of community and government agencies to assist in this process. We are committed 
to alternative pathways to education and are linked with a community schools to provide for our diverse learning 
needs. This includes linkage with the High School of Computers and Technology for students working towards a High 
School Diploma and with District 79's Pathways to Graduation program where three students earned their TASC High 
School Equivalency in 2018. We are linked with a variety of community organizations, as well as businesses, where 
students participate in vocational training. A variety of school based vocational training opportunities and business 
are available to all students to prepare for work in the community. P 176X was involved in with some special 
initiatives, which include various instructional programs where our school piloted a program and then was recognized 
for our efforts. This includes recognition by First Authors writing program (Don Johnson), through the recognition by 
the Anti-Defamation League as a "No Place For Hate" school and recognition by the DOE for our anti-bullying 
program, "Respect for All" school. All 78 classes are on a shared Google system, where data is entered and analyzed 
on an ongoing basis.. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Many of the students are classified with Autism Spectrum Disorder and other special needs, ages 11 – 21. We are 
located in four Community Schools in the Bronx (IS 181, Truman High School, The High School of Computers and 
Technology, and District 79's Pathways to Graduation on Davidson Avenue). Students are grouped in classes according 
to their Individualized Education Plan mandates in ratios of 6:1:1 (42 classes), 8:1:1 (20 classes), 12:1:1 (10 classes) 
and Inclusion (4 classes). Each of the class ratios is indicative of distinctly different learning styles and needs. Due to 
the diverse learning needs of our students, a variety of instructional programs and career development opportunities 
are used to customize the best educational outcomes for each student. 
 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The Framework for Great Schools forms the basis of our program for our special needs students: 

1. Rigorous Instruction: 

Students are grouped according to assessment and curricula selected based on assessment 

 
  At P176X there are a number of programs implemented, by design that are responsive to the diverse 

learning needs of our students. Academic Programs are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) 
and are matched to students’ needs, academic levels and learning styles. These curricula programs include: 
Attainment, Unique, Go Math, Equals, Passport Social Studies, Menu Math, and Access World History. 
IEP Goals and Objectives on are aligned to CCLS, CDOS. 
Instruction is aligned with CCLS, CDOS, and the Danielson Frameworks   
Systematic data collection and analysis of student performance to identify trends and to make timely 
instructional intervention decisions..

  New Teacher Meetings 
  Teacher Trainers: Wilson, SMILE, and Get Ready to Learn 
  Teachers turned key professional development workshops 
  Teacher surveys and other opportunities were available to provide feedback to each other and 

administrators. 

 

3. Strong Family-Community Ties: 

P176X believes parents are critical partners and we look to learn from them about their children and to support 
them with tools and skills 

Inviting parents to attend classroom special projects and activities during a monthly parent academy.  

 
  Behavior support for families 
  Monthly student performances and assemblies 
  Parent Resource Club to address IEP, parent counselling/training

4. Supportive Environment: 

A variety of special programs engage learners with diverse learning needs to include:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

  Other collaborations include, a 4th year initiative at the High School of Computers and Technology where 

seven of our high school students participated in Inclusion. Students are taking courses that can lead to 
computer repair certification. One student gained acceptance to college for 2018. In addition, the school is 
partnering with D79, Pathways to Graduation, where six students will be working on their TASC. Three 
students passed their TASC (High School Equivalency Exam) in 2018. 

  Collaborations with a variety of social service and adult agencies to support parents/guardians and families, 
facilitated by Parent Coordinator, Family Worker. Transition Linkage Coordinator and School Psychologists. 

Inclusive opportunities for students:  

  Physical Education Initiatives: Special Olympics and Rowing

5. Effective School Leadership: 

  Principal and 5 assistant principals meet weekly at minimum. Principal coordinates activities, professional 
development topics with assistant principals. Assistant principals work with teacher instructional coaches 
in each unit to schedule in-classroom support for staff and to hold professional development workshops. 

  Assistant principals hold professional development workshops for staff, and meet with teachers, 

individually, to review student data in various programs, throughout the year. 

  Assistant principals meet with principal to discuss each student's progress based on data/assessments from 

teachers. 

  Teachers and administrators identify students at different levels along a contiuum of skills.  
  Observations are conducted according to schedule and administrators share their observations and 

experiences with each other to learn from one another. 

  Planning calendars are created for teachers and for the administrators so that the entire teaching 

community is aware of when formative, as well as summative assessment is due. 

  Administrators are highly receptive in addressing parents' concerns and schedule a series of meetings with 

parents to monitor the situation after a complaint has been made. The school resources including the 
parent and transition coordinator are utilized to make parent contact following meetings to resolve issues 
that parents might have and to schedule outside and in-school resources that might be available to 
families. 

  We plan to continue these initiatives and established practices during the coming year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year.

School needs assessment was informed by: 

Summative (SANDI/ FAST and Brigance) and Formative Assessments (Program Data) were used to assess student 
progress: 

Analysis of Data Trends:  

SANDI data was collected in the fall 2017 (Sept/Oct) for students in 6:1:1 ratio classes. Students were post tested in 
the spring (May/June). SANDI summary data indicates that student a large amount of student growth when moving 
within and between levels 1 and level 2. A slower rate of growth was indicated within level three and between 
level 2 and level 3 students 

Brigance data was collected in the Fall 2017 (Sept/Oct) for students in 8:1:1 and 12:1:1 ratio classes and then again 
in the spring. Analysis of student progress showed the least amount of growth in listening, reading comprehension, 
and writing. 

Student Formative Assessment for program data (Edmark, SMILE, Attainment, Fountas and PInnell, Go Math, Menu 
Math, and Equals) was reviewed in June: - trends showed the least amount of growth in the areas of reading and 
writing with more students making 5% gains or more using available math programs.

It is essential to provide students with the social and emotional tools so as to build independent learners who can 
advocate for themselves and navigate their environments safely and independently. As a student moves closer to 
age 21, students should be able to function across a variety of settings with independence. A supportive 
environment is provided where fundamental skills will be taught in order to fade supports in a safe and systematic 
way

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

P176X promotes teacher development through a system of collaborative learning and distributive leadership.  

Every teacher receives professional development from their colleagues, both by way of collaborative inquiry teams or 
with the assistance of one or more unit-based mentor teachers (“curriculum coaches”) providing hands-on support to 
each classroom teacher. Coaches model lessons in the classrooms with the teachers both individually and in small 
groups throughout the year. Coaches are either directed by administrators to address specific topics with specific 
teachers as a result of observations, are sought out by teachers, or work with all teachers on a rotating 
basis.  Distributive leadership is evident and fostered through the many leadership roles that teachers in addition to 
the coaches embrace by leading projects throughout the school.  

 All staff members, regardless of experience, are encouraged to attend District 75 workshops, as well as those offered 
from other district within the DOE and beyond. Upon their return, staff members complete a form detailing what they 
learned and how they will use the information gained from the workshop in their teaching practice. This information 
is then vetted by administrators, who utilize the information to further build staff capacity through turn keying and 
teacher pairing. 

Special support is given by coaches to new teachers, who are also partnered with a more experienced teacher at the 
beginning of the year. Together, they address questions relating to classroom environment, classroom management, 
instruction and professional responsibilities. New teachers also meet with the principal to collaborate and reflect on a 
monthly basis. Inter-visitation is done throughout the school year, where new teachers watch more experienced 
teachers. These topics are identified through the observation cycle, etc.  

 

Our mission is provide educational experiences to our middle and high school students that are engaging, connected 
to rigorous standards, and meaningful adult-living outcomes. We are building independent learners who can advocate 
for themselves and navigate their environments safely and independently. Last year, 274 students participated in 23 
work-study programs. Specifically, 185 participated in 10 out-of-school work-sites, and 89 students participated in 13 
in-school work-sites. A small percentage of P176X teachers have a working knowledge of the CDOS standards. 
Additionally, the student vocational assessment needs to be updated to better reflect student voice, interests, and 
skill set and a current connection to the CDOS standards.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

By June 2019, to prepare students in learning skills that will support participation in all facets of an inclusive society, 
teacher-led teams will develop, adapt and implement a comprehensive inventory of student real world and vocational 
skills and student interests in alignment with the Career Development and Occupational Standards (CDOS), as measured 
by the completion of a vocational profile for each student.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Feedback at recent School Leadership Team meetings and Parent Workshops (PTA meeting) has signaled that parents 
want more training and supports for our ELL families, a Health/ Sexual Health curriculum, training on communication 
devices,training on how to support a child as they move towards independence and more volunteer opportunities in 
the school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of P. 176X school-based parent development and empowerment activities and P176X 
volunteer opportunities, parent and alumni participation will increase in trainings and inclusive school events, as 
measured by a 5% increase over the 2017-2018 school year.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 176X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 176X will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The P176X  is a special education school in District 75 that services students with various 
disabilities. The school is comprised of 564 students of these students 70 (12.4%) are English 
Language Learners (ELLs). 
 
Our Supplemental Instructional Program titled "Self Care and Career Readiness" will be a 
literacy based program which will focus on experiential and vocational learning while fostering 
English language acquistion. In addition to exploring skills like resume writing, job interviews, 
and career opportunities,  students will be learning mindfullness and self care techniques.  
 
The program will be held at Truman High School and serve 20 students (one 8:1:1 class and one 
12:1:1 class). The program will run for a total of 15 two hour sessions (from 3:15PM- 5:15PM) 
meeting twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from March through May 2019.  
 
 A P176X administrator (regular work hours 8:00-3:50) will supervise the program and be 
compensated for 1.25 hours per session.  The program will be conducted in English by two 
TESOL Certified teachers. Three Spanish speaking paraprofessionals will support the program 
(one 1:1 paraprofessional as mandated by the IEP of one participating student and two classroom 
paraprofessionals). 
 
 Students will be placed in instructional groups based upon cognitive levels, age and IEP 
mandated ratios.  Instruction will be differentiated.  Research has shown that "differentiation of 
curricular content, the instructional process, and product requirements can effectively 
facilitate student access to, and success within, the general curriculum" (Kronberg, 1999). The 
highly motivating nature of the program along with active participation will allow students to 
make significant gains in the area of  language acquisition and increase communication 
skills.   Common Core Learning Standards, New Language Arts Progressions, and ENL 
methodologies and technology will be infused into all instructional aspects of the program.
Letters of invitation to the program will be sent home to the parents of our ELLs in English and 
the parents' preferred language. The students will be selected on a "first come first served" 
basis.We are purchasing four iPads that will enhance instruction by allowing students to access 
the internet for research, as well as creating assigned projects.

There will be five professional development sessions for the administrative supervisor, teachers, 
and paraprofessionals participating in the Supplemental Instructional Program.  Professional 
Development sessions will be provided by both ENL Teachers and run on Wednesdays from 
March through May 2019 for one hour each session (3:15PM-4:15PM).  
The impact of ongoing professional development has been researched by many professionals. 
The Partnership (2009) was emphatic and stipulated that the environments best suited to teach 
21st century skills "support professional learning communities that enable educators to 
collaborate, share best practices and integrate 21st century skills into classroom practice." 
 
The initial PD session will explore best practices for the instruction of ELLs with disabilites. The 
next three sessions will brainstorm concepts to be presented during the program: 
- job readiness (punctuality, appropriate attire and language, professionalism, etc.) 
- etiquette 
- overall wellness 
- mental health for teenagers 
We will also review chapters of "Scripted Vocational Roleplays" to identify activities to use in 
the program. 
 The final PD session will review the programs effectiveness and suggesstions for future 
programs.

Many parents of our ELL students are not proficient in English and have difficulty securing 
gainful employment. To this end, we are inviting parents to join their children in all instructional 
aspects of the program.  Developing skills alongside their children will allow parents to support 
their children by practicing these skills at home. Letters will be sent home in English and parents' 
preferred languages.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Many students at P 176X were unable to complete the NYSESLAT exam with the following codes on the Exam History Report 
from ATS: “INV”, “OTH”, no code or no entry. This is due to the severity of their disability, autism, as well as co-morbidity 
issues, such as low cognitive ability. Many of these students are non-verbal with limited receptive and expressive language 
skills. All of our entitled ENL students are categorized Alternate Assessment. Two of our students scored level “4”s on the 
NYSAA ELA and thirty scored level “3”s on the NYSAA ELA. Three of our students scored level "4" on the NYSAA Math and 
twenty-eight scored level "3" on the NYSAA Math.  P176X currently uses SANDI, FAST, and Brigance as our primary forms of 
assessment. P176X also uses Fountas and Pinnell, EDMARK, NYC Performance Tasks, Attainment and Unique to assess the 
early literacy skills of ELLs. We plan on including Web ABLLS as well. Data from the various assessments drives instruction for 
our ENL students. This data informs us of which areas (speaking, listening, reading, writing) to focus and plan for the school 
year. After analyzing the data from the assessments, reading and writing are the two areas of which students are in most need 
in ENL.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Formative data is gathered monthly in Google Docs.  Student progress is then re-evaluated on a case by case basis to 
determine the best programs to be used..  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments that are currently in place at P176X include Fountas and Pinnell, NYC Perfomance Tasks, Attainment 
and Unique, pre/post unit tests and data collection from IEP goals. Each classroom uses different summative assessments for 
their student population. We also use writing rubrics made in house to assess student's writing.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data is gathered we use data collected monthly in Google Docs to re-evaluate student progress. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The RTI (Response to Intervention) model at P176X is used to identify and diagnose skill deficits. Strategies are implemented to 
alleviate deficits. The RTI model applies to all students including ELLs who are assessed through standardized assessment or 
alternate assessment.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
P176X students whose home language is not English are given the NYSITELL to determine their eligibility for ENL instruction. 
For the school year 2016-2017, five Kindergarten students and two sixth grade students were administered the NYSITELL, all of 
these students performed at the Entering Level.  All ENL students were assessed with the NYSESLAT during the Spring of 
2016.  The overall NYSESLAT Proficiency Results(*NYSITELL for New Admits) chart shows the majority of P176X students 
remain at the Entering Level over the course of their school years (kindergarten through High School). The results reveal that 
performance levels often do not advance for students with autism.    Despite the disability there have been several advances. 
There are students who have scored Expanding on the NYSESLAT in Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing. At the present 
time, one elementary student, four middle school students and one high school student scored Expanding on the NYSESLAT.   
Picture Symbol Communication and Total Physical Response (TPR) continue to be the methodologies employed with our 
cognitively challenged students. Picture symbols and PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) are used in 
communication instruction. Picture symbols are labeled with the words in the appropriate language (the Native Language 
during Native Language Instruction and English during English as a Second Language Instruction.) Balanced Literacy 
methodology is incorporated for these students, most of whom are on the Pre-Emergent and Emergent Reading Levels. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In order to make adjustments to our programs we collect monthly data in Google Docs and assess on a case by case basis.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

ENL Program: ELLs are served in P176X’s stand alone and integrated  ENL instruction model. The four ENL teachers 
have the following certifications: English to Speakers of Other Languages (K-12). Students are grouped based on their 
age/grade and English proficiency level. 
  
ENL Instruction: ELLs receive the number of units of ENL required by CR Part 154 (ie: 360 minutes per week for 
Entering and Emerging level LEPs, 180 minutes per week for Transitioning and Expanding grades K-8 and 540 minutes 
per week for Entering and Emerging level LEPs, 360 minutes per week for Transtioning and Expanding level LEPs and 
180 minutes per week for advance level LEPs, grades 9-12). To ensure that students meet the standards and pass the 
required state and local assessments, ENL instruction follows the Common Core Learning Standards. The New 
Language Arts Progressions and Home Language Arts Progressions incorporates ENL strategies such as: TotalPhysical 
Response (TPR), Language Experience, Whole Language, graphic organizers and Cooperative Learning. The use of 
technology is incorporated to provide students with additional support throughout instruction. Multisensory 
materials and multicultural ENL materials are infused throughout all aspects of ENL instruction. The classroom library 
includes books of all levels that reflect different backgrounds, needs, and strengths of ELLs. Instruction is 
differentiated through whole group instruction, heterogeneous small group cooperative work and individual 
instruction based upon assessment and IEP goals and objectives.   
    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Currently, 176X does not have a TBE program.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Currently, 176X doesn't have a DL program.    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           ELLs receive the number of units of ENL required by CR Part 154.  For Entering level K-8 ELLs, 360 minutes of ENL is 
provided in total with 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week.  For 
Emerging level K-8 ELLs, 360 minutes of ENL is provided in total with 90 minutes of ENL instruction, 180 minutes of Integrated 
ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/ELA per week. For Transitioning K-8 ELLs, 180 minutes of 
ENL is provided in total with 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or Integrated 
ENL/ELA per week. For Expanding K-8 ELLs, each week 180 minutes of ENL is provided in total and it is solely provided as 
Integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week. For Entering level 9-12 ELLs, each week 540 minutes of ENL is provided in total with 
180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL, 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or Integrated 
ENL/ELA per week. For Emerging level 9-12 ELLs, each week 360 minutes of ENL is provided in total with 90 minutes of Stand 
Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/ELA per 
week.  For Transitioning level 9-12 ELLs, each week 180 minutes of ENL is provided in total with 90 minutes of Integrated 
ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Stand Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/ELA. per week. For Expanding level 9-12 ELLs, each week 
180 minutes of ENL is provided in total and it is provided only in Integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week. P.S.176X does not 
offer Home Language Arts at this time. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   ELL students in ENL and TBE programs receive instructional minutes as per CR Part 154.  
        Content Area Instruction: Content instruction is provided for all ELL students in ENL. All subjects are taught in English 
through ENL methodologies by an ENL teacher with Special Education training. All material is scaffolded for ELLs to learn and 
understand. ENL methodologies include: TPR, Language Experience, the Natural Approach, Whole Language, graphic 
organizers, multi-sensory approaches used in conjunction with augmentative communication devices and use of Mayer 
Johnson picture symbols. Students in alternate placement receive additional support in the native language and English from 
alternate placement paraprofessionals who speak the students’ native languages and  English. Content Area Instruction 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

follows the Common Core Learning Standards for students with severe disabilities (NYSAA). The use of technology is 
incorporated into ENL and content area instruction to give students additional support. Technology is an important resource to 
connect with the ELL population. It can be used through the modalities of Brain Pop, Brain Pop Jr., Brain Pop Espanol, iPad 
apps that promote language learning, Internet based programs that reinforce language arts, mathematics, technology, health, 
science, social studies, art and music are available to all students both in school and at home to facilitate skill development and 
language learning. Multi-sensory and multicultural materials including Intensive English Open Door series, Easy Visual for ENL 
students, writing journals, and ENL Dictionary for Visual Learners are infused throughout all aspects of instruction as per 
School Education Plan for Native Language Arts. The ENL teachers also utilize the SMiLE (Structured Methods in Language 
Education) Program to facilitate language learning and growth.  
  
  
English Language Arts: ENL students at 176X are receiving ENL services and daily additional academic intervention from four 
certified ENL teachers. Our entitled ELLs who are receiving these services need additional support to continue working toward 
their IEP short term and long term goals. They are given all opportunities to acquire the English language skills across all the 
content areas. ENL and classroom teachers use various ENL methodologies to meet students’ individual and specific 
educational needs: TPR (Total Physical Response), LEA (Language Experience Approach), graphic organizers, Mayer Johnson 
symbols, PECS, etc. The use of technology is incorporated to give ENL students additional instructional support: the Smart 
Board interactive system, iPads, software programs (ie: Brain Pop Jr., Tumble Books, Star Fall, Jump Start, PBS KIds). All ELL 
students benefit from targeted AIS (Academic Intervention Services) that our school has set in place to supplement instruction 
provided for the purpose of assisting students in meeting New York State learning standards (NYSAA) and Common Core 
Learning Standards. Additional support is provided using a variety of research based programs such as SMiLE (which helps 
teachers determine students’ reading needs, helps students identify letter sounds and ultimately achieve reading fluency and 
comprehension), Fundations (which provides the research validated strategies that complement every day programs to meet 
standards and serve the needs of our ELL students), and Words Their Way (which provides specific guidance, strategies, and 
tools for helping struggling students catch up with their peers in literacy; specifically utilizing word study with it’s hands-on 
accessible approach to aid students struggling with vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension in middle and secondary 
classrooms).  Teachers also adapt and differentiate curriculum, resources and materials according to students chronological 
age and proficiency levels as well as their scores from the Brigance Diagnostic, SANDI, FAST, NYSESLAT and NYSAA. As well as 
using teacher made materials to supplement curriculum that aligns with the Common Core Learning Standards for New York 
State. Each student’s IEP goals are incorporated into meaningful instruction.   
  
Balanced Literacy: The use of software and multimedia enhances and supports the development of English Literacy. Word 
walls, guided readings, and shared readings are all used in the ENL classrooms to enhance vocabulary, comprehension and 
English fluency. Curriculum and the CCLS (Common Core Learning Standards) are accessed through Whole Language Approach, 
Language Experience, multi-sensory approaches, cooperative learning, and infusion of arts into education and the use of 
technology. The classroom library consists of books in English, with native language versions available to ENL students, 
including books adapted by teachers to meet the diverse needs of our population of students with severe disabilities.  
  
Math: Math instruction for ELLs follows the Common Core Learning Standards and utilizes a variety of Math programs: Equals, 
Envisions, Go Math, Attack Math. Students are matched to a math program based upon assessment. A hands on, multi-sensory 
approach, learning through doing and using a manipulative approach. Technology is a key practice in math education and 
when possible the Smart Board is utilized for instruction. Math is instructed through the district curriculum based on the 
Common Core Standards as well as best practices instruction.  
  
  
Science: Science instruction for ELLs follows the Common Core Learning Standards and utilizes the following science programs: 
Playtime as Science, Foss Science, and functional science based Activities for Daily Living (ie: identifying weather conditions to 
know how to dress, identifying temperatures for cooking, etc.) Science is instructed through the district curriculum based on

program, Meville to Weville, along with News2You and Weekly Reader for current events are the programs that are utilized for 
instruction. Social Studies is also instructed through the district curriculum(based on the Common Core Standards).  
    
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Students are also assessed with Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI) and the Formative Assessment of 
Standards Task (FAST). Students are also assessed through teacher observations.  Assessments are conducted in both English 
and the students' native language.  ELLs are evaluated through their native language with help from bilingual teachers and 
paraprofessionals who can help translate for our ENL students.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

        Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE): At the present time P176X does not have any SIFE students. If any SIFE 
students attend P176X,  they will receive the following services: Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in small groups and/or on 
a 1:1 basis, depending on individual needs.  Once a SIFE student is performing at or above the transitioning/intermediate level 
on the annual English language proficiency assessment, the student's status as a student with Inconsistent/Interrupted Formal 
Education is removed and the student will remain as ELL and will receive ENL instruction. 
  
Service Provided to Newcomers (0-3):  
The IEPs of newcomer ENL student are reviewed, appropriate placements are made and related and support services are 
provided. Office Staff complete students intake packages including Home Language Identification Survey. The NYCDOE and P.S. 
176X Parent Handbooks are given to parent/guardians in their native languages. Parent/Guardians are encouraged to attend 
monthly PTA and family involvement activities where translation is provided by Bilingual staff and family support worker. All 
notices sent home are translated utilizing Translation Funding in Galaxy. The parent coordinator and the family support worker 
are available to assist parents. Teachers correspond with families/guardians on an on-going basis concerning student 
adjustment to school.  
  
Services provided to these newcomers, as well as those who may receive ENL service in the future, may include, but are not 
limited to, AIS, Title III, CHAMPS, Project Arts, Ramapo for Children and Best Buddies, and Super Star Afterschool program.  
  
Students Who Have Received an Extension of Services (4-6 years):  
Currently there are 42 entitled ELLs who have received ENL service from P176X for 4-6 years.  These students have access to 
the following services: Students will participate in Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in small groups or on a 1:1 basis 
depending on their individual needs.  
  
ENL services will continue as per the student’s IEP and in accordance with their proficiency levels as determined by their score 
on the NYSESLAT.  
  
        Plan for Long-Term ELLs:  
       
Long term ENL students are served according to their IEP mandates and their proficiency level determined by the 
NYSESLAT.The instructional needs of students who require an alternate placement paraprofessional are met as per their 
IEP recommendation. On-going instructional intervention is scheduled to help students achieve to their highest potential and 
improve their language proficiency. Interventions include; ability grouping, 1:1 tutoring, and the use of other specialized 
materials. Assessment is obtained through  SANDI, FAST, NYSESLAT and informal teacher observation. This data is necessary in 
designing meaningful lessons that meet specific needs.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

  
Former ELLs: 
Former ELLs who exited from ELL status are receiving one half of one unit(90 minutes per week) of study of English as a new 
language and they are eligible for certain testing accommodations.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
P.S. 176X ENL teachers use instructional strategies and adapted grade-level materials that provide both access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English Language development. All subject areas are taught in English through ENL 
methodologies by the ENL teachers with Special Education training. The ENL methodologies used include: TPR, Language 
Experience, the Natural Approach, Whole Language, the use of graphic organizers, mufti-sensory approaches used in 
conjunction with augmentative communication devices, and picture symbols. Students in Alternate Placement receive 
additional support in the native language and English from a paraprofessional who speaks the students’ native language and 
English. Content Area Instruction follows the Common Core Learning Standards for students.  The use of technology is 
seamlessly incorporated into ENL and content area instruction to aid and support students in their learning. Brain Pop ,  Brain 
Pop ENL, Tumble books, Internet based programs that reinforce content area subjects (language arts, mathematics, 
technology, health, science, social studies, music and art) are available to all students throughout instruction. Parents are 
encouraged to use these programs as a resource and home support. Multisensory and multicultural materials including 
intensive English Open Door series, Easy Visual for ENL students, writing journal entries and ENL Dictionary for Visual 
Learners are infused throughout all aspects of instruction as per the School Education Plan for Native Language Arts.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
P176X works together to develop curriculum that aligns to the common core standards for our English Language Learner 
Students with Disabilities. We use data gathered from the SANDI assessment and the FAST to determine instruction as well as 
IEP goals. ENL teachers work in conjunction with classroom teachers to help ELL students progress in their IEP goals. At the 
onset of the school year classroom teachers, ENL teachers, and related service professionals work collaboratively to create a 
flexible schedule that is beneficial for the ELL students. As often as possible ENL teachers co-teach in the classrooms to keep 
students in their least restrictive environment and make instruction as meaningful as possible for all ELL students.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ENL content area instruction is provided as follows: all subject areas are taught in English through ENL methodologies by ENL 
teachers with Special Education training. Targeted interventions for ELA include; research based programs such as Fundations 
(which provides research validated strategies that complement every day programs to serve the needs of our ELLs), Words 
Their Way (which provides specific guidance, strategies, and tools for helping struggling students catch up with their peers), 
EDMARK (which is developed for students with learning and/or developmental disabilities and for those who have not 
succeeded in other reading methods). District 75 Curriculum Maps (which align content area topics to the common core 
standards for students with disabilities), along with the Unique Learning System (developed for students with special needs to 
acccess the general curriculum)are used as  interventions for ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies.   
Language literacy materials used in the bilingual classes include Scott ForsemanK: Carteles de rimas y canciones; McGraw Hill: 
Lectura1st, Dias y dias de Poesias and the Department of Education classroom library.The use of bilingual software and 
multimedia enhances and supports the development of native language skills. 
ENL and classroom teachers use ENL methodologies to meet students individual and specific educational needs. The LEA 
(Language Experience Approach), graphic organizers, communication devices, and picture symbols are used to support 
instruction.   
The use of technology is constantly incorporated to aid students in their learning. The SMART board interactive system, iPads, 
and software programs (ie: Jump Start, Brain Pop,) are used.   
All ENL students benefit from targeted AIS (Academic Intervention Services) that our school has set in place to supplement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

instruction to assist students in meeting the Common Core Learning Standards.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

At this time, we do not have any new programs planned for the upcoming school  year for ELLs.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have any programs we are discontinuing for ELLs.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school offerings just as their monolingual peers. Our supplemental programs such as 
Get  Ready to Learn are available to all our students. ELL students are also afforded the opportunity to join our Title III program 
and all other programs each year. Each of P 176X’s sites has an assistant principal and a curriculum support teacher, both with 
expertise in effective instructional practices for students with autism, who provide support to all students including LEP 
students.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
As stated previously, ELLs at 176X are supported through the use of software and multimedia, which further enhances and 
supports the development of English literacy. Activities are extended throughout the curriculum and subject areas by 
combining the interdisciplinary/thematic approach with Language Experience, Whole Language, multi-sensory, cooperative 
learning, the infusion of the arts, and the use of technology. To comply with the New York City’s Literacy requirements each 
classroom library contains books in the native language, including those adapted by teachers to meet the needs of students 
with severe disabilities.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 In ENL classroom, native language is supported by the alternate placement paraprofessional assigned to the student. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All support and services provided to ELLs at 176X appropriately correspond to the ages and grade levels of the entitled ELL 
students. Materials are adapted to pertain to the particular ELL’s learning disability. Every effort is made to ensure that al 
materials are appropriate for the child’s chronological age and ability.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
As stated previously, ELLs at P176X are supported through the use of software and multimedia, which further enhances and 
supports the development of English literacy. Activities are extended throughout the curriculum and subject areas by 
combining the interdisciplinary/thematic approach with Language Experience, Whole Language, multisensory, cooperative 
learning, the infusion of the arts, and the use of technology. To comply with the New York City’s Literacy requirements each 
classroom library contains books in the native language, including those adapted by teachers to meet the needs of students 
with severe disabilities. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
P176X follows a 12 month school year.  When a new ELL is enrolled and it is obvious that extra support services are required 
for the student and/or the family the Parent Coordinator, Bilingual Family Worker, and Counselors  get involved as need be.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

P176X does not offer language electives. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

At this time our school does not have a Dual Language program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
During the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years, P176X’s individual sites held weekly professional development meetings for all 
staff members. During these meetings meaningful educational practices are discussed pertaining to ELLs and all students. 
Some topics during professional development sessions include Strategies and Materials for Native Language Arts instruction, 
best practices in ENL education, accessing the Common Core Learning standards, NYSAA extensions and assessment of ELLs.  In 
addition to this professional development, all pedagogues  are required by NY  State to complete Jose P. training.   Teachers of 
ELLs have the opportunity to attend Professional Development workshops about how to incorporate the Common Core 
Learning Standards through ENL modalities for Special Needs students. These PDs are offered by the District 75 ELL Office 
throughout the year and pertain to various academic topics.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
3. All staff at P176X (teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, speech 
therapists, secretaries, family worker, and parent coordinator) who serve ELL students will also be supported through coaching 
services provided by the school’s instructional coach and curriculum support teachers, which also focus on topics such as 
transitioning from elementary to middle and/or middle to high school. In addition, P176X encourages the aforementioned staff 
to attend district, city, and state wide conferences focusing on the education of ELLs. Furthermore, all teachers serving ELLs 
have a common professional development period. They meet in cohorts of 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1 classes. One meeting a week is 
with the Assistant Principal to discuss curriculum. There is a weekly meeting with the behavior support teacher to address 
behavioral issues. The ENL teachers are available to meet weekly to support the teachers with ELL instructional support. 
Paraprofessionals providing support to students transitioning from ENL classrooms meet with the ENL teacher weekly to 
discuss and reinforce instructional strategies used with the ELLs.  
All classroom and content area teachers will receive the 15%  of their required professional development hours by attending 
workshops, which will include education of ENL strategies and materials, technology, and content areas. All classroom teachers 
and content area teachers are offered support from the Jose P. ENL Training to help them provide more support to ELL 
students. The school payroll secretary keeps a list of teachers who attended the Jose P. training and the certificates are kept on 
file. This training is offered by the District 75 Office of ELLs throughout the year. For all bilingual and ENL teachers  50% of their 
required professional development hours is dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
language learners.  Agendas of all professional development periods and attendance records are kept on file in the Principal's 
office

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P176X individually meets with the parents/guardians of ELLs once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial 
parent orientations and IEP meetings, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their 
child's English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This meeting is 
conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent/guardian best 
understands.`     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent orientation sessions for newly enrolled students take place in the spring, prior to enrollment, and in the fall, and are 
open to all parents, including parents of newly enrolled ELL students. Various educational topics are discussed, materials are 
distributed to parents, and instruction is provided to allows parents to apply the materials received and the skills acquired in 
their home setting. Topics scaffold one upon the next in order to provide building blocks for parents to assist their child to 
access, acquire, and utilize the life skills required to foster independence. P176X also offers parents of ELLs this information in 
the home’s dominant language. Parents are linked to private agencies to provide support as needed by the Parent Coordinator 
and the bilingual Family Worker.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alexandra Guerriero, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P176X determines our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs to ensure that all parents are 
provided with appropriete and timely information in a language they can understand. Data is gathered when 
parents complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), for all first time entrants to P176X and the New 
York City Public School System. Every September the Student Emergency Contact cards are sent home. These 
cards request parents/guardians to indicate their preferred language for both written and oral communication. 
We also survey our teachers, the parent coordinator and family worker(bilingual) to identify parents of students 
who are non-English speaking. We also use ATS reports(RPOB and RHLA) to assess language preference of the 
parents. We continuously review the students in the bilingual class and those receiving ESL services for translation 
and interpretation needs.
