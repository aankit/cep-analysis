Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of The Brooklyn Latin School is to provide a specialized, classical education, including the study of Latin 
and Greek, in a disciplined academic environment. It provides the groundwork for an understanding of the foundation 
of our society, while developing the leadership capacity of our students so that they may serve as leaders in their 
communities. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Brooklyn Latin School is a specialized high school.  

 

The school’s CEP goals are: preparing students to earn the IB Diploma and preparing students to be college ready. 

 

Here is the contextual information about our school’s unique rigorous instruction. 

 

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme influences everything we do at Brooklyn Latin, including our 
philosophy, our instructional curriculum, and how we allocate our budget. Because equity, access, and opportunity 
are so important, all students of our students are enrolled in the IB Programme and all take six IB courses in their 
junior and senior year. Since the IB courses are all college level courses, we are preparing our students for college 
instruction. We pay for all costs associate with IB from our budget.  

Since it was founded in 1968, the IB’s mission has been built on a cornerstone of creating a better world through 
education. However, for many decades, only children of the elite and politically connected were able to experience 
the program due to the costs. The IB Programme is still regarded as an elite program due to its expensive cost but at 
TBLS, we use it to drive equity and disrupt inequities in our society and in the NYC school system.  

The IB requirements exceed those of New York City and New York State and they serve as the bar by which we 
measure our progress. In 2011, thirty-three percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. In 2012, thirty-seven 
percent of our graduates earned an IB Diploma. In 2013, forty percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. In 2014, 
forty-nine percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. We hope to maintain these percentages and are looking at 
better structures that we can create to support more students to earn the IB Diploma. Students that do not earn the 
IB Diploma go on to earn individual certificates in the IB courses. In 2015, sixty-eight percent of our students earned 
an IB Diploma. In 2016, seventy-three percent of our students earned an IB diploma. In 2017, forty-eight percent of 
our students earned an IB Diploma. In 2018, fifty one percent of our students earned an IB Diploma.  

Colleges grant college credits that can be used towards fulfilling graduation requirements to students that have 
earned the IB Diploma. Colleges may grant college credits that can be used towards fulfilling graduation requirements 
to students that have earned IB certificates. 

One hundred percent of our seniors are accepted into college and last year our graduating class matriculated to 
college at a rate of 99%. Most of our graduates are currently enrolled full time in a four- year college (95%) and (4%) 
of our recent graduates are enrolled in a two year college. 

 

Our students also show college readiness through performance based assessments including school-wide Internal 
Assessments (100% graduation rate) and Regents examinations (96% completion rate). In addition, our students are 
evaluated by nationally recognized college admissions examinations including the college achievement exam (ACT) 
and college aptitude exam (SAT). Our students historically perform at a rate higher than the state and national 
average on the SAT examination. Although a large portion of our student body come from historically 
underrepresented and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, (close to 60% currently receive free/reduced lunch) 
our students are attending college at a rate higher than the national, state, and city average which is 51%. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Many of our students are first in family, or first generation college-going students who benefit from a comprehensive 
approach to college preparation. College counselors help support every student and their family through the ever-
changing college admissions process. All of our juniors participate in the annual Unique High School College Fair and 
are encouraged to attend our school’s annual college night. The Brooklyn Latin School also hosts an annual financial 
aid night to provide financial education and support to students and their families. Individual college meetings are 
offered to all students and families in junior and senior years and college counselors provide in-class instruction based 
on college-specific milestones for all four years. 

Here is the contextual information about our school’s collaborative teacher. 

All teachers are members of collaborative teacher teams. All teachers are Department Teams, in addition, some 
teachers are members of the New Magistri (Teacher) Team , Department Chair Team, Counseling Team, Advisory 
Team, Office Team, etc. 

 

Collaboration is at the core of our discipuli instruction and magistri culture.  

 

For 2018-2019, we have been granted two amazing opportunities to work with instructional technology consultants 
through Google Dynamic Learning Project (DLP) and Educate.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Brooklyn Latin School is one of the most diverse schools in the DOE. Discipuli identify with these demographics: 

 

~52% Asian 

~11% Hispanic 

~13% Black 

~14% White 

~4% Multi-Racial 

 

And demographics as of July 2018 for the incoming class IV are as follows: 

~51% Asian  

~10% Hispanic 

~13% Black 

~11% White 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

Our students needs are both academic and scholarly, and social and emotional. The IB Programme is very rigorous 
and challenging and our students need the academic support and structures to be successful as well as the social and 
emotional tools to balance this curriculum.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress and our focus is rigorous 
instruction and collaborative teachers. Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and 
aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
While IB is definitely at the core of everything at TBLS, sustaining the costs associate with IB is a major priority need. 

 

Strength - IB Programme. 

The IB requirements exceed those of New York City and New York State and they serve as the bar by which we 
measure our progress. In 2011, thirty-three percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. In 2012, thirty-seven 
percent of our graduates earned an IB Diploma. In 2013, forty percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. In 2014, 
forty-nine percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. In 2015, sixty-eight percent of our students earned an IB 
Diploma. In 2016, seventy-three percent of our students earned an IB diploma. In 2017, forty-eight percent of our 
students earned an IB Diploma. In 2018, fifty-one percent of our students earned an IB Diploma. We hope to maintain 
these percentages and are looking at better structures that we can create to support more students to earn the IB 
Diploma. We are also creating better messaging for our community so more see the Certificates as a successful route 
and not a failed route. Students that do not earn the IB Diploma go on to earn individual certificates in the IB courses. 

 

We will do deep dive of the data including enquiry upon results and use this to make changes to our instruction and 
support of the Core, Creativity Activity Service (CAS) and Extended Essay (EE).  

 

Sustaining the costs for IB for All of our students is not sustainable. This is a major priority.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By August 1, 2019, we want to maintain the statistics that 50 percent of our Diploma candidates will earn an IB Diploma. 
We also will continue to incorporating feedback from our 5 year review around the areas of resources (budget, 
mandatory teacher training, facilities), horizontal and vertical alignment, alignment and support of the Core. We were 
disappointed to learn IB could not be included in the Central funding for AP for All, and also disappointed to learn 
Central did not receive the ESSA grant that we helped write for Title IV funding. According to IB, all other IB schools in 
New York State use Title IV funding to pay for all and any IB costs such as registration, exams, teacher training, books, 
test banks, mark schemes, enquiry upon results, etc. However, Central chose to use Title IV funding for things other than 
IB.  

 

Last year we formed a coalition with other IB schools in New York State and we were able to join forces to lobby for the 
reinstatement of fee waivers for Title 1 students.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

We have designed our curriculum so that each of our students is 
taking fourteen college level International Baccalaureate 
Programme classes before they graduate. We have planned the 
9-12 curriculum back from end of course International 
Baccalaureate Assessments, scaffolding the curriculum from 
ninth grade through twelfth grade ensuring that our students are 
ready for International Baccalaureate assessments and college 
level work.

schools to learn how to best support the Core. In addition, we 
will participate in IB GIBS Roundtables.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
We will describe our rigorous IB curriculum to parents at Open Houses, DLCs, PA meetings, and Parent meetings. We 
always have dedicated parent meetings for IB choices and a dedicated IB PA meeting. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
We have developed and implemented a two year college preparation course that will guide our students through the 
college process from determining the criteria for a college or university through the transition from high school to 
college. 

 

The school counselors and assistant head masters have used check point meetings to identify students who may be 
off track for graduation, to monitor students who may be off track for an IB Diploma, to check in on and support 
students who are struggling, to discuss best practices for teachers in supporting students, and to celebrate student 
successes. 

We spend over 200K of tax levy money to pay for IB fees, IB student testing fees, programs such as IB’s Managebac 
and Turnitin, to support students in the completion of their IB requirements, and IB professional development for 
teachers and staff. All of this money comes from tax levy allocations. During 2017-2018, our magistri engaged in 
online training. While this met compliance for IB, it is not ideal for teaching and learning but we will continue to 
explore this option in 2018-2019 since it is cost effective. We will see funding from Central to continue to meet our IB 
training needs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strength - advisory program for all discipuli which creates a supportive environment 

 

Data from school counselors, student surveys, and annecdotes show students need more SEL supports. Data from 
Ramapo also supports this need.  

We have an advisory program that meets once a week. All discipuli participate in advisory and all teachers are 
advisors. Advisors and advisory stay together for all four years. Advisory offers another level of social, emotional, 
learning (SEL) support for our discipuli, as well as provides a space for celebration, team building and school spirit. For 
2018-2019, we want to incorporate lessons from The Door, RULER, and other SEL supports to improve our advisory 
program. For 2018-2019, we also introduced homeroom for the first time since our founding! This will be another 
structure to support SEL.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Over the past few years, we have implemented changes to the structure of our advisory system to be single grade 
advisories, to eliminate whole class assemblies, to limit room changes, and to add new topics such as time 
management skills, academic integrity, sexual harassment and bullying, digital citizenship, as well as bonding and 
cultural activities to improve school culture. We have also aligned the advisory program to the IB learner profile 
attributes. Although Advisory is not perfect, it is a work in progress. During 2017-2018, we used lessons from The 
Door. For 2018-2019, we want to enhance this with RULER efforts and support. We look forward to learning how the 
equity work and SEL work may be combined through Advisory and are curious to learn more about Title IV funding.

implementation and oversight. 
We will dedicate time for parent outreach phone calls and make the following enhancements:  

- Coordinating outreach with PID support by asking magistri to reach out to specific students and tack on a PID 
message to their class update 

- Providing sample scripts to support magistri in comfort with phone calls 

- Promoting norm of logging outreach in Skedula 

- Pushing to update contact info in Skedula / ATS so it is accurate, and having a protocol in place to update ATS when 
we get more reliable phone numbers for parents that all staff is aware of

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength- Collaborative Teacher Teams. Collaboration is at the core of our discipuli instruction and magistri culture. 
Anecdotal data shows collaboration is very helpful and important for our community. 

 

All teachers are members of at least one collaborative teacher teams. All teachers members of Department Teams, in 
addition, some teachers are members of the New Magistri (Teacher) Team , Department Chair Team, Counseling 
Team, Advisory Team, Office Team, etc.  

 

In department teams, teachers meet twice a week to plan curriculum development, share best practices, look at 
student work, create and norm rubrics, set department goals, share feedback from inter-visitations, etc. After each 
interim assessment cycle to reflect on student performance, and discuss plans for adjusting instruction accordingly. 
Each department member completes an interim assessment data analysis template that asks teachers to identify 
major trends as well as focus in on students of concern. Each team member shares their follow up plan. In 
department teams, teachers also look at student work from each grade level to inform changes to their instructional 
program, and to address alignment issues between the courses. At the end of the year, IB performance data informs 
department work. Departments adjust curriculum and skill instruction to respond to IB data trends, and to improve 
students overall performance on the IB. 

 

 

In counseling teams, school counselors meet weekly to discuss specific students’ social, emotional, and academic 
progress. They use anecdotes and observations, as well as data from Interim Assessments and Term Reports, and IEPs 
(where applicable) to support our students. They meet with our special education coordinator to create 
accommodations to support to our students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

 

Teachers co-plan with each other at every level of every subjects, and teachers work together to make nearly every 
curriculum, instruction and student support decision. Our goal is to create grade-wide assessment calendars, to provide 
students with a fairer, more balanced schedule, and the opportunity to better manage their time, participate in 
activities outside of school and maintain academic, social, emotional and physical balance and health.  

 

By the first semester, we want to introduce a Sunshine Club 2018-2019 (Comitas), and continue our work with 
SWELLness and the comfort dogs, that can celebrate our community (magisri included) and help them attain more 
balance, SEL and good mental health as well.  

By January 2019, Departments and Grade Level Teams will work together to create a public (visible to teachers, students 
and parents) assessment calendar via the school’s website/Pupil Path that includes 100% of major assessments such as 
exams and long-term essays. This has been an area of conflict for our staff and we are making positive strides to make 
this public.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The Department Chair will meet regularly with the AHM of 
Teaching and learning to set goals and offer support and 
coaching. Together, they will create a schedule for inter-
visitations, coaching visits, co-planning visits, etc.  

Departments will work together to create a public (visible to 
teachers, students and parents) assessment calendar via the 
school’s website or Pupil Path that includes 100% of major 
assessments such as exams and long-term essays.  

 

The Counseling Chair will meet regularly with the Head Master to 
set goals and offer support 

Learning Partners Program will continue for a second year and 
meet monthly around a problem of practice -student 
engagement. We have been partnered with Brooklyn Technical 
HS and Brooklyn Preparatory HS. We will also be looking at data 
through an Equity Rigor lens.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
We make schedule adjustments to allow for departments and grade level leaders to meet in the day, as well as visit 
each other’s classes. Teacher leaders teach one fewer class than teachers. This has a huge impact on the budget and

Strength - leadership- many opportunities for distributed leadership and collaborative decision making. Two great 
opportunities this year to work with Google through Dynamic Leadership Project (DLP) and Educate to support 
teachers to use technology to make a positive impact on student achievement.  

There are many structures to support distributed leadership at Brooklyn Latin. There are many team meetings where 
these key stakeholders have a forum to provide ideas and concerns about strengths and priorities.  

 

- Assistant Head Master of Teaching and Learning who supports teachers 

- Assistant Head Master of Student Life who supports students 

- Assistant Head Master of Teaching and Learning who supports teachers 

- Assistant Head Master of Operations who supports systems and logisitics 

- IB Coordinator who supports IB teachers and students 

- Department Chairs (teacher leaders) that coach teachers 

Priority and major growth is Fundraising for IB, creating sustainable systems such as programming. We attended a 
grant writing workshop, signed up for PD/PL, sent and letter campaign, and applied for grants. Paying for IB for All is 
not sustainable with our budget and we need help! 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By September 2018 every teacher will be part of a department team. Early September, we will roll out a new plan for 
our weekly all staff meetings that will include whole staff meetings, parent engagement, PD, and committees. By

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
All teacher leaders have a lighter teaching schedule. This affects the number of teachers we hire and we also make 
schedule adjustments to allow departments to have common prep periods through the day to meet, collaborate, and 
visit classes. This may prove to be impossible and not sustainable in the future. We had to excess 2 positions and did 
not hire 4 positions in June 2018. Our budget is not sustainable.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Brooklyn Latin School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Brooklyn Latin School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The Brooklyn Latin School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, our school uses teacher-created formal and informal assessments (such as written 
assignments or text-based comprehension exercises). These assessments vary by subject and by teacher. Teachers individually 
evaluate the data from these assessments and share results and performance trends of ELL students with the ESL teacher, 
Caitlin Ferraro. These data provide insights about ELL students' literacy as well as their proficiency in all 4 modalities across 
content areas, and based on these data the ESL teacher works with other subjects teachers to create and/or modify 
instructional plans for individual ELL students.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Instruction is delivered in pull-out /heterogenous model.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Academic success is evaluated through the NYSESLAT and Regents scores. We also evaluate success based on how the ELL has 
developed socially and emotionally. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Instruction is delivered in pull-out /heterogenous model.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Due to our school's small ELL population, the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data is limited and does not allow for much analysis of 
trends or patterns in performance. However, data patterns across the years have revealed that the majority of students enter 
our school with a Commanding level of English proficiency. Additionally, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data shows that each year 
students are significantly increasing proficiency level and have met grade level proficiency in English Regents.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Instruction is delivered in pull-out /heterogenous model.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program.

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The mandated number of minutes are provided to each student according to his/her proficiency level.  Beginning level 
students receive 540 minutes of ESL instruction per week, Intermediate students receive 360 minutes of ESL per week, and 
Advanced students receive 180 minutes of ESL weekly. These mandated instructional minutes tke place during ELL students' 
study hall and/or lunch periods, as well as during their non-credit-bearing classes, when necessary.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

   Core content areas are provided to these students using an ESL approach. The materials and methods used, including 
structures such as graphic organizers, pictures, maps, modified text, realia, dictionaries and glossaries, as well as methods 
including sheltered English instruction, are used to provide support across content areas. In sessions of pull-out services, the 
ESL teacher scaffolds content-area material and uses ELL students' coursework to tailor instruction and foster English language 
proficiency development.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   When/If an evaluation is deemed necessary, students are evaluated in the language in which they feel most comfortable  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. If students with interrupted formal education are admitted into this school, they will be assessed to find the strengths in 
their educational experiences and an individual instructional plan will be established for them.  The guidance counselor / social 
worker will work closely with these students to assure their success in the school environment. 
  
b.Plan for newcomers 
Newcomers will be provided with ESL methodology and support particularly in the content areas as well as survival skills. 
c.     ELLs receiving 4 -6 years of services 
For ELLs in this category, a study of their NYSESLAT will determine the modalities where their needs are greatest and a plan 
will be executed to help them develop the skills needed to achieve at the proficiency level of the NYSESLAT. 
d.     Long Term ELLs 
ELLs who have exceeded six years of services must be provided with additional supports in the modalities where they show a 
lack of progress.  A study of their vocabulary and writing skills is necessary to build on their prior knowledge. 
           
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
A careful review of the IEP for ELL-SWD is necessary in order to assure that correct language instruction is being 
provided.  Appropriate materials must be used in accordance to their educational plan.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs with special needs are provided with support in the least restrictive environment according to their IEPs.  This may mean 
that the students are mainstreamed for certain content areas and provided with a more restrictive environment or other 
content areas depending on the IEP. The ESL teacher, assistant principal for teaching and learning, and special education 
teacher frequently communicate and support teachers who have English Language Learners in their classroom to assure ELL-
SWDs can achieve their goals.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students that have achieved at the proficiency level in the NYSESLAT continue to receive accommodations as required by the 
NYSED for up to two years.  These supports include: ESL support classes, extended time in all Regents Exams, availability of 
regents in the student’s native language / translations, additional reading of test instructions, use of glossaries.  Targeted 
intervention programs are only available in English; however, Regents and International Baccalaureate exams are available in 
the student's native language. Reading web-supplemental programs and math programs are also made available to students in 
English and their native language when identified by ESL teacher or content teacher that students needs supplemental 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

support. ESL teacher works with content teachers to identify needed early intervention and provide services. When needed, 
targeted interventions are provided for math, social studies, and other content areas in the form of individual or small-group 
instruction during teachers' office hours. We will use data from the math and social studies Regents exams to identify the 
specific ELL subgroups to target with such interventions.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

ESL teachers will continue to attend professional development and in turn provide more professional development to 
classroom teachers on differentiation strategies for ELLS in their classroom.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None will be discontinued.     
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our school offers over 40 co-curricular and extracurricular programs, including (but not limited to): PSAL sports, arts clubs 
(drama, a cappella, studio art), the Latineer (student newspaper), student senate, and Certamen (Latin club). ELLs are not 
excluded from participation in any extracurricular programs. Also, supplemental services such as office hours, group study 
hours, tutoring services, and mentoring partnerships are offered to ELLs in the building by the ESL teacher and all of the ELL's 
content teachers; these services are offered Monday through Thursday.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials (including technology) used to support ELLs includes ESL textbooks/computer programs to support 
writing, learner dictionaries, multimedia resources, speaking and listening resources, test prep resources, and various 
materials used in core content classrooms.      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is provided through the use of native language materials, dual language dictionaries and glossaries.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services and resources support correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  The ESL teacher scaffolds grade 
appropriate material in pull-out sessions and uses ELL students coursework to tailor instruction   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The instructional materials (including technology) used to support ELLs includes ESL textbooks/computer programs to support 
writing, learner dictionaries, multimedia resources, speaking and listening resources, test prep resources, and various 
materials used in core content classrooms.      
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
ELL students are included in all of our new student orientation activities in August where they will be introduced to some 
content teachers and counselors.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Latin and Spanish.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All personnel who teach ELLs are provided with strategies to incorporate in their instruction of ELLs. Caitlin Ferraro, ESL 
coordinator/Spanish teacher and Carol Ann Van Deventer, ESL/Spanish teacher, participate in trainings for LAP, NYSESLAT, and 
AMAO tool training.  The ESL coordinator also attends local workshops on ELL strategies to inform teaching and offer turnkey 
strategies to all staff.  The professional development plan also includes one department meeting per month dedicated for ELL 
personnel, who in turn also provide updates and discuss strategies at weekly faculty meeting and grade-level team meetings. 
ESL/language teachers will also meet with content teachers to plan and strategize ELL instruction as needed.   
The professional development offered to ELL teachers includes attending workshops on Common Core Learning Standards, 
online coursework to further their understanding, and NYSITELL/NYSESLAT training.  
    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All ELLs participate in new student orientation in August. Students may also attend a 3 day orientation trip to Princeton 
Blairstown to build social & emotional skills and feel comfortable amongst their new classmates and teachers. Students are 
also placed in an advisory when entering high school.  The advisor is an advocate for students and is responsible for helping 
student achieve not only academically, but also transition socially/emotionally.  ELLs also meet guidance counselors in the 
beginning of the year.  Through these acitivites, staff is given the opportunity to work closesly with ELLs to ensure they are 
having a smooth transition. The ESL coordinator gives PD each school year on common social/emotional/acadmeic struggles of 
ELLs and how to identify these struggles and give support through strategies. 
  
The school will conduct a survey of staff to determine who is in need of 7.5 hours of ELL training as per Jose P. Teachers 
will  participate in intervisitations of two 45 minute class sessions to view an ESL teacher conducting an ESL lesson as part of 
the 7.5 hours of ELL training required. Additional ways to achieve the 7.5 hours will include UFT training sessions, on-line 
course work, and meetings with ESL coordinator. The Director of Teaching and Learning will keep records of professional 
development activities by filing agendas and attendance records for the year, and all professional development /meeting 
agendas will be made available on Google Drive for all faculty to access and reference.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ELL parents are regularly in contact via phone or email with content teachers, ESL teachers, Grade Level Leaders, advisors, the 
parent coordinator, and counselors (if necessary) on a regular basis (with preferred language translation/interpretation

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gina Mautschke, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Lanugage preferences of the parent community are assessed through data collected from Student Emergency 
Contact cards ("blue cards"), ATS reports, and the Home Language Identification Survey, as well as parent 
information collected through surveys administered by various teachers. 

All students at Brooklyn Latin complete the blue emergency card forms which require parents to inform the 
school of their language preferences and any translation needs. The Home Language Idenfitication Survey is 
administered to all parents of newly enrolled students in the NYC public school system, and in addition these 
students and their families have an informal interview with the school to ensure that the school is aware of all 
translation and interpretation needs.  

The parent coordinator works with teachers, the DOE, and outside contractors to ensure all parents' translation 
needs are met, and will also consider creating a report with parents' preferred languages, to be shared with 
school staff.

English, Mandarin, Spanish and Bengali 
are the preferred languages for written 
and oral communication. Mandarin and 
Spanish translation and interpretation 
are in highest need. Parents have the 
opportunity to express these preferred 
languages and translation needs in a 
meeting and orientation for new families 
at the beginning of each school year.            

 

   

 

 

 

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Welcome Poster will be posted in a highly visible location in the front entrance lobby of the school building. 

Parents will be notified of Parents' Bill of Rights accessibility via the NYC DOE website. 

Parents' Guides to Language Access are available to parents at the beginning of the year. 

Language ID Guides are accessible in the main office and at the front security desk. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, the Parent Coordinator will send a 
parent survey towards the end of the school year (and possibly, eventually by mid-school year) to obtain such 
feedback on offered services. We will also consider scheduling a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and 
languages represented in our school to gather additional feedback.
