Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

To provide all students with a safe and nurturing environment that promotes high expectations through academic 
rigor, exposure to the arts, and a college bound culture. Students will be provided with a core curriculum that is rich 
and rigorous which respects diversity in students’ learning styles. We have one guiding principle: Excellent Instruction 
in Every Classroom. We strive for our students to be college bound and prepared with the skills to succeed in the 21st 
century. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Humanities and the Arts is a small high school consisting of 425 students(55% female). About 92 percent of the 
student population is Black or Hispanic. Student Attendance hovers around 88 percent. The school is unique in its 
fusion of an Arts program with an academic program that has been steadily increasing in scope and breadth, in 
particular over the past six years. On the academic side, the school is part of the 21 st Century Grant awarded to 
Queensborough Community College four years ago. Students at Humanities and the Arts attend classes for college 
credit, free of charge, from the second semester of their Freshman year, until they graduate. They are also a part of 
the Nursing Program offered by the college. The school also partners with Queens College and the College Now 
programs at both Queensborough Community College and York College. Humanities and the Arts HS also offers a 
plethora of rigorous AP-level courses including AP English Literature and Composition and AP U.S. History and 
Government.  

The College Naviance program is a mainstay of the school, which fosters opportunities for students to experience 
extended visits to colleges, preparing for college and training students in their leadership program on how to be Peer 
Leaders. School strengths are evident in the resilience that their graduates evidence in college, surpassing city 
averages.  

 

It is important to note that our small school status does not prevent us from offering students classes and training in 
the four Arts disciplines: Dance, Drama, and Music and Visual Arts, that offers AP Art Studio and has an accredited 
college curriculum in the Portfolio class that culminates in AP Studio Art. 

Humanities and the Arts partners with A&E Networks, Young Audiences, Teens on Broadway and HA! Theater 
company. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Based on performance and Achieve 3000 data, students with disabilities are entering about two to three levels below 
than expected grade levels in regards to reading, writing, and math skills. Literacy is a foundational issue for our SWD 
as they struggle with fluent reading and comprehension skills. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our most positive data comes form effective leadership Based on an analysis of the data from School Quality Guide, 
the key areas of focus this year continue to be development of teacher pedagogy and an instructional approach that 
engages all learners and provides them with opportunities to show high levels of thinking.  

Our most recent Quality Review also indicates a need for curricula aligned assessment practices that inform 
instruction, and a need for increased levels of research-based, effective instruction that yields high quality student

work, that will address the need for our students to achieve higher scores on the SAT and Regents’ exams, thereby 
meeting the College Readiness index.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
● For the 2018-2019 school year, we have met NYS AYP in English for all subgroups. However, according to Regents 
results in English Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science, there is an indication for a need to improve Literacy. For 
example, we have noticed a trend that students are not answering short answer questions at all and if they do they 
are not getting full credit for these type of questions. This goal represents the decision that through improving 
literacy, students will be able to score higher on their Regents exams.  

● As per NYS data, we have not met AYP in Math for the 2018-2019 school year. Improving student math scores on 
the regents is a priority for the school.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the school will ensure that targeted instructional strategies to improve writing across the curriculum are 
implemented that will result in a 3 % increase in the number of students reaching college readiness scores on the ELA 
regents.

State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
The parent coordinator plays a significant role in keeping parents involved. The parent coordinator also acts as out 
college adviser to further assist parents to understand the importance of advance courses like Advance Placement 
classes along with understanding college readiness. We will collaborate with the parent coordinator to provide 
targeted workshops for parents on topics such as college application system, SAT requirements, and how to support 
their child in creating an environment at home that is conducive to their child's learning process.

welfare of our students. Our attendance rate increased by 2.5%.  

● Title I funding was utilized to hire an additional Guidance Counselor thereby providing more support for students 
across the school.  

● As part of the attendance initiative, select teachers were assigned the responsibility (during their C6) to monitor and 
analyze at-risk student attendance. Rewards and incentives were an integral part of this program.  

● All students conferences with their guidance counselor at least two or more times to discuss their academic and 
received emotional support throughout the school year.  

● We want to increase the 57% student 2015-2016 survey response regarding teacher helping struggling student. To 
that end, we are assigning teachers as mentors to a specific number of students to provide one one support. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

● An analysis of teacher performance as per the ADVANCE system indicates that 57% of teachers were rated 
developing or ineffective in Domain component 3d. Conversely, 80 % of our staff were rated effective in classroom 
environment and management. 

● The 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot indicates that student progress is “approaching” target. Strengthening 
teacher performance in Domain 3 will have a direct effect on student performance.  

● Allocating time in a more methodical and systematic manner will provide for multiple opportunities for 
collaboration. Teachers will engage in cycles of inquiry that will increase both teacher and student performance.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

School leaders will use the ADVANCE observational system to help teachers set and track goals for for teacher 
pedagogical improvement. By June 2019, there will be a 10 percent increase in the number of teachers who receive 
effective ratings in Danielson component 3d: Assessment.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strong family ties is a strength for our school as nearly 50% of parents responded positively to school communication 
as per our 2017-2018 school quality guide. According to the 2015-2016 Quality Snapshot(this is the most current data 
available), 89% of Parents indicated that they were “satisfied with the education their children received.” The City 
Average and Borough Average were 75% and 80% respectively. Therefore, we have determined that it is a necessary 
goal to improve parents perception of our school and develop more events to encourage parent involvement thereby 
giving parents a voice in shaping our school.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Our school leaders actively engage in conversations with CUNY as well as private universities such as Fordham, 
Columbia Teacher’s College, and NYU. These partnerships take place during the school year where students are taking 
education courses, observe our classes and are also part of student teaching. This interaction helps us identify highly 
qualified candidates and recruit them for future positions. Some of these candidates are hired as Substitutes and 
others to permanent positions. We also identify vacancies in Open Market and conduct thorough interviews as well as 
classroom demonstrations where a team of administrators, teachers, and students are able to observe and provide 
feedback to the Principal regarding the candidates. All ATRs assigned to our school are interviewed when vacancies 
are available. We also review all teachers’ licenses (BEDs Survey) and collaborate with our Program Office so that they 
schedule teachers to teach under proper licenses. We provide professional development utilizing Title I funds. In 
order to support and continue to develop our highly qualified teachers, we provide individualized professional 
development utilizing services from DOE School Support services. Our cabinet discusses strengths and weaknesses of 
teachers and creates a yearly PD plan designed to address areas of need as identified via ADVANCE. We are also 
currently working with our Borough Field Support Center and are training our administrators to utilize the Danielson 
rubric as a professional development and evaluation tool. We have held meetings with the Talent Coach to 
mainstream observation and ensure quality control.  

For new teachers, we create a welcoming atmosphere by having a welcome to our school lunch with them and doing 
school wide and neighborhood walks. We celebrate teacher successes throughout the year.We also have the 
Principals Round Table which welcomes all staff to share thoughts about improving any facet of the school. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Conduct bi-monthly MoSL training along with Circular 6 and modified schedule meetings with staff and administration 
to encourage collaboration. The Principal and Assistant Principals have attended several meetings with Borough Field 
Support Staff to enhance high quality instruction for all students and staff. Teachers are frequently referred to the 
“Teacher Professional Development and Student Opportunities” website to identify PDs to support the 
implementation of the CCSS. Conduct PDs through the CollegeBoard® to further assist in the implementation of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36

share-decisions concerning assessments and grading policy are made through the Inquiry cycle. Teachers and 
administration collaborate to identify components of State assessments and use the data to inform instruction and 
assessment (inquiry process). During vertical and horizontal teacher teams, best practices regarding effective 
assessments are discussed and used to support student growth. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Humanities and the Arts High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Humanities and the Arts High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The funding will be used to ease the transition of incoming 9th and 10th grade ELL students into 
the NYC public school system. This will be accomplished by delivering a literacy program 
focused on reading comprehension and writing skills. The program will consist of 1-2 ELL 
teachers meeting 1.5 hours, the third Saturday of every month, and after school October 2018 - 
June 2019 (from 3:05-4:10).  The language of instruction is English delivered by the ENL 
teachers.  Students will be provided with an opportunity to conduct research on topics of their 
interest. Through research in their home language and use of electronic translator and aid of ENL 
teacher, students will have an opportunity to fully understand topics in Social Studies, Math and 
Science and be prepared for Regents exams in these disciplines. Bilingual glossaries, 
dictionaries, and tablets are provided to all students in content areas to provide additional 
language support. A bilingual math substitute teacher (Spanish) has been hired to support our 
students three times per week. We will purchase Achieve3000 and MaxScholar to support 
student literacy.

learners.  The information/resources obtained will be turn-keyed and shared with general 
education collaborative teachers, teaching this population.  The ENL teachers will host bi-
monthly in-house professional development sessions during our designated Monday PD time 
(1:40-3:00). Supplemental PD opportunities/topics will also be explored during our Vertical 
Team meetings. Topics include (but not limited to):

Studies and Science).  The Performance Series/ Scantron exams provides detailed CCLS-aligned data for each student, as well 
as Lexile levels for reading proficiency.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ALEKS is a similar program that is used for strengthening Math skills.  We have developed a school-wide Literacy program 
aimed at strengthening content-level literacy across the disciplines. In our vertical teams, we are working on realigning our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

lesson plans to include disciplinary literacy (i.e. Word walls, literacy-oriented tasks, Vocabulary acquisition, etc.). Teachers are 
also restructuring their lessons to include grammar support; focusing on the basics of sentence structure and parts of speech. 
A school-wide literacy action plan has been developed to systematically address issues around literacy. All stakeholders, 
administrators, faculty, students, parents, etc. will take an active role in contributing to the literacy action plan.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
As an indication of the success of our program, our data reveals that our ELLs are passing their content area 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have an action plan to support students to obtaining passing scores on their Regents exams and content area classes. The 
action plan includes English, ENL, S.S. and Science tutoring. Teachers are required to call students' homes to ensure that they 
are coming to tutoring. These interventions are logged into iO Classroom anecdotals. Saturday Regents Prep is also available 
for students wishing to receive extra help outside of the regular school week. Guidance counselors and ELL teachers provide 
students with the consent forms to attend tutoring as needed. The ELL teacher has a double period. Students are programmed 
accordingly to ensure that they are meeting their required hours of ELL support. General education teachers are encouraged 
to differentiate and translate documents presented to ELL students and are held accountable as such in observations.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The overall NYSESLAT scores indicate that 25% of our ELL population is performing at the Beginner/Entering Level , 13% is 
performing at the Low Intermediate /Emerging level,  17% performs at the Intermediate/Transitioning Level,  33% is at the 
Advanced/Expanding level  and 12% has reached the Proficient/Commanding Level.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Students are programmed according to their ELL needs (i.e. # of hours needed). They are also programmed with a double 
period of ELL support. ELL teachers push into the ELA classes to further strengthen our Literacy initiative. All teachers are 
provided with ELL levels at the beginning of the school year to support them in structuring effective groups and make 
meaningful adjustments to instruction.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ELL are programmed according to their grade (9th/10th graders and 11th/12 graders) and are homogeneously 
programmed according to their proficiency level on the NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL. Students are also receiving 
two periods of ENL Reading and Writing. The ENL teachers are integrated in the ELA classes. Therefore, ENL students 
receive support from ENL trained teachers in both ELA classes and in stand-alone ENL classes. The ENL teacher groups 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

students according to need in her stand-alone classes. Students within the proficient/commanding level have even 
been programmed for AP classes, thereby ensuring equity and access to all students.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 
N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

A 
All students are provided with appropriate ENL classes based on scores attained on the NYSITELL and the York State English as 
a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT).  Ours is a freestanding ENL Program.  Instruction is provided by a licensed 
ENL teacher.  Our program fully addresses compliance with CR Part 154 for English as a New Language by providing our ELL 
student population with the required units of ENL instruction: 
Beginner/Entering Level Classes: 180 minutes of Standalone ENL and 360 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or content area. Low 
Intermediate/Emerging: 90 minutes of Standalone ENL and 270 minutes integrated ENL/ELA or content area. 
Intermediate/Transitioning:  90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes content area, Advanced/Expanding:  180 minutes 
integrated ENL/ELA or content area, Proficient/Commanding:  90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA or content area. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core content is delivered through a licensed content area instructor with support services from the ENL and ISS teachers. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At registration, the Guidance Counselors, Ms. Aris and/or Ms. Leacock, and the ENL Teachers, Ms. Dixon and Ms. Isaacs and a 
staff member that speaks the family Home Language interviews the parent and student to determine fluency in the home 
language. In the event that the student to be registered speaks a low incident language, the Interpretation and Translation 
Unit assist with the evaluation.  Spanish language speakers are administered the Spanish language LAB to further determine 
students' level of literacy.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We serve SIFE students by implementing differentiated instruction.  This will include: pairing with stronger academic students, 
pairing with cultural buddy and providing one-on-one instruction.  Besides programming ELLs who have been in US schools less 
than three years (newcomers) into the recommended periods of ENL instruction, these students are encouraged to attend 
tutoring during their lunch period and before or after school hours where the results of Periodic Assessment data are analyzed 
and instruction is provided to meet their individual deficiencies.  One to one tutoring is also available to all of our ELLs 
(Newcomers and Developing ELLS) where the student’s proficiency level needs in reading and writing are individually 
addressed.  Furthermore, emphasis is placed on academic language and students are allowed extended time on Regents 
Exams.  With regards to long-term ELLs (in NYC school six years or more), the following program/services are available to 
ensure that our long term ELL population meets the Next Generation Learning Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy 
in history/social studies, science, and mathematics 
     Small class size

     ICT classes which provide content area and ICT methodology 
     One-on-one small group instruction during students' lunch periods and extended day with content area teachers 
     Counseling sessions with parent and child with Principal, AP Administration, Guidance Counselor and Social Worker. 
     All of our ELLs are further supported with the following resources: 
        Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries 
Beginner Level students are paired with a student translators 
Increase Number of ELLs taking PSAT and SAT Exams 
Continued implementation of the Continuum for Academic Rigor and Excellence Document 
        Extended time and separate location during the administration of Regents Exams 
        Translations of the content area Regents exams 
We continue to support Former ELLs students who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT through tutoring and Regents 
preparatory classes.  Regents testing accommodations have been extended to former ELLs.  The testing accommodations for 
former ELLs  include separate locations, extended time,  dictionary and glossaries and home language versions of the Regents 
exams.  Furthermore, ELLs who require more than four years to graduate are provided with extensive Academic Instructional 
Support: small 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 
All students, especially ELL-SWD’s are provided opportunities to practice active participation in their learning.  Through 
conversations and discussions in class with teachers and other students ELL-SWD’s develop language skills as well as broaden 
their knowledge and understanding of subject matter.  Students are encouraged to collaborate with peers and utilize 
cooperative learning strategies.  Teachers model how to pose questions and make comments in small discussion groups which 
ultimately organizes student directed discussions.  Overall, teachers use a variety of strategies when teaching literacy to access 
their student’s needs and determine how to proceed with instruction in the advancement of literacy.  Materials include: 
  Grade Level Text 
          ILearn 
          Audio/Video recordings 
          Manipulatives 
          Graphic Organizers 
          Tables/Charts/Index Cards 
              
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
When accessing the least restrictive environment ELL-SWDs have the same opportunities as the general education 
student.  Our ELL - 
SWD students are programmed in Collaborative ICT classes where they are mainstreamed with the general population.  They 
are 
provided with grade level texts to better accommodate their reading and comprehension levels.  They are heterogeneously 
grouped to afford greater opportunities in meeting their long and short term annual goals.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We offer the following targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, science and other content areas.  All targeted 
            intervention is offered in English: 
             One to one tutoring in the content area with targeted intervention in ELA, math, science and social studies 
             After school academic intervention on Wednesday and Thursday by content area teachers from 3:00pm to 4:30pm 
             Saturday Regents Prep Classes 9:00-12:00 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

             One-on one small group instruction during students' lunch periods 
             Counseling sessions with parent and child with Principal, AP Administration, Guidance Counselor and Social Worker. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In order to meet CR Part 154 requirements, the Integrated Co- Teaching model in content area classes has been 
implemented.  Students programs will be blocked based on proficiency and grade level in both ENL and Content area 
classes.  ENL and content area teacher will have co-planning time (5th period).   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

The Campus Magnet Complex  ENL model whereby one standalone, self-contained ENL program served all ELLs in Q 492, Q494, 
Q496 and Q498 was discontinued. The reason for this discontinuance is due to an increased number of ENL students entering 
each of our school. Because of this increase in numbers, each school felt they could support their students most appropriately 
by providing direct support, by their own hired ENL teachers.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are encouraged to participate in all after school activities and events.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELLs are supported in the ELL classroom and in their content area classes.  Their listening and reading comprehension needs 
are addressed through the use of articles, novels, movies and documentaries.  Skedula is used to track student progress.  ELL 
students have access to dictionaries, content specific glossaries and flash cards to support them. All students also receive 
differentiated handouts in all their classes according to their levels. Teachers have received PD on including more visual aides 
to support ELL students. Entering students receive the greatest amount of supports. Commanding students receive ELL 
supports as needed as they are entitled to it even after they've successfully passed the NYSESLAT.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Since we provide a standalone, self contained, ELL program, which focuses on intense development of academic language and 
on cognates to accelerate comprehension, we are unable to compare the English performance of our ELL population to 
performance in their native language.  However, the native language support is used as a bridge to transferring receptive and 
expressive second language acquisition.   All students are provided with a home language bilingual glossary for support in the 
content area classes.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required support services and resources are targeted for grades 9-12, thus they correspond to our ELLs age and grade 
level.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELLs are supported in the ELL classroom and disciplinary classes through tablets, dictionaries, glossaries, and translated 
teacher developed documents.   Their listening and reading comprehension needs are addressed through the use of articles, 
novels, movies and documentaries.  Skedula is used to track student progress.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Prior to the beginning of the school year, incoming students and their parents/guardians are invited to attend the school’s 
open house and orientation.  They are introduced to Mr. Kayode Ayetiwa, Principal; Ghandi Moussa, AP 
Administration;  Matina Stergiopoulos, A.P. Supervision;  Jewyll Leacock and Danielle Aris, Guidance Counselors. Parent 
Coordinator, Karima Tonge also meets with parents in September to welcome ELL families to our school. All are given a tour of 
the building and provided with welcome documents and packets.

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish foreign language classes are offered as mandated for graduation and as electives for students that pursue an 
Advanced Regents Diploma.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for all ELL personnel and all teachers of ELLs at the school is to ensure registration and 
attendance to Professional Development trainings at least once a month to attain resources that can be applied in the 
classroom. Increasing awareness and available resources to enhance not only growth for the teachers, but also increase the 
students growth and development as well.  
 
In house professional development training on best practices in the classroom are offered during OPW on Mondays by both 
staff and Administration. Staffs attending off site professional development training are encouraged to turn key the 
information that they received with their colleagues. Professional Development training on the use of Danielson framework 
and the Next Generation Learning Standards  is also another support that the teachers of ELLs receives on a monthly basis.   PD 
opportunities are provided through QSBFSC, QNBFSC and through the Department of Literacy.  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff members are given the opportunity to review their students data.  Teachers are given the opportunity to look and discuss 
their students' work with colleagues.  Teachers review English Language Learners,Lowest third, Special Education stats on a 
daily basis.  Teachers are given the opportunity to discuss best practices and conduct inquiry work.  This year, ESL teacher has 
been given the opportunity to co-teach and discuss ENL methodology with content teachers.  ENL teacher provides content 
Area teachers with resources on providing sheltered Instruction.  Content Area teachers working with ENL teacher to  co-plan 
during times allotted for Common Planning.  English Language Learners are given the opportunity to participate in all school 
activities, join various clubs and exposed to the American English language and culture.   
Our Professional Development is on- going .  Teachers are not only discussing about the  ELLs but all other 
students.  Professional Development     focuses on best practices and working collaboratively.  Teachers work together on 
discussing methodologies such as sheltered instruction for English Language Learners, differentiations , help improve the arts 
of teaching and to effectively Co-teach.  All agendas, resources and attendance sheet are put in a PD binder which is kept in 
the Assistant Principal's office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Schools meets with the parents or guardians of ELLs once every semester, in addition parent -teacher conference and parent 
orientation meetings,  to discuss their child's language development progress, their Periodic Assessment results and the child's 
language development in all content areas.  School records attendance and provides interpretation/translation services.  The 
goals of the program are explained to parents during a family orientation meeting as well as during parent teacher 
conferences. ENL teachers review Skedula and Performance Series data with parents. Data from the Performance 
Series/Scantron and ALEKS is also shared with parents during these meetings. Language development needs in content areas 
are explained by the content area teachers. If in any of these meetings translation is required, we use a staff member who is 
fluent in the language and/or contact the translation unit. The individual needs of students are always shared with parents 
through Parent Teacher meetings, phone calls home, letters sent home, report cards, etc. Most of these interactions and 
communications are chronicled in Skedula using anecdotal logs.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our school organizes parent workshops that foster parent involvement.  Examples of our workshops are: 
Title I / Title III 
Preparing for college 
Next Generation Learning Standards 
Transitioning into high school

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kayode Ayetiwa, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data from the following sources is used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 
and oral communication:  

-Findings from the Home Language Survey 

-ATS reports 

-Individualized, personal meetings with parents, students, and other family members legally responsible for the 
students 

-Information included in the blue emergency cards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

Upon entering our school, families are met with a staff member who speaks the native language. If a staff 
member is not available, the translation unit is contacted to provide this additional support.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
