Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We will educate our students to become leaders, problem solvers and critical thinkers through the collaborative 
efforts of parents, teachers and school leaders. We believe that Common Core aligned instruction will provide the 
foundation for each individual student’s success. This vision is to be achieved through an enriched, nurturing 
environment steeped in a culture of mutual respect. We believe that respect and support for the individual will 
cultivate socially responsible and self-confident students, ready to become productive members of the global 
community.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 274 is an elementary school that recently received a Principal's Performance Review in March, 2018. We were 
rated "Effective or Highly Effective" ” on all Quality Review indicators1.1 (curriculum), 1.2 (pedagogy), 1.3 
(Instructional Focus), 1.4 (Trust), 2.2 (Assessment), 3.1 (Vision for Improvement), 3.4 (High Expectations), 4.1 
(Danielson Observations), 4.2 (Teacher Teams and Leadership Development) and 5.1 (Policies and Practices for 
Improvement). Areas that were celebrated were 3.4, Communicating clear, consistent and high expectations and 4.1, 
Having clear systems in place to integrate the analysis of student work and data into feedback cycles.  

 

What makes P.S. 274 distinctive is the collegial climate between school leaders, staff, parents and students that 
results in a concerted effort to strive for the success of every student. School leaders and staff demonstrate their 
commitment to achieving this goal by working and planning collaboratively, meeting regularly and engaging each 
other in professional dialogue that focuses on improving student learning. P.S. 274 fosters academic success by 
exposing students to the Arts. Students participate in chorus, music, theater, visual arts and dance. New teachers are 
welcomed and mentored by veteran teachers and school leaders, leading to greater staff stability. We have a diverse 
community of students coming from many countries including Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, 
China, and Tibet.  

 

The school provides many opportunities for collaboration between parents and staff. There are monthly PTA and 
School Leadership Team meetings; we also offer Coffee with the Principal sessions on the final Monday of each 
month. This forum gives parents an opportunity to openly communicate and engage the principal regarding concerns 
and questions about our school. Parent workshops are provided by our staff members, the PTA, and community 
based organizations. The PTA works closely with staff to organize, implement and facilitate activities that empower 
our parents. Our teacher teams supported by our U-Lit Coach, conduct Parent Academy workshops during Parent 
Engagement time on Tuesdays aligned to the needs of our students and curriculum. 

 

P.S. 274 collaborates with several community based organizations including but not limited to New Victory Theatre, 
Mosa Mack, Brooklyn Academy of Music, DISNEY, Hope Lodge, Food Bank of New York, CookShop, Brooklyn Botanic 
Gardens, NY Cares and New York Psychotherapy. These programs provide services and opportunities that address the 
academic, social and emotional needs of our community. A partnership with NY Psychotherapy offers counseling 
services at the school which provides external resources to meet the needs of students and families. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 274 has three special student populations, Students in Temporary Housing, Students with IEPs and English as new 
Learners. The specific needs of these subgroups are met through heterogeneously grouped classroom settings, 
instruction that incorporates a variety of scaffolds to provide all students with access to the learning as well as 
technological supports. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on the results of the 2017-18 School Quality Guide and the Framework for Great Schools our strengths were 
Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment and Trust. The overall score for Collaboration category was 4.87. 
100% of teachers surveyed responded "That at their school, the principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make the 
school run effectively." The overall score for Supportive Environment was 4.45. 100% of teachers responded positively 
that "The principal sets clear expectations for teachers about implementing what they have learned in professional

development." The school demonstrated growth across each element identified in the Multi-year Summary section of 
the School Quality Guide. 

Our key area of focus for this year relates to our 2017-18 Principal Performance Observation, our focus for the year 
will continue to be centered around strengthening student discourse and teacher practice..  

 

 

Based on feedback from our school’s 2017-18 Principal's Performance Observation report and our self reflection, the 
following areas were identified as strengths: 

 

● The principal strategically communicates clear, consistent and high expectations to the school community which 
fosters a shared vision through a focused set of academic and personal behaviors across the school. (3.4) 

 

● The school's shared vision also focuses on engaging students in the arts, STEM work and music, where students 
participate in chorus, theatre, visual arts and dance. (3.4) 

 

● The principal has established structures that cultivate a culture of respect which is supportive and results in a safe 
and inclusive learning environment. Respect permeates the school encouraging adult and student learning. (1.4) 

● The students are well known by the staff who work together to encourage promising work habits via the school's 
Positive Behavior Intervention System. (1.4) 

 

 

The following areas were identified as areas for improvement: 

 

● Elevate the manner in which teachers create or use assessments to include a variety of professional cycles of 
learning on the use of formative assessments and a range of modalities teachers may use throughout the lessons to 
obtain valuable information regarding the student learning gaps. (2.2) 

 

 

● Continue to support teachers in providing guidance to individual and groups of students. so that students are aware 
of their next learning steps and teachers make informed instructional adjustments. (2.2)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our Principal Performance Observation in 2017-18 indicated the following areas the school does well: 

Strong teaching practices are shared with those needing the most support.  

 
  Teachers reflect on best practices supported by the Danielson Framework for Teaching along with the analysis 

of learning outcomes to elevate school wide instructional practices.  

  Professional development decisions are based on the identified needs of individual and or groups of teachers.  

As per the 2017-18 end of year Advance data the following was identified as a focus area for our school: 

  Continue to support teachers in establishing school wide expectations which include teaching strategies that 

will embed rigorous activities, access to learning and engagement, so that all learners can successfully 
participate in grade level content and increase ownership of their learning.  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will build teacher capacity through teachers' participation in Collaborative Lesson Plan Study groups 
where teachers will develop four lesson plans that include rigorous learning activities that make learning accessible and 
ensure engagement for all learners. The efficacy of each lesson will be measured using the Danielson Framework and 
the expectation is that 100% of the lessons will be rated 'Effective' or higher.

start and end 
date? 

Key Personnel 
Who is responsible 
for implementing 
and overseeing the 
activity/strategy? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

Grade level teams of teachers will participate in four Lesson 
Study Cycles. Each Lesson Study Cycle will include each team 
collaboratively creating a lesson, one teacher in the team 
implementing the lesson while the team uses the Danielson 
rubric to (informally) evaluate the lesson. The team then 
engages in a reflection and debrief of the lesson to determine 
the level of rigor, access and engagement in each lesson.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Areas that we demonstrated as a strength for the 2017-2018 school year based upon our attendance reports: 

 

September, October and November were our highest attendance months with rates of 94.3%, 93.5% and 
92.2% respectively. 

  The September Attendance Pledge contract proved to be our most successful attendance strategy.  
  Attendance notifications to parents of chronic students also communicated clear attendance expectations to 

all parents. 

An area that we demonstrated as a strength for the 2016-2017 school year based upon the School Quality guide is : 

100% of teachers who teach students in grades pk through 5 agree or strongly agree that their students are safe in 
their classes. 

  An area that we have identified as a need for the 2017-2018 school year: 
  December 2017 through April 2018 proved to be our most challenging attendance months. We struggled to 

meet our school wide average of 95% attendance with the exception of one day in each of those months. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 we will achieve a minimum of 40 attendance days where we are successful in achieving our school wide 
average attendance rate of 95%. This will be measured by our monthly attendance ( RPAR) reports.

and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Principal's Performance Observation Report during the 2017-2018 school year indicated the following areas the 
school does well: 

  The principal strategically communicates clear and intentional high expectations to the entire school 

community.  

  Teachers engage in learning walks and share feedback to one another on the quality of feedback given to 

student work. 

  Classroom assessment practices are driven from teacher teamwork in the form of learning progressions used 

across grades.  

  The principals transparency with staff in regards to school data (Advance, NYS assessment, School Quality 
Guide) to determine school wide goals was discussed with all stake holders ( Staff and parents) in order to 
establish a shared vision. 

As per the Principal's Performance Observation Report during the 2017-2018 school year, the following was identified 
as an area of focus for our school: 

  Encourage teacher engagement around analyzing student work using benchmarks, applying findings to their 

practice and revisit in cycles to analyze the impact of such practices. 

  Provide common planning sessions that allow teachers to plan rigorous activities that include academic 
vocabulary and intentional scaffolds to ensure access and engagement so that all learners can increase 
ownership of their learning. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teacher teams will participate in a minimum of two cycles of inquiry in ELA focused on ELA standards R.L 2 
and 3. Teacher teams will analyze student baseline assessment data, develop a six week plan of action and re-evaluate 
students at the conclusion of the cycle; students will demonstrate an increase of 5 percentage points on each standard.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in 
DOE systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

As of 
6/20/18, 
there were 
89 students 
identified as 
Students in 
Temporary

Because of the large number of students identified in our testing grades, our school plans to offer after school support 
to our STH students. We will offer both academic intervention and enrichment after school programs for these 
students based upon results of the 2017-18 NYS ELA and Math Exam for our upper grades and baseline assessments 
for our lower grades. We will also continue to purchase basic emergency supplies for our STH students to be 
distributed as needed.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In order to attract high-quality teachers, there are several strategies that we have implemented. Various recruitment 
methods have been used including T.R.Q., NYC Teaching Fellows program, outreach to colleges with accredited 
education programs and attending job fairs to search for qualified teachers to employ. In addition, staff members 
actively seek qualified personnel for recruitment. 

Another strategy we use is to begin the staffing process earlier by implementing a staff survey (preference sheet) in 
the spring to identify possible vacancies for the upcoming school year in order to place current staff members in 
positions within their certification area.  

Workshops are offered with the assistance of the UFT for teachers devoted to certification and licensing 
requirements. Mentors are also assigned to new teachers to counsel, advise and support them in implementing best 
instructional practices. Teachers of Tomorrow grants are offered to new teachers in our school in collaboration with 
the New York State Education Department. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Constituents of the school community (teachers, principals and paraprofessionals) attend various workshop offered 
by NYCDOE and in our professional learning sessions . In addition to these professional learning opportunities, the 
school designs workshops tailored to meet the needs of our teachers and students. Teachers turnkey professional 
learning opportunities providing on-going support of implementation of research based strategies. Our Administrative 
Team works closely with teacher teams and individual teachers to set professional goals and develop a support 
program. Some professional development strategies that are incorporated into the instructional support program by 
Administration are: reflection & self assessment conferences, observing experienced effective teachers, mentoring, 
peer coaching, analyzing student work and non-evaluative cycles of observation.

intervention services, etc.). 
To ensure a smooth transition from preschool to the elementary school program, letters are sent to all local 
preschools to invite potential families to participate in school orientations. During orientations, families are presented 
with an overview of the Kindergarten curriculum. They have the opportunity to visit Kindergarten classrooms while in 
session and observe a lesson. Families are also given a tour of the school and the programs offered at our school are 
highlighted. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Horizontal and vertical teacher teams meet to discuss and decide upon appropriate student assessment measures. 
Various forms of data are analyzed to create action plans and next steps to inform instruction. Professional learning 
opportunities are provided through various sources (NYCDOE, Administration & instructional coaches and Brooklyn 
Field Support office) where teachers analyze data for trends, patterns and determine instructional implications. The 
curriculum is then modified accordingly. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 274, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 274 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report;

Our Title III funding will be used to promote language development for our ELLs through a 
supplemental program called ELL Academy. The program will take place after school twice a 
week on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40 PM to 4:10 PM. There will be a total of 20 
sessions beginning October 3, 2018 to December 13, 2018. We will have five classes focusing on 
the following programs: a K-1 Dual Language bridge class with alternating days (Wednesday 
being English, Thursday being Spanish), a K-1 bridge class working with Fundations and Teach 
Me Writing, a 2nd grade class doing a combination of PAF (Preventing Academic Failure) and 
Teach Me Writing focusing on personal narrative and opinion writing, a 3rd and 4th grade bridge 
class working  with Time for Kids focusing on opinion writing across Science and Social 
Studies, and a 5th grade class participating in a Book Club reading non-fiction Social 
Studies/Science texts and writing reviews of the literature . The subgroups will be as follows: 
newcomers in grades K-2, developing ELLs in grades 3-5, and former ELLs.  There will be an 
average of 15 students to a certified ENL teacher per class. For the Dual Language class, 
instruction will be in both English and Spanish. For all other classes, instruction will be in 
English for reading and writing. There will be a method of maintaining attendance records where 
each service provider will get an attendance sheet to mark which students are present for the 
program. Those sheets will be collected and stored in a folder. All copies of program 
notifications in parents' preferred languages will be kept in a binder in the ENL Coordinator's 
office. 
The target population is all ELLs in grades K-5 that scored Transitioning and Expanding on the 
reading/writing strands of the NYSESLAT. We will also invite former ELLs, who tested out for 
up to two years, to participate in the program.  The instructional groups and group sizes will be 
as follows: 16 students in K-1 DL, 18 students in K-1 Bridge, and 17 students in Second 
grade.  In grades 3-4 we will target 8 students in 3rd and 8 students in 4th. They will be grouped 
as a bridge class.  In grade 5 we will invite 16 students that scored Transitioning or Expanding in 
reading/writing and former ELLs.   
 
The focus of the 2018-2019 ELL Academy has been determined after analyzing the 2018 
NYSESLAT results. This data source indicated that reading and writing continue to pose a 
challenge for our Transitioning and Expanding ELL population.  The ELL Academy will provide 
a balance of opportunities for children to engage in reading and writing in meaningful ways. 
They will also receive explicit instruction and strategies they need to become commanding 
ELLs. The program will incorporate high-interest and grade appropriate supplemental materials 
that are aligned to the Common Core ELA standards as well as the New Language Arts 
Progressions (NLAP). 
 
To support our kindergarten and first grade Dual Language students,  we will purchase " 
bilingual Guided Reading materials and a subscription to Reading A-Z. They will be able to 
practice reading as well as work with technology. The K-1 bridge class will purchase "Language 
Power". This program will expose our ELLs to content and academic language connected to 
themes.  Language Power will address all four modalities, providing our students with the 
opportunity to interact with text on a range of topics, genres and content areas.  Also, they will

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
have a chance to write about their learning using text evidence.  This program will build 
language proficiency using leveled books with high interest topics and strong visual support. In 
addition, first graders will be receiving guided reading instruction in order to enhance their 
reading skills. For grade 2, we will purchase "Preventing Academic Failure (PAF)".  It is a 
comprehensive program for teaching reading, writing, and spelling in the primary grades using 
multi-sensory techniques.  It includes a phonics component, oral reading, instructional sequence, 
repeated reading, decodable texts, and comprehension strategies.  We will also purchase 
supplemental bundles for personal narratives and opinion writing. Our 3rd and 4th graders will 
use "Time for Kids" which include magazines, articles, and other non-fiction texts. They will 
respond to their reading with opinion writing across Science and Social Studies. For our ELLs in 
grade 5 we will implement a Book Club. The English Language instruction of this program will 
provide opportunities for students to read for multiple purposes, develop oral language skills by 
participating in discussions, and write reviews of the books they read. We believe that these 
approaches to language acquisition will afford students the practical experiences they need to 
improve their language and literacy skills in a safe, supportive and engaging environment. 
For additional support in writing, students will utilize technology (SMART Boards, lap tops, 
Elmos, iPads) for extra scaffolding in writing.  To support the implementation and smooth 
running of the program, general materials will be purchased (talking dictionaries, talking 
thesauruses, writing journals). 
All of the instructional materials used in this program are supplemental and distinct from daily 
instruction.

Part C: Professional Development  
Teachers will also attend the 42nd Annual SABE Teacher Institute in the spring of 
2019. Teachers will be afforded the opportunity to participate actively in a wide variety of 
workshops and presentations on best pedagogical practices for bilingual and ENL 
learners.  Teachers will turn key information presented at this conference during common 
planning time across all grades and during our ENL Cohort Meetings.    
Professional Development will be offered to our teachers during the Chancellor's Conference 
Day in November, PDs by DELLS, Lunch and Learns, grade level conferences, and monthly 
ENL Cohort meetings.  The topics to be discussed this year will be as follows: 
 
•            Analyzing the NYSESLAT Data (1 hr. September 2018) by K. Minogue, Assistant 
Principal/ENL Program Supervisor. Teachers will become aware and knowledgeable about 
NYSESLAT scores and understand the implications of the data.  The ENL Coordinator will help 
analyze data to best group the students for daily instruction. This will ensure that the ELLs 
receive instruction that is appropriate to their level. 
•             Language Progressions- What They are and how to use Them (September 2018) by Ms. 
Aguinaga, ENL Coordinator. This will help plan effective lessons that will benefit all levels of 
ELLs, teachers will attend this PD that will equip teachers with different ideas and activities for 
each progression with activities on their level. The students can then receive instruction that is 
accessible. 
 
•             Using Curriculum, Assessment Measures, Instructional Strategies and Scaffolding for 
Reading/Writing  (1 hr. November, 2018). Teachers will gain new strategies for scaffolding 
reading and writing for the ELLs. This will help our ELLs gradually gain independence as the 
scaffolding changes based on the assessments. 
 
•             Addressing the Four Modalities of the NYSESLAT (1 hr. January 2019) by L. 
Aguinaga, ENL Coordinator and Ms. Ha, ENL Lab Teacher. The presenters will help all the 
ENL teachers become aware of what the four modalities of the NYSESLAT are testing for. This 
in turn will help teachers plan for specific lessons that incorporate listening, reading, speaking, 
and writing which will ensure that the children are practicing all four modalities as much as 
possible. 
 
•             Infusing Technology into All Lessons (1 hr. January 2019)  by Mr. Videtto, Media 
Specialist. The ELLs will benefit from the teachers attending this PD by boosting engagement, as 
technology sparks student interests. 
 
In addition, teachers will be provided with reference books on best ENL practices.  A focus 
group will be formed to address questions, concerns, and explore the implementation of 
strategies and techniques for helping ELLs to raise academic achievement in the classroom. 
 
All PD sessions will have an agenda outlining the focus of the meeting as well as a sign-in 
attendance sheet. Those agendas and sign-in sheets will then be organized and kept in the ENL 
Coordinator's office in a binder as record maintenance.

In order for our parents to help their children develop a love for learning, and to keep them 
informed and engaged, we will provide various opportunities to support and collaborate with 
them.  
 
Three parents will be invited to participate in the 42nd anniversary of NYSABE Conference 
provided by the New York State Association for Bilingual Education.  This conference will take 
place in the spring of 2019.  By attending this conference, parents will be better informed about 
their children's education and opportunities available to them.  It will also allow them to reflect 
upon the importance of their involvement and the critical role they play in their child's 
educational process.  
 
Parents will be able to participate in various informative in-house workshops focusing on 
bilingual/ENL education.  These workshops will help guide parents in ways that they can support 
their children at home academically and socially. The topics to be addressed are based on 
feedback from our parents.  
 
The duration of each session will be one hour and the schedule is as follows: 
 
•             September 2018, “Informational Session on Title III" to serve as a Parent Orientation 
that shares the academic and attendance expectations of the ELL Academy. it will be led by the 
ENL Academy Teachers and the school administrators. 
 
•          December 2018,  “Love of Writing”--- facilitated by the Media Specialist. This workshop 
is intended to provide parents with ideas on how to ignite a love of writing in their children. 
 
-          January 2019 "Technology and ELLs" facilitated by Mr. Videtto. Different websites, 
programs, and apps that can help language development will be shared with the parents. 
 
-            March 2019 "NYSESLAT Informational Session" hosted by Ms. Aguinaga and Ms. Ha 
to inform parents of the components of the test as well as strategies and tips. 
 
In addition, the ENL Team is tentatively scheduling parent workshops that are open to all ELL 
parents on the first Tuesday of every other month starting in October, December, February, 
April, and June. Various topics will be covered. 
 
Parents will be notified of these activities through letters sent home as well as announcements in 
the monthly school newsletter. The letters will be translated in the parent's preferred languages. 
We will create a binder to maintain records with proper agendas, attendance logs, and copies of 
the invitations. It will be kept in the ENL Coordinator's office.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 274 uses the following assessments tools to guide instructional planning for our ELLs:•               Fountas & Pinnell Running 
Records•               ELA Benchmarks•               ENL Thematic Benchmarks•               MOSL 
•               TC Writing 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To assess reading fluency, level, and comprehension, teachers of our ELLs periodically administer running records (beginning of 
year, mid-year, and end of year).  Teachers then analyze the results in order to design specific instruction for individuals and 
small groups during guided reading.  This data revealed that our ELLs in the early childhood grades need more support in high 
frequency words, sentence complexity, academic vocabulary, word repetition, and comprehension.  To address these needs, 
teachers create guided reading groups to target specific literacy skills.  In addition, teachers use Visual Thinking Strategies 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

(VTS), a method initiated by teacher-facilitated discussions of art images, that is documented to have a cascading positive 
effect on students. It is perhaps the simplest way in which teachers and schools can provide students with key behaviors 
sought by Common Core Standards: thinking skills that become habitual and transfer from lesson to lesson, oral and written 
language literacy, visual literacy, and collaborative interactions among peers. VTS provides a way to jumpstart a process of 
learning to think deeply and it is applicable in most subjects from poetry to math to science and social studies. Based on the 
results of all these assessments and language needs, teachers develop instructional plans for small groups for each content 
area in order to promote academic success. Classroom teachers and the ENL Cohort continue to analyze the data every eight 
to ten weeks in order to ensure that students are meeting their short term goals and are on track to achieving their end of 
year goals. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
P.S. 274 uses the following summative assessments: 
•               MOSL 
•               NYS ELA / Math 
•               NYS Science 
•               ENL Thematic Benchmarks 
•               EOY Performance Tasks  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We analyze the progress of our ELLs and how they move from one level to the next by comparing data from assessments such 
as: the NYSESLAT, ENL benchmark assessments, ELA, Math, and Unit tests.  We closely monitor how our ELLs move from one 
level to the next by administering a pre and a post ENL benchmark based on each of the four modalities. The results of each 
assessment are analyzed to monitor individual student growth.  Action plans with interventions are made after analyzing this 
data to target specific needs. Progress reports are sent home quarterly to strengthen the home school connection. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
RTI and AIS: For each English Language Learner who scores below specified levels of performance on the annual English 
Language Proficiency Assessment, we will determine the additional support services to provide the students, taking into 
consideration evidence such as: •               Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education setting or an English as a New 
Language program•               English and home language literacy•               Content area and social-emotional support needs of 
students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE)•               English and home language literacy needs of long-
term ELLs•               Results from the NYSESLAT•               Content area teacher recommendation•               Parent or guardian 
request•               Sample of student work in English and, if possible, in the home language 
•               Learning style 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
•               NYSESLAT 
•               NYS ELA / Math 
•               MOSL 
    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

To disseminate our findings and make adjustments to our program, we create a Cohort Class at a Glance by grade for all of the 
ELLs. We share information the following with our teachers such as: what the student scored on the past ELA / Math state test 
(when applicable) and their NYSESLAT proficiency level. We also share a "toolkit" of strategies that can be useful for working 
with ELLs that we share with all teachers and service providers and support staff. With the data that we collect we also adjust 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

our groups when we push-in and create goals for each student. Using this data, we then decide what programs our Title III will 
best support our students and how to allocate our funds (i.e. Phonics, Writing, etc). 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school provides our ELL population with programs and services mandated by CR Part 154 as per parental 
option.  We currently have a push-in/pull-out program model for grades K-5. The students are grouped 
hetereogeneously with mixed proficiency levels by grade. We calculate the minutes for each student and enter this 
information into STARS. The minutes of service are based on each student's proficiency level (360 minutes for the 
Entering and Emerging students, 180 for the Transitional and Expanding students, and 90 minutes for the 
Commanding students). The minutes are met through both standalone ENL services and push-in services. 
 In each class, students are grouped according to their proficiency levels and targeted with differentiated instruction 
within small groups. Across all grades, we have adopted the Team Teaching model where the classroom teacher and 
the ENL Coordinator and ENL teacher plan together and co-teach during the ENL periods.  For our students with 
disabilities, we use a push-in and pull-out program.  Once a week, all ELLs receive an additional period of extra 
support from the ENL teachers to prepare them for the upcoming NYSESLAT.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Based on parent selection, our school curretnly does not have this program at this time. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

For the 2017-2018 school year, we are starting a Spanish-English dual language program in Kindergarten. We will be 
using the self-contained model. We will use the alternate day model, where the language of instruction changes on 
alternative days (for example, Monday- English, Tuesday- Spanish, Wednesday- English, etc). The room will be color-
coded in red/blue to help children identify where to find charts, Word Walls, libraries, etc. for each language. The 
class will be grouped by 50% ELLs and 50% English proficient students. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In grades K through 5, students receive mandated units of ENL instruction in accordance with the individual students’ results 
on the NYSESLAT as required by Commissioner’s Regulation Part 154 from the ENL Coordinator and ENL teachers.  Each unit of 
instruction equals 50 minutes.  ELLs at the Entering and Emerging levels will receive a total of 360 minutes of study per week, 
divided into a combination of Stand-Alone ENL and 1 unit of integrated ENL. ELLs at the Transitioning and Expanding levels will 
receive a total of 180 minutes per week, using the Integrated model. Students at the Commanding level will receive 5 units of 
study per week of Integrated ENL in ELA or content area, or other approved services for an additional 2 years. In our Dual 
Language Program, ELLs would receive content area instruction for 50% of the academic day in English and 50% in the other 
language.  Our goal would be for all students to build academic skills in their native language and eventually master these skills 
in their new language.  In the event of opening a TBE program, instruction would be provided per the guidelines as stated on 
CR Part 154-2 (K-8) Transitional Bilingual Education Program.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 All content areas are delivered in English using ENL methodologies and instructional strategies with language development 
support in the students’ native language.  We are currently using the focus programs NYC recommended: Ready Gen and Go 
Math.  The Go Math materials are available in Spanish, which include reference books, student journals, and a technology 
component. The ENL teacher is providing content area support in Social Studies and Science according to CR Part 154 to meet 
students' needs.  Teachers maintain a native language classroom library with age-and grade-appropriate books that reflect the 
current unit of study.  Students are provided with bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, technology enrichment in the native 
language,  and a buddy system to provide support for newcomers.  Teachers with groups of ELLs who have a common native 
language organize collaborative tasks that target content and generate interactions in the native language among peers. We 
ensure that ELLs are appropriately tested in their native language by conducting an informal assessment in listening, speaking, 
reading and writing to evaluate how literate the child is in their native language.  We also use the Spanish LAB as a tool of 
assessment to evaluate their proficiency levels in their native language. The instructional practices are aligned with the 
Common Core across all content areas. Cooperative learning strategies are utilized in addition to scaffolding to ensure that all 
learning styles are addressed. ELLs are encouraged to think critically, solve problems, and communicate both orally and 
written in the language of instruction. Engaging students in real-world experiences enable them to place context to the 
language they are learning. These tasks are given to allow students to apply the content they have learned. Accountable talk is 
encouraged to enhance language proficiency through discussion by modeling language acquisition for students.  Lessons are 
differentiated and choices are given to students to provide multiple entry points for taking in information.  The Dual Language 
Program uses the Wonders program which includes Spanish and English literacy, phonics, and guided reading components. For 
math they will use Go Math in English and in Spanish. To promote the learning of two languages the room will be divided in 
half-English and half-Spanish and color coded blue and red respectively. There will be libraries in both languages and guided 
reading and small group instruction will be given in both languages as well.   
  
           
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

To ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, they are permitted to use their native language 
abilities to complete tasks.  They are also allowed to express their knowledge in the language they are most familiar with when 
being assessed.  By allowing our students to use their native language to process their answers during assessments, our 
knowledge of their understanding would be more accurate.  For the Dual Language program, students are being assessed in 
both Spanish and in English for all content areas. This will show their progress in their home language and identify areas of 
strength and growth. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

For each subgroup, we have identified an instructional plan for the year 2017-2018. A. School Plan for SIFE – Students with 
Interrupted Formal Education        • Teachers incorporate more visuals into their lessons         • Pacing of lessons is modified to 
meet the students’ individual needs        • Daily use of computers to link language to the content areas        • Students are 
exposed to culture through field experiences, and additional music and art classes        • Students receive the mandated units 
of ENL        • Students participate in Visual Thinking Strategy lessons to improve critical thinking and language skills 
through             discussion of visual images        • Students are offered an opportunity to attend the Title III ELL After School 
Program 
        •  Students are assigned a peer mentor 
B. School Plan for Newcomers 0-3 years          • A newly arrived student is assigned to an adult mentor who acclimates him/her 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

to the school environment          • A buddy student is selected as a peer tutor           • Each student is provided with a welcome 
packet, which includes word cards with visuals          • ENL coordinator contributes to the Monthly Parent Newsletter by 
offering suggestions on how parents can assist their             children          • Students are offered the opportunity to attend the 
After School ELL Program (Wednesdays and Thursdays) to strengthen and enhance content vocabulary, further develop writing 
skills, and integrate technology          • Each student receives the mandated units of ENL          • Electronic talking dictionaries, 
glossaries, native language books, and technology are provided (Elmos, laptops, iPads, and SMART Board)          • Differentiated 
instruction takes place for these students in all content areas based on their needs and strengths in            language acquisition 
and conceptual development C. School Plan for Long-term ELLs with Extension of Services (4-6 years)          • Analyze data and 
identify the causes for long-term status, then provide Academic Intervention Services (AIS) support in            the areas of 
need            • Scaffold instruction to allow students a chance to apply their prior knowledge to improve comprehension           • 
Use content area vocabulary and maintain expectations for students to use it in all four language modalities          • Implement 
Depth of Knowledge questions to develop higher order thinking skills and questions          • Differentiate instruction in all 
content areas           D. Long-term ELLs (completed 6 years)          • Analyze data and identify the causes for long-term status, 
then provide RTI support in the areas of need by targeting            focused  lessons in reading and writing by using graphic 
organizers, paired instruction, small group instruction, and technology         • Administer ongoing assessments by all service 
providers so that educational plans can be continuously modified           to meet the needs of each student. E.  We continue 
supporting our former ELLs for two years after they reach proficiency.  We also ensure that they receive extended time during 
all assessments throughout the year.  In addition, they are offered the opportunity to participate in any available after school 
program.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
        ELLs who have been identified as needing an Individual Education Plan or as a student with special needs will have an 
action plan designed by a team which includes the classroom teacher, the IEP teacher, and the ENL teacher.  These 
instructional plans for students with disabilities will take into account the student’s instructional goals, the language in which 
special education and services are delivered, and their challenges determined by the student’s NYSESLAT or NYSITELL.  ELLs 
with an IEP and ELLs who are also students with disabilities (SWD) receive accomodations as appropriate.  These students are 
not exempt from the NYSESLAT, but may use the test modifications and accommodations as detailed on their IEP when taking 
the test.  ELLs with disabilities will receive the required units of ENL services specified in CR Part 154. The special education 
teacher, the IEP teacher and the ENL teacher will communicate to align instruction to ensure the student’s educational goals 
stated on the IEP are met in the least restrictive environment.  All providers of ELLs use visuals, manipulatives and other 
concrete materials for all content areas. In addition, teachers will differentiate center activities and provide hands-on 
experiences allowing for student choice.  During writing, students will be provided with writing frames (language patterns) and 
paper choice.  Academic vocabulary will be enhanced through instruction strategies such as the use of realia and 
manipulatives.  All assessments will be analyzed by this team and action plans will be revisited to address the student’s next 
steps.  These students will use the Common Core aligned ” Ready Gen” and "Go Math" programs where students will receive 
daily language support and build comprehension skills.  These programs contain technology components to provide additional 
scaffolds. For the Dual Language program, teachers will give each student an iPad to promote engagement and language 
development. ELLs throughout all grades will have access to Brain POP and Brain POP jr. as well as Learning A-Z. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL teacher pulls out and services students in ICT and self-contained Special Education classes for the mandated ENL 
minutes.  All ELL students and Students With Disabilities are offered a chance to participate in our after school programs which 
provides additional support through content lessons while addressing the proficiency needs of the students.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our ELL population is provided with a variety of intervention strategies across all content areas. We have purchased the 
Spanish version of the Go Math curriculum in order to meet the needs of those students who have just arrived to the country 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

or those who still feel more confortable using a text book in their native language.  Teachers offer language development and 
support for Science and Social Studies in the native language when same language grouping if possible.  Throughout the day, 
small group instruction is provided with a focus on student needs.  To further enhance the Social Studies curriculum and 
Science curriculum the visual arts teacher collaborates with the classroom teachers to have art units aligned with those 
content areas. An ELL After School Academy is offered for ELLs in grades K-5. The focus of the academy will be determined 
after analyzing the NYSESLAT data. Programs will provide the students with the opportunity to enhance their prior knowledge 
and strengthen their vocabulary through hands-on visual arts projects and theatrical performances.  The subgroups for the 
after school academy include:  Kindergarten is Entering and Emerging; 1st and 2nd grade is Transitioning and Expanding; 3rd to 
5th is Expanding.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year, we will continue to use our Common Core aligned programs in reading and math. (Literacy: Ready Gen; 
Mathematics: Go Math!). We started using Fundations in grades K-2 for Phonics. In addition, we used the Teachers College 
Writing Program. Common planning sessions are built into our daily schedule to allow collaboration between ENL and 
monolingual teachers on each grade level.  This time allows us to ensure that content area instruction is consistent and 
addresses the needs of our ELL students.  Additionally, the ELL cohort now meets bi-monthly. This helps ENL teachers create an 
action plan each month focusing on creating an eight-week action plan addressing each modality.  This cohort receives a 
variety of professional development sessions on ENL strategies and scaffolding to strengthen their instructional practices. 
Lastly, our Dual Language program will be starting with Wonders for ELA and Go Math in Spanish and in English for math based 
on the recommendation of our partnership with P.S. 123.    In addition, our ENL teachers provide a weekly NYSESLAT 
preparation period for all ELLs.  An eight-week cycle addresses each individual modality and prepares students for the 
upcoming NYSESLAT. In our After-School Academy, we will continue to incorporate the content academic vocabulary. This 
year, we will have the following programs: Sounds in Motion, Preventing Academic Failure (PAF), and Reading Comprehension 
through Content Areas. We will continue to incorporate the Visual Thinking Strategies to strengthen students’ oral and written 
language. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued at this time.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs and they have equitable access to grade level curricula. Supplemental 
programs are as follows:  ELL After School Academy (grades K-5); AIS After School (grades K-5); Chorus (grades 4-5); Spring 
Break Camp; ELA, Math, and Science (grades 2-5); Stem Initiative (grades 4-5); Brooklyn Arts Council (grade 3); City Parks 
(grade 4); Partnership with Suny Geneseo (grade 2); A+ Mobile Solutions (grades K-5); Cookshop (grades K-5); Brooklyn 
Academy Music (grades K-5) and New Victory Theater (grades K-5). At the midpoint and culmination of each program parents 
are invited to participate in a family celebration.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A wide variety of instructional materials are used to support our ELL students.  All classrooms and the ENL Lab are equipped 
with materials to support the development of language acquisition and content skills. ENL classroom libraries include books in 
the student’s native language to support literacy development.  Technology in the classrooms include: a SMART board, iPads, 
lap tops, printers, listening centers, talking dictionaries, and Elmo’s to enhance the presentation of lessons, support student 
learning, and offer multiple entry points. Interactive smart board lessons are developed to engage ELLs across all grades and 
content areas.  Audio books are often used to help support struggling readers and newcomers.  Video cameras will be used to 
enhance ENL listening and speaking strands.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

To provide home language support, our ELL classrooms have age-and-grade appropriate native language libraries, listening 
centers, computers, printers, Elmos and SMART Boards. In the ENL program, instruction is given entirely in English but native 
language support is given to scaffold the students as needed.  Students are also provided with glossaries in their native 
language to help support the content, electronic dictionaries to support writing and comprehension, books in the native

language to support literacy, peers who speak the native language to support second language acquisition, and teachers who 
speak the same native language.  Our school library is equipped with a Bilingual Text Parent Library.  These books will reinforce 
skills learned in school, such as reading aloud with fluency and comprehension.  It is an important tool to keep parents 
involved in their child's education.  The library also houses picture dictionaries and a Wordless Collection to increase the use of 
language when describing characters and events.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Our ELLs receive the required services, resources, and accommodations according to their appropriate age, grade level, 
Fountas & Pinnell reading levels and level of English proficiency.  Students are taught the content areas by their current level 
using multiple entry points, taking into consideration their reading level and English proficiency. The school ensures this is 
done by analyzing and keeping track of all the data and assessments.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not currently share a building at this time. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the beginning of the school year, we hold Parent Orientation for ELLs and Open House. We create a Welcome to School 
folder for new ELLs which includes a map of the school and useful words/phrases to know. They are also assigned a buddy that 
will help them adjust to their new school life. Students who newly enroll throughout the school year are encouraged to 
participate in after school programs, such as ELL Academy. Our librarian also informs parents of the resources available, such 
as Open Hours and the bilingual section. The Parent Coordinator hosts workshops throughout the year to let parents know of 
programs such as Homework Helper. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do not offer language electives at our elementary school.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. The dual language model we will use is the self-contained model. The EPs and the ELLs are integrated 
100% of the instructional day. 
b. Each core content area is taught in English and Spanish. 
c. Each language is separated for instruction by day, as we will be using the alternate day model. In 
addition, the room will be physically divided and color-coded English (blue) and Spanish (red) sections. 
d. Emergent literacy will taught in a sequential model depending on the child's L1 (Spanish for ELLs, and 
English for EPs). 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

 

Professional development and support for school staff (including administrators, teachers, paraprofessionals, the guidance 
counselor, the School Based Support Team, speech therapists, the secretary, occupational/physical therapists, and the Parent 
Coordinator) will be ongoing throughout the school year.  Workshops will be offered periodically during the mandated Monday 
PD sessions and Professional Development days.  Topics for these ELL workshops are as follows:•               What is ENL 
Instruction? – strategies/methodologies (September 11, 2017) 
•               Unpacking the NYSESLAT & Implications for Instruction (September 2017)     •               Analyzing Assessments and our 
ELL Population (NYSITELL/NYSESLAT) (September 2017) 
•               Developing Writing Rubrics (October 2017)•               Implementation of CR Part 154 (November 
2017)•               Helping ELLs Write Across all Content Areas (November 2017)•               Using Technology to Create Interactive 
Lessons to Engage ELLs (November 2017)•               Scaffolding Writing Lessons for ELLs (December 2017) 
•               Distinguishing Language Acquisition  from Learning Disabilities •               Creating Sentence Stems and Language 
Objectives for MATH (January 2018)•               Rigor and Engagement in the Classroom (March 2018) 
•               NYSABE Conference (March 2018) 
•               How to Use Assessments (April 2018) In addition, Our ENL/Bilingual teachers and administrators will attend the 
annual SABE Teacher Institute in the spring of 2018.  They will be afforded the opportunity to participate actively in a wide 
variety of workshops and presentations on best pedagogical practices for bilingual and ENL learners. These teachers will 
turnkey the information they receive at the next vertical cohort meeting as well as their next grade level meeting. 
In addition to all the professional learnings listed above, teachers are afforded the opportunity to attend sessions offered by 
DELLSS and the Brooklyn North Field Support throughout the year. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We provide a minimum of 15% of the required professional learning hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 154.2 to 
address the needs of English language learners. These specific professional learning hours are dedicated to language 
acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating languge and content instruction for 
ELLs.  For all bilingual and ENL teachers, we provide a minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours to 
languge acquisition in alignment with Common Core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs.  They learn to identify the approaches that are 
needed to adapt and modify the units of study so that ELLs can receive rigorous instruction and understand underlying 
concepts of each unit of study.  These modifications include a focus on academic vocabulary, pre-teaching concepts, use of 
visual aids, and small group instruction. An agenda is created for every professional development session as well as a record of 
attendance. For accountability, a binder has been created to keep record of these activities in Ms. Aguinaga's room.  Individual 
teachers also have their own Professional Learning binders to ensure they meet all the mandated hours for maintaining 
certification. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Prior to the first parent teacher conference in November, classroom and ENL teachers schedule individual meetings with all 
parents of ELLs to discuss students progress and language development in all content areas.  Interpretation and translation is 
offered as needed.     

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

P.S. 274 provides support and technical assistance in planning and implementing effective parental involvement activities to 
improve student academic achievement and school performance.Some of the activities our ELL parents are invited to

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maritza Ollivierra, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At P.S. 274 a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is given to each registering parent to determine the 
native language of each enlisting student as well as the primary language spoken at home. We analyze the (RHLA) 
Home Language Report periodically to identify the native languages present in our school each school year. We 
also obtain information from the emergency cards where the parents preferred written and oral language is 
indicated. Based on the findings within this report and emergency cards we are able to identify the specific 
families and languages requesting translation.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78

Oral Preferred  

Percent Oral  

 

 

 

Language  

Analysis of our (RHLA) 
Home Language Report 
shows that 43.1 % of our 
parents require oral 
interpretation and written 
translation of school 
distributed materials in 
the following languages: 
Arabic, 1%; Bengali, less 
than 1%; Haitian-Creole, 
less than 1%,; Spanish, 
41%; Tibetan, less than
