Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement: Riverdale Avenue Middle School provides a rigorous and individualized education that prepares all 
students to be 21 st century thinkers. Our students receive a standards-based school experience that promotes our 
core values of Resilience, Altruism, Academic Mastery and Self-Discipline. We provide strong structures to support 
and educate the whole student. Curriculum is individualized for students to meet diverse needs and address personal 
talents, strengths and preferences. Students explore and learn in a culture of high expectations where teachers, 
administrators, parents and community partners collaborate to ensure the success of each individual student. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
RAMS is in its fifth year and we are at almost at full capacity! We are a small staff of thirteen full-time teachers and a 
full-time Dean of Culture. Each structure, system, partnership and initiative that is put into place at RAMS is 
purposeful in meeting the needs of our teachers, students and families. Having the opportunity to grow with a small 
number of students gives us the unique advantage to individualize the way that we approach educating 6 th, 7 th and 
8 th graders. At RAMS we believe in the importance of educating and supporting the whole child with intensive social 
and emotional structures built into our everyday routine to meet the diverse needs of our students and families. 
Home visits, mental health service referrals, at-risk counseling, mentoring partnerships and collaborative contacts 
with community agencies are all utilized to improve student lives so that they can be focused and present in school 
and make learning their number one priority.  

At RAMS we have Enrichment Clubs (based on the School wide Enrichment Model) that meet for two periods each 
Friday afternoon. These Clubs are created by teachers and selected by students two times per year using surveys. 
Students are able to participate in culinary classes, dance classes, martial arts, African drumming, fashion design, 
cheerleading/step, chess, computer coding, and filmmaking. The curriculum is student-driven and works toward an 
end-product that is shared with the whole school during our Enrichment Club showcases.  

At RAMS each day begins with Advisory. All of our teachers are advisors and work from a curriculum that is created to 
meet student emotional and social needs for 30 minutes each morning. Each month students participate in a 
challenge/ competition and also engage in routines including student-led meeting and independent reading each 
week. Past competitions have included door decorations, creation of snowmen for our Winter Formal and our center 
piece challenge. Our Advisory team hosts a monthly PD to introduce the upcoming month’s themes and activities, 
modeling some for the staff. Surveys are given to advisors to gauge the effectiveness and engagement in Advisory as 
well as student focus groups who meet with Advisory consultants to explain what has worked well and what should 
happen in future months.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a population of special needs students that receive speech while the majority of the IEP students in grades 6 
- 8 are in ICT settings in which they benefit from 2 teachers in their classes and in some cases 1 to 1 paraprofessionals. 
Most students receive counseling whether 1 on 1 or in group by a guidance counselor. Students also receive 
counseling from our CBO (Partnership With Children) and from our Single Shepard counselors. These students receive 
emotional and academic support from all parties mentioned. Students identified as ENL receive both push-in and pull-
out services from our ENL teacher. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In reference to the Framework for great Schools, we made significant progress last year in increasing the support from 
families and the surrounding community for our students by strengthening Parent University and providing our 
families with workshops each month that were selected via survey at the start of the year. Student achievement is 
always central in our work collaborating with one another to find the best methods and most engaging strategies to 
enable student progress. This year we are working with Learning Partners Plus for the third year, to further our ability 
to do intervisitations and bring best practices back to RAMS. We have also established our instructional focus which 
is, "designing coherent instruction that increases student outcomes." This was selected based on the patterns and 
trends we saw as a school and the need to improve component 1e in the Danielson Framework, evidenced in informal 
and formal observations from the 2017-18 school year as well as in student data.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After numerous discussions with the staff, consultants that support our school, our data and our Danielson reports, 
we believe that teachers must design impactful lessons for our students.  

Our Staff believes that students learn best when they are a part of their own learning and have choice and voice in the 
classroom. Thus, this past year, we strengthened practices In each classroom so that students have a clear context for 
learning, including why it is important/understanding the objective. There are timed agendas, opportunities for 
students to work together, and focus questions that enable student discussion and opportunities to learn from one 
another.  

Last year our Generation Ready coach worked with teachers on developing higher level questioning techniques in 
order to engage students in conversation and thinking. He also has modeled for teachers the use of Socratic Seminar 
and Accountable Talk strategies to develop their pedagogy. This year we will continue to use Engage NY as well as 
Teachers College Reading and Writing program. Families have been engaged in how to help their child at home 
through our family workshops with CCLS and have also learned concrete strategies they can put into place to ensure 
students are able to access more complex and rigorous material in the classroom.  

We are still committed to utilizing the full-time ICT model in both Humanities and Mathematics this year for 1 grade 
half of our students (1 ICT class on all grades 6 -8). We will be receiving support from our BFSC as well our district 
office. Teachers will continue to inter-visit colleagues within the building and outside to observe best practices. 

We will again be supported by Cambridge this year to sharpen our review and analysis of student data in both ELA 
and Math in order to improve instruction.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers will design coherent instruction that is challenging, differentiated, have reasonable time 
allocations, and provides higher order thinking opportunities for all students, especially ELLs and Students with 
Disabilities as measured by 3% increase in NYS ELA Exam Test Score

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
RAMS is located in one of the neediest communities in Brooklyn. 97% of our students come from families living below 
the poverty line. We recognize the need to provide social and emotional structures well beyond those of the typical 
middle school. Since the inception of the school, Partnership with Children has been integral in supporting us in this 
difficult area as well as our Single Shepard Guidance Counselor and Social Worker, as well as our Care Team. In 
addition to those structures, we continue to implement additional PBIS structures to support our students. Last year 
we established opportunities for students to have voice and choice through the student government and advisory 
council. Additionally, all students are seen whether on an individual or small group basis. Fina 

 

The purposes of our Lunch Club/School Time activities are manifold: 

● Lunch Time Tutoring creates an effective small group setting where children who need additional academic support 
can be nurtured and encouraged to grow as; students are tutored by the teacher and/or peers; it encourages 
teamwork and interdependence, and fosters entire school community;  

● Boys and Girls Groups focus on building positive peer relationships, encourages positive leadership and 
communication, and overall self-awareness. 

● Peer Mediation trains mediators to peacefully resolve interpersonal conflicts which occur in the school. The 
program engages students in the promotion of positive relationships among the entire student body 

● Student Council/School Store allows elected students to develop leadership skills, promote school spirit, provide a 
forum for student voice, and implement a RAMS school store where fellow students may purchase school related 
items with RAMS Bucks given out by teachers to students who earn the reward. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 The C.A.R.E. Team will implement a multi-faceted approach in identifying "at-risk-students". This will 
result in the identification and delivery of monitored and appropriate services for students thereby resulting in 
improved student attendance, decreased student lateness and fewer teacher referrals for special services as 
measured by multiple data sources--i.e. LRE, attendance reports, sub-group reports, AIS, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The majority of our students perform far below grade level. Last year we made progress in raising student proficiency 
in ELA while we lost some strides in mathematics. This year we will broaden our academic interventions to include 
those students who are closest to achieving proficiency as well as those who are struggling to approach and meet 
standards. We will host after-school tutoring sessions, Saturday School for our higher achieving students to push them 
to proficiency, and small group pull out for the lowest third.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, Teachers will collaboratively look at student work following a protocol with a focus on utilizing data to 
drive instruction which will result in an increase of student outcomes as measured by the results of the NYS ELA and 
Math Exams.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Currently teachers at RAMS have been focusing on the 8 components that are rated in teacher evaluations from the 
Danielson framework and we have engaged in lesson studies and also protocols to observe one another and identify 
areas and ways to improve. We have found through the analysis of the 2018 year-end ratings, that there are a variety 
of components we focus on, but decided to focus on Designing Coherent Instruction. Differentiating for students with 
learning challenges can be improved school-wide and we will continue to focus on components of the Danielson 
Framework that best align to improving the design and delivery of lesson plans.  

FOCUS: Designing Coherent Instruction 

Content activity and assessment  

To what extent are teachers planning lessons based on standards/pacing guides? Is pacing and sequencing 
appropriate? Are the student learning objectives reflective of pacing? Are the learning activities appropriate for all 
students (i.e. including all groups-SWDs, ENL, etc.)? Did the teacher differentiate for all learners and all learning 
styles? Are the materials and resources appropriate? Were the instructional groups based on data and how will the 
teacher make adjustments? Are the instructional strategies used by the teacher suitable to the discipline, and to what 
extent do they promote student agency in the learning of challenging content? Did the teacher intentionally plan for 
engagement opportunities that advance learning? 

 

 

Danielson 
Alignment:  

● 1e-Design of 
Instruction 
  

 

Sources of Evidence: 

● Planning Documents, Observations (the nature of work that students are doing, the quality of 
teacher presentations of content, the nature of student discourse and class discussion) and samples 
of student work. 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

When the school opened in 2013, parent and family involvement was very low and the percentages of participation 
from the phase-out school were 5% and under. There was no functional PTA and no parents on the School leadership 
team that attended regular meetings. We designed a program to increase parents and family involvement so that 
parents would have a voice and offer opportunities for them to learn and be active participants in their child’s 
experience in school. Parent University offers 9 monthly workshops to parents and families based on surveys that are 
filled-out the previous year by parents. Workshops included Common core Learning Standards breakdown and how to 
support leaning at home, eating healthy on a budget, sexuality and adolescents, developmental milestones for 
adolescents, gang awareness and anti-bullying and technology in the home. Currently, parent and family involvement 
has increased and we continue to offer activities/workshops that will increase parent participation with the student. 
Parent University continues to be at the forefront of our activities while the PTA/SLT both continue to assist in getting 
additional parents involved.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the Family, Community Outreach Team will maximize the resources available within the local community 
and the school at large which will result in an increase of parent participation by 10% as measured by the results of the 
NYC Learning Environmental Survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Riverdale Avenue Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Riverdale Avenue Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
MS 668 uses TCRWP to assess our students' early literacy skills.  Information from this assessment allows us to evaluate 
fluency, comprehension, decoding strategies, and word attack skills.  This data is used to assign a student their reading level, 
and to determine next steps that the teacher must take to move each child forward.  This data is also used for grouping 
students for our extended day program.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

Our ESL studnets have not performed at high levels in the ELA test and we are currently giving them additional practice in tests 
taking strategies and increasing reading stamina during Saturday school sessions and after-school tutoring. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
As with all of our students, we seek to understand their characteristics as children and learners so that we can utilize their 
strengths to assist with their weaknesses.  With our ELLs, this understanding comes from informal classroom observations, 
conversations with students and their families, and evaluation of their work.  We also utilize data from the RELC to better 
understand their learning history (SIFE, past test results) and to see if there are major gaps that need to be filled.  Information 
about the socioeconomic status, immigration pattern of the family, and familial support are all qualities that our team 
(principal, teacher, guidance counselor, intervention teachers) use to support our children. 
  
Our baseline assessments including pre/post unit assessments allow us to determine where our ELL students fall.  We 
understand that their learning may initially move at a slower pace as they acquire new vocabulary, adjust to a new culture, and 
learn the structures of our school.  What we look for is progress.  Is the student growing in reading and writing, speaking and 
listening?  Are they establishing friendships within the school setting?  Are they engaged with  cognitively challenging 
instruction?  And, we also compare our ELL students with students of similar backgrounds to see if they are progressing at 
similar rates while receiving the same types of supports. 
  
If we find that our ELL students are not moving at an appropriate pace, we will move to Tier 2 interventions to provide 
supports.  Our ESL instructor will meet with classroom teachers to share appropriate strategies.  Students will be placed in 
AIS,  and given intensive small group push-in instruction from our SETTs teacher instruction if necessary.  Teachers and 
classmates engage in conversations and the sharing of ideas that assist with language development. Teachers use the NYSITELL 
to identify where the student is strong, and utilize those strengths to make connections with the English language.  We provide 
additional scaffolds related to content - immersion into vocabulary, picture/media support, trips, repetition and the breaking 
down of lessons - to assist with grasping new ideas.    
  
Before recommending a student for Tier 3, teachers and the ESL instructor and Principal,  evaluate whether the ESL setting is 
appropriate for this particular student.  Interventions will be evaluated and the team provides the teacher with additional 
research based ideas to address student needs.  If the student continues having difficulty after all these supports have been 
put into place, then a more comprehensive evaluation has to be administered to see if additional services are necessary. 
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We are starting year 3 in the fall of 2015.  Based on their NYSESLAT results, our students are strongest at listening and 
speaking. Reading and writing are two modalities that are areas of greater difficulty for our students.   
In writing, scores range from...   
In reading the majority of scores were in the … range.  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

a.  We have a departmentalized schedule so we will use two organizational models for providing ESL services because 
we do not want our students to miss instruction in the content area.  Therefore, our primary form of ESL instruction is 
focused on push-in during the ELA blocks.  However, depending on student need, children will occasionally be 
provided with pull out services. Our ESL teacher has begun to pull studnets during Advisory three times per week in 
addititon to push-in and other pull-out for beginners.  Classes travel together as a group in a block.  Classes are 
heterogenously grouped.  We have two ICT, two general education and one self contained bridge class. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              At this time, our ESL teacher provides 180 minutes per week to our ESL students.  This time will be delivered 
while the children are in the ELA block and also pull-out during afternoon classes.  ESL students also receive three morning 
sessions during advisory class for 45 minutes each. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Much of the work at RAMS is presented through the mini-lesson model.  Teachers provide 10-15 minute lessons, and 
then students work on assignments in groups and in pairs.  In order to foster comprehension and language development, trips 
and fieldwork play an integral role in our instruction.  Teachers utilize videos, lab work, research on computer and in books to 
support their instruction.  Teachers plan instructional units based on the Common Core Learning Standards.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by conducting an informal interview and 
completing a survey upon arrival at our school. This helps determine if a student's home language is other than English, or a 
native language is other than English. Our school takes advantage of the DOE's telephone translation service to ensure we 
comprehend the student, and may call upon teacher personnel who have a working knowledge of a student's native language 
to assist as necessary. Initial assessments such as the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB-R are administered to help evaluate each 
potential ELL student. Following directions explicitly, and noting on the answer key if the student's native language interfered 
with the completion of the assessments is important in evaluating a student appropriately. Also, if an informal assessment is 
needed to evaluate a student, he/she may use both English and the student's native language to complete the assessment. 
  
All evaluations are currently conducted in English.  However, we have ordered State Exams in other languages should the need 
arise.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

6a. Currently, there are no SIFE students enrolled in our ESL Program.  But if we should have any SIFE students in the future or 
students eligible for ELA testing we would work to assess each student to determine their individual needs. Our plan is to fully 
invest in student needs through intervention measures, After-School Programs and to utilize data to drive instruction for our 
ELL students. 
6b.  Within our ESL Program model newcomer students receive differentiated instruction by providing materials at varied 
ability, interest levels as well as their individual learning style.  Reading materials that address content and delivered along 
with daily scaffolds and levels are some ways to differentiate instruction. Providing lessons at varying levels of complexity or at 
different paces are other ways we offer newcomers ELL students differrentiated instruction. It is also critical that 
newcomers  receive not only a large variety of age level appropriate materials, but plenty of visual and kinestic opportunities 
to supplement instruction. Each newcomer (depending on their level) will be given either 360, 180 or 90 minutes of ESL. The 
students, who are Entering, will receive 360 minutes of ESL, which consists of 180 minutes of freestanding ESL and also 180 
min of integrated ESL/ELA. The students, who are Emerging, will also receive 360 minutes of services, which include at least 90 
minutes of freestanding ESL and 180 minutes of integrated ESL/ELA. Transitioning students will receive 180 minutes of ESL, 
which include at least 90 minutes of integrated ESL/ELA. Expanding students will also receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction, 
which will include 180 minutes of solely integrated ESL/ELA 
6c /d.  At this time, we have no long-term ELLs.   For future students we will continue to provide support  in all four modalities: 
Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Differentiated instruction allows LTE students to have some choice in how they 
demonstrate what they have learned. 
6e.  Our former ELLs will receive the same testing modifications as our ELL students. Our former ELLs will receive 90 minutes of 
integrated ESL/ELA or another content area. We will collaborate with classroom teachers to ensure that the integrated class 
time will focus on areas that provide support for our ELLs so that they ultimately can progress and transition to a regular 
classroom. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We do not currently have any ELL-SWDs.  However, in the future,  the instructional strategies and grade-level materials that 
teachers of ELL-SWDs will use that provide access to academic content and accelerate English language development include 
Multisensory Computers that have text to speech Software Programs for students to read and listen to on a daily basis.  These 
computers give students  one on one assistance with speech translation through the Google Translation Link. Use of an 
Interactive Smartboard will not only reinforce academic concepts, but provide students with a way to cater to their individual 
learning styles and learning modalities.  Many of the technological methods and strategies  can align with students I.E.P. goals 
/ modifications.  Classroom teachers use a variety of instructional techniques, including direct instruction, indirect instruction, 
and experiential learning in order to support students. Using the workshop model, ELL-SWDs are given the opportunity to 
access grade level appropriate content, while independently practicing relevant skills and strategies. Differentiated instruction 
also occurs as a standard part of our instructional day, and students are provided with the opportunity to work with their peers 
and in small groups.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 Our school meets uses the curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the  diverse needs of our ELL-SWD s in 
the least restrictive environment by making sure that all instructional strategies and grade-level materials the ELL teacher uses 
align with the  New York State Common Core Standards.  Scheduling flexibility is demonstrated by the ESL teacher  adjusting 
her schedule to Push-In to a classroom to suppport a students' needs. I.C.T., and general education classrooms were created in 
our school to support all students and their special needs. Educational Assistants (Paras) are provided if mandated by the 
students IEP.  Our curriculum allows students the opportunity to access skills at a variety of different levels, supporting their 
overall development. The flexible nature of these groups acknowledges the times when students make progress and continue 
to move and push them to greater proficiency. This allows us to support ELLs in their least restrictive environment.   In 
addition, the use of leveled libraries, small group instruction (inside and outside the classroom), the use of multiple modalities, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

and daily oppportunities for listening and speaking allow ELLs to read and write at their individual instructional level.  Grouping 
students based on ability, creating Cooperative Learning Groups, and scaffoling instruction are other ways in which we will 
meet the diverse needs of our ELL-SWD's within the least restricitive environment.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The ESL teacher will provide targeted intervention service to students during ELA.  In Math, Science and Social Studies, 
students primarily work in small groups or partnerships.  We have co-teaching models utilized in several of our Math 
classes.  We utilize the inquiry model, using essential questions to guide our students' learning.  Each student participates in 
the Advisory Program every day and goes on an Advisory or Enrichment trip every month.  Struggling students are placed in 
our Extended Day program.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Before we try new programs or improvements, we will consider how the students already are progressing through the current 
programs we are using.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We will utilize the integrated push-in model more frequently than the pull out as we do not want to disrupt the learning day of 
our ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students are offered the opportunity to participate in opportunities that help to develop them into individuals with unique 
interests, passions, and likes. As such, our after school programs seek to develop student’s individual interests. We have 
several clubs including wrestling, cheerleading, arts, ethater, dance, etc. that are available to all students.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials and technology that are used to support ELLs include Individual laptops and videos.  Leveled books 
are available and used to support ELLs.  Reading materials in different genres, non-fiction texts and vocabulary building 
dictionaries are used in content areas.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students who are more comfortable writing in their native language are encouraged to do so.  Books in various languages are 
part of every classroom library.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Required services support and resources correspond with ELL's ages and grade levels by having students grouped according to 
their corresponding age level, and are given the opportunity to collaborate and work with their peers as much as possible. 
Related service providers group students based on both age and ability level, in order to maximize instructional time with 
students. Related service providers also interact with the classroom teachers to further support and check on student’s 
development.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The instructional materials and technology that are used to support ELLs include Individual laptops and videos.  Leveled books 
are available and used to support ELLs.  Reading materials in different genres, non-fiction texts and vocabulary building 
dictionaries are used in content areas.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Activities in Riverdale Avenue Middle School that are provided for newly enrolled ELL students would include a tour of the 
school building and grounds as well as the student's mainstream and ELL classrooms. Meeting with the classroom teacher prior 
to school starting, and ensuring that the student will have a "buddy" to help him/her transition to their new school.  Aslo, 
making time for the Administration to meet the child so they are aware of each new ELL student and help them feel 
welcome.Through the collaboration of teachers, cluster teachers, and the Administration a schedule is submitted for approval 
containing the required instructional minutes for all our ELL's as per the CR Part 154. English Language Learners receive 
between 180 and 360 minutes  every week depending on their levels as determined by the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT.  ELL 
students whose Proficiency level is identified as a Beginner or Intermediate level are scheduled to receive 360 minutes per 
week.  Advanced ELL students receive 180 instructional minutes per week.  The ESL teacher imedidately inputs the student into 
the schedule for the appropriate minutes per week. The ESL teacher works in collaboration with the classroom teachers, the 
Children First Network (Cluster 1), and the administration to ensure that all of our ELLs (newcomers, long-term, and those with 
special needs) receive their mandated ESL minutes per week.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We will offer a Spanish this year during our after school program.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 All staff attends professional development opportunities offered through our network, as well as citywide opportunities.  The 
office staff works with the ESL teacher in order to develop a welcoming atmosphere for all families. Staff attended network 
offered UDL training, during the summer, and have continued throughout the school year, in order to better plan and prepare 
lessons for all students. 
Everyone at Riverdale Avenue Middle School supports all our ELL students.  The administration, Paras, Guidance Counselor and 
Special and Regular Education teachers involve themselves in network professional development seminars as well as PD 
options through DELLSS to complete the 7.5 hours of ELL training as per Jose P.  We attend 6 network meetings that focus on 
methodoloties and training on topics such as differentiated strategies and academic language development.  In addition, our 
certified ESL teacher will be providing ongoing professional development on how to support ELLs in the mainstream classroom 
as well as turnkey information at Inquiry meetings and Common Planning groups. At every meeting an Agenda and sign in 
sheet is available for all those who attend. 
 Our certified ESL teacher will  attend Professional Development through the Child First Network 102.  We also take advantage 
of professional development offered by DELLSS and the  UFT / BETACI that include topics such as The Common Core Standards 
and What you need to know about RTI and the English Language Learner.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 In the upcoming year, we are going to be a fully functional 6-8 school.  Therefore, we will encourage parents and students to 
attend high school visits, inform all parents about high school fairs, and have our guidance staff take families to schools during 
the school day.  We have currently planned visits to NYC college campuses so that students understand what their futures will 
hold and understand the steps needed for higher education. 
  
In order to foster collaboration between our classroom teachers and our ENL teacher,  the professional development 
conferences we sign our teachers up for are dedicated to language acquisition and a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies and how to better integrate language and content instruction for ELLs. Our ENL teacher also attends professional 
development that speaks to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction. We also send our ENL 
teacher to conferences that may focus on co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs so 
that they can be properly supported within the content area instruction. The school secretary registers all teachers for the 
professional workshops and these are recorded in a Black Binder in the Main Office .  In addition, there are agendas and sign-in 
sheets that have to be provided at the conference itself and also copied for the school secretary so that a current log of PD 
hours can be properly kept.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents are involved with the school from the beginning of the school year when they attend our orientation meeting and are 
offerd the different options available for ELL services. Throughout the year the staff communicates with ELL parents in their 
native language through informational packets and home mailings. A translator is present when there is an IEP meeting or 
whenever a parent has a question. We have taken advantage of the telephone translation services for Parent Teacher 
Conferences and other parent meetings. Parent Teacher Conferences (2x a year); extended day goals for students (3x a year) 
Aris parent website. The Riverdale Avenue Middle School promotes workshops for parents on the common core State 
Standards as well. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We encourage all our ELL parents to come to meetings and discuss issues and school events. This allows for our parents to 
work together and speak to issues that may only relate to their children. This also allows for parents to foster better 
relationships with our teachers so that we can promote student progress and figure out the best ways to ensure student 
success.   
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
As a school, we are aware that we need to offer a bilingual program if there are 15 or more students on one to two grade levels 
who speak a common language other than English. If we have a drastic increase in our ELL population in the coming years, we will 
begin to explore that option.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kiersten Ward, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
