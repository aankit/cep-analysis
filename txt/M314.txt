Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Mission: 

Who We Are  

The Muscota New School is a small, progressive, K-5 school where a safe, nurturing environment serves as the 
background for a rich academic program based on the core principles of progressive pedagogy. A caring staff of 
diverse, committed educators dedicated to progressive educational practices helps students reflect, develop 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

understandings, make connections and become active participants in their own learning through project-based 
learning. Students learn from each other as they question, observe, collaborate, discuss and share.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As part of our commitment to progressive pedagogy, the Muscota community fosters respect for independent and 
critical thinking, social action and an ever-expanding curiosity about the world and its people. We believe education is 
a joint venture among students, parents and teachers. At Muscota, because creative expression is central to 
progressive education, we understand the critical role the arts play in the development of the whole child. Therefore, 
music, visual art, dance and drama are an integral part of everyday life. 

 

At Muscota New School, fostering a diverse school community has been a core value since our founding. As a school 
of choice, we are committed to making sure that our school reflects the District 6 community, and not just parents 
who seek the alternative, progressive, option.  

To this end, we are participating in the DOE diversity admission pilot to increase the diversity of families in our 
incoming kindergarten class. In the coming 2018/19 school year, students eligible for free or reduced price lunch and 
students in temporary housing will receive priority for 30 percent of 2018-2019 K seats. We consider this to be only 
the first step of shifting our admissions and are actively planning to enhance this pool and consider other options by 
which we can better meet the needs of our district in the next 2-3 years. 

Muscota currently has an active Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, comprised of parents and school 
leadership. The committee has tasked itself with engaging more families in this work as a central part of our learning 
community; making space for families of color within Muscota’s PA and other parent leadership spaces; discussing 
needs around curriculum, student experience, and pedagogy; supporting school efforts to diversify admissions and 
teaching staff; and setting goals over the next 1-3 change to enact change at Muscota.  

Muscota has a teacher team charged with analyzing schoolwide data through an equity lens and developing a long-
term PD plan that is based on the data analysis to increase equitable outcomes. We are a Showcase School for our work 
around social and emotional learning, and are building on this foundation to  

Muscota is a NYC Showcase School for our work around social and emotional learning. We are building on this work to 
strengthen our culturally responsive teaching practices and pedagogy. Muscota staff is engaging in implicit bias 
training, and using the social justice learning standards to identify gaps in curriculum. The standards provide a 
common language and an organizational structure to guide our curriculum revision. Within this daily structure, some 
units are being strengthened along the way, some units need additional resources and materials, and some units will 
be revised entirely.. Some of the resources for revision and strengthening our units are Teaching Tolerance, 
Rethinking Schools, Facing History, NYC Teach, Teaching for Change, and other DEI-focused organizations. 

 

Through surveys provided to families and students, we as a school determined that many of our students were less 
likely to identify internal beliefs, such as students believing they can have an impact on their own learning. Instead, 
these students were more likely to attribute success to luck or other unknown variables and did not identify the the 
real causes of their academic success, such as learning, effort and studying. In the past year we were able to 
implement many student designed projects and allowed for more choice, however, we did not have the systems and 
structures in our school to help student engage in self-reflection and ownership of these projects during conferences.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

While our school has always held family conferences, many parents have identified that they have felt unprepared or 
uninformed to participate in these conferences. They were not sure how they should use exams and projects from 
school to help support their child at home. Our parent community has identified a need to provide more resources 
and tools to help engage them during conferences.  

Overall, we would like to: 

  Encourage students to take responsibility and ownership for their learning by involving them in the goal-

setting and assessment process. 

  Engage families in richer, more transparent conversations about student progress. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Muscota New School has 18% of its students with special needs. Although the needs vary, many students have 
sensory integration issues and present on the autism spectrum.  

 

Muscota has 8% students who are learning English as a new language. Although the majority of students' first 
language is Spanish, we have ENL students who speak Russian, Hebrew, and Chinese. 

 

Strategies and Interventions for English as a New Language Learners and Students with Disabilities: 

Support charts with question prompts 
Small group instruction 
Support charts with conversation tools and habits 

 
 
 
  Push in RTI 
  UDL (Universal Design for Learning) strategies 
  Academic Intervention Service team will support high need subgroups by using research-based programs, 

such as Fundations, Leveled Literacy Intervention and Go Math! Intervention, to target instructional needs. 

  The administration supports intervention by developing schedules, providing professional development, and 
leading conversations that address students with disabilities, English-language learners, and students at risk. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Supportive Environment 

Through our Responsive Classroom curriculum, we create safe, joyful and challenging learning environments where all 
students feel valued and respected. Our students work collaboratively and feel comfortable taking academic risks. 
Children spend two years with the same teacher for kindergarten and first grade. In second grade they transition with 
a teacher for a single year solidifying the early language, literacy, and math skills needed to transition to the middle 
childhood grades while engaging in rich, thematic project-based learning that integrates science and social studies. In 
the middle childhood grades, students spend third and fourth grade with one teacher. Finally, as Muscota students 
prepare for middle school, they spend their last year with a fifth grade teacher. Class loops (k/1 and 3/4) provide a 
unique experience for both the children and the teachers. The children have the continuity of the teacher, the 
classmates and the learning environment. For the teachers, the two-year loop enables a deep and careful approach to 
the curriculum and content areas. With the time to get to know each student, the teacher has a solid grasp of how 
each student learns and how to best help each child make the most growth and progress. During the second and fifth

grade years, students and teachers work collaboratively with families to target specific strengths and weaknesses in 
order to set goals for mastery to allow a successful transition into the middle grades and later, to middle school. 

Time is set aside in classrooms for students to participate in academic choice time activities. Students choose, plan, 
connect, create and reflect on the work they do in these activities in relation to the larger classroom, grade or school 
unit of study. 

 

Another unique feature of Muscota is its commitment to providing opportunities for the school community to come 
together. In addition to Town Meeting and school-wide celebratory events, students play and eat lunch together in k-
2 and 3-5 groupings. Additionally, mentoring activities and mixed age groupings enable students to learn from one 
another in interesting and dynamic ways. Students are given opportunities to collaborate by interest, not by grade or 
class. 

 

Rigorous Instruction 

An academic program with thematic units of study steeped in social studies, science and real world experiences is also 
special feature of Muscota New School. Teachers, administrators and staff collaborate in planning rich and robust 
curriculum units where content areas are interwoven. The essential skills of reading well, writing clearly, studying 
effectively, reasoning soundly and questioning thoughtfully are approached with multiple modalities and entry points 
so that every student’s learning style is considered. Students are given choice in designing and planning projects that 
deepen their understanding of topics and that reflect their mastery of concepts and skills. 

 

Muscota partners with CUNY to provide students with extended learning time and additional learning opportunities. 
CUNY provides homework support, physical activity and opportunities for socialization. 

 

Challenges 

Muscota New School occupies one and a half floors of the Haywood Burns Building. We share our space with Amistad 
Dual Language School. Sharing facilities including the gym, cafeteria, library, school yard and auditorium can require 
creative problem solving as we fulfill our program under operational constraints. Much time is required for both 
schools to navigate the planning of events and activities throughout the building. Additionally, with every part of our 
portion of the building utilized to the maximum usage, finding break-out space for small groups to work is a particular 
challenge. Since the use of space dictates the schedule and our priority is to ensure that all students receive a robust 
arts education and physical education, grade level teachers do not share common preps 

 

Key Area of Focus:  

 

Implementing structures for inter visitations and reciprocal peer mentoring that supports teacher 
collaboration and equitable outcomes. 

  building consistent practices that continually allow students to own their own learning including student led 

conferences, student self assessment strategies and peer assessment techniques. 
  Engage families in richer, more transparent conversations about student progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Strengths: Rigorous instruction 

  At Muscota New School curriculum is organized into four interdisciplinary units of study that emphasize 

authentic learning experiences and that engage students in 21st-century skills. In each project, our students 
go beyond the textbook to study complex topics based on real-world issues, such as exploring the creation of 
civilizations to recreating the Amazon Rainforest, analyzing information from multiple sources, including the 
Internet and interviews with experts. Students utilize original documents and data, mastering principles 
covered in traditional courses but learning them in more meaningful ways. Working together on project 
teams and guided by trained teachers, students learn the skills of collaborating, managing emotions, and 
resolving conflicts in groups. Each member of the team is responsible for learning the subject matter as well 
as helping their peers to learn. 

 

  During these projects students are able to solve highly complex problems requires that students have both 

fundamental skills (reading, writing, and math) and 21st century skills (teamwork, problem solving, research 
gathering, time management, information synthesizing, utilizing high tech tools). With this combination of 
skills, students become directors and managers of their learning process, guided and mentored by a skilled 
teacher. 

  More than 25% of SWD and ENL perform at levels 3 and 4 on state assessments. 
  Area of celebration on the QR is 3.4 establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations 

to staff, students and families and provides supports to achieve those expectations.= 

Priority: 

  Throughout the school day we are having our students direct their learning process, however, students are 
not an active part of the assessment or reflection process. At times, students are not always clear on their 
individual goals and next steps they need to take in order to improve their work.  

  We have high expectations for academic rigor in our school. We have implemented school-wide structures in 
order to promote opportunities and supports for students to engage in student led projects. Our faculty has 
been able to engage students in projects but have identified the need to ensure there are more opportunities 
for students to explain their learning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

  We have identified the need to implement more systems and structures in our school for students to take 

accountability over their own learning.  

  As a school we have been able to review our assessments and implement standards based assessments, but 
we were looking for ways to report student growth and development on a higher level. When we moved to 
consistent standardized based instruction conferences were sometimes guided by test scores or reading 
assessment. By implementing portfolios in which students gather, share, and reflect on their work with 
parents and teachers, and by implementing student-led conferences where students are the center of the 
communication between teachers and parents.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of students will set goals and monitor their mastery of CCLS through self- assessment as evidenced 
by 80% of students reaching grade level benchmarks on TC writing rubric.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: 

As we begin to support our students towards acquiring 21st century skills, at Muscota we have acknowledged the 
need for skilled teachers who are able to address academic and social concerns of their students. Throughout our 
school, teachers implement responsive classroom pedagogy in order to create a safe school community. It is through 
this program that our students have been able to develop self-control, begin to understand what socially responsible 
behavior is, and come to value such behavior. At Muscota we apply educational research that explores culturally 
responsive and relevant teaching, developing a shared understanding that young children learn best in an interactive, 
relational mode rather than through an education model that focuses on rote instruction. Integration of current brain 
research into teaching strategies supports positive learning outcomes for all children, where children’s strengths are 
nurtured and used to connect them to new knowledge, and their culture and home languages are recognized as 
essential elements of learning. 

 

Our school was selected by Showcase schools in order to serve as a model for other schools throughout New York 
city. According to the 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, 96% of parents feel that the principal works to create a 
sense of community in the school. 100% of teachers say that students are safe in the building. 100% of teachers say 
that adults at the school teach students how to advocate for themselves. 100% of teachers say that students feel it is 
important to come to school every day. On the 2016-17 Quality Review, our school received a well developed on 
component 1.4, maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal 
growth of students and adults. 

 

Priority: 

According to the 2016-2017 Quality Review, it was identified that most teachers do not provide specific feedback to 
challenge our most advanced learner as indicated MOTP component 3d. Our classrooms have a safe environment that 
engages all students, but we still need to improve the quality of our feedback. Our school needs to use our feedback 
structures to lift students to high levels of content mastery, provoke critical thinking and deep analysis, and coach 
students into becoming strong readers and writers.  

In reviewing our school-wide routines and structures for student feedback, teachers have identified the work of 
providing detailed, constructive and individual feedback to students on their first assignment, so that they could 
revise and improve their work for the second assignment, created a large gap in time for students. Whilst the 
provision of extensive feedback this past year has been pivotal to the students’ learning and improvement in skills, 
and the importance of the feedback was acknowledged by the students, it became increasingly challenging for the

teachers to sustain this workload, and have students continue to effectively improve their work. As a result, students 
had difficulty implementing feedback until the next conference with their teacher.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

94% of teachers say they have opportunities to work productively with colleagues in their school. 

100% of teachers say that they work together to design instructional programs. 100% of teachers say that they feel 
responsible that all students learn. The Quality Review indicated that teachers meet regularly using student work 
protocols to inform instruction and shift practice. 96% gave positive responses on the school environment survey for 
Collaborative teachers.  

Monday professional development time is devoted to continuous collaborative planning among general, special 
education and service provider to ensure we are appropriately meeting the unique needs and varying abilities of our 
students with special needs. Teachers have structures in place to norm and use student work protocols. 

 

Priorities: 

During our professional development cycle, used the book Leaders of their Own Learning in order to better 
understand the student led conferences and student self-assessment in the classroom. Teachers had a number of 
opportunities for professional development in a formal setting frequently throughout the calendar year to understand 
self-assessment, but teachers identified that they wanted to have more opportunities to view how self-assessment 
was implemented throughout the school. In order to help ensure that practices around self-assessment and student 
led conferences are consistent, teachers would like to spend more time visiting colleagues to improve on our 
implementation of self-assessment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on parent feedback, we have identified that a need is to provide parents with practical tools, workshops, and 
training incorporates strategies and resources conducive to helping them support their children’s academic growth on 
the Common Core State Standards and prepare for family conferences. Educators have traditionally viewed parent-
teacher conferences in one of two ways: sporadic opportunities to involve parents in their child’s learning or dreary 
formalities required when a child’s behavior or performance has been less than satisfactory. 

Family conferences are an integral portion of our school model, so it is pivotal that parents’ are able to participate in a 
way that allows all parties to actively reflect on their child’s academic performance. Collaboration between parents, 
teachers, and the student is critical, and leads to a student’s success in the classroom. Parents have expressed that 
they would like to hear more about a students’ individual characteristics, such as learning style, strengths, interests. 
Teachers have also expressed a desire to work on a plan for students that will involve ongoing collaboration among all 
three parties. There is a need for workshops and additional structures to help create a meaningful conferences for all 
three parties.

  Hiring committees are formed when a vacancy occurs. Committees consist of administration, staff, and 

parents to ensure all facets of the school community are represented. Interviews are used to introduce the 
candidate to the school, our rigorous student expectations and our progressive values. Teaching 
demonstrations are scheduled for the committee to observe and recommendations for new hires are made 
by the group following a discussion of the candidates and what traits make each candidate a good match for 
our school 

  Teachers are provided with opportunities for meaningful professional development and training in their 

cohort and across grades and subject areas. 

  Teachers visit each other's classrooms to observe teaching methods, receive and provide peer constructive 

feedback, and improve instruction 

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Four of our teachers attended the Teacher Leadership Program through the Department of Education. They received 
specific training on facilitation skills. The teacher leaders consult with administration to develop a professional 
development plan and lead their cohort meetings. We go deep on a topic for a 6 week inquiry cycle. We end each 
cycle with implementing a new strategy, inter-visitations, feedback and reflection. There is time spent on looking at 
student work and adjusting instruction based on the data to ensure that we meet the needs of all students. At the 
beginning of each school year our first cycle of inquiry is always around Responsive Classroom, our social and 
emotional program. We spend the first six weeks creating classroom communities that are nurturing, supportive and 
collaborative where children feel safe to take academic risks.

school professional development plan. Muscota also has a PD committee that works closely with administration to 
support teachers using assessment data to improve instruction and student outcomes. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Parent Involvement Policy  
Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student 
achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective 
involvement of parents and community in the school. Muscota School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through 
school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, 
and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Muscota New School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

Assessments.Structure 2:The Muscota ENL Teacher and the Classroom Teacher identify instructional goals based on the New 
Language Arts Progressions.Structure 3:The Muscota ENL Teacher, the Classroom Teacher, the Special Education Teachers 
meet to identify which ELLs need Tier 2 or Tier 3 instruction.Structure 4:The Muscota New School Village Meetings, which 
include the classroom teacher, ENL teacher, student, parents/guardians, and Special Education teacher (as needed), will be 
held the 3rd and 4th weeks in September and in January to discuss progress on instructional goals, social-emotional goals, and 
family/home goals. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The Muscota New School uses data to guide instruction for ELLs using the RTI Multi-tier Service Delivery Model:STEP 1. The 
ELLs' classroom teacher, ENL teacher, and Special Education teacher (as needed) analyze the following data at the beginning of 
the year:a. F&P Reading Recordb. Fundations Assessmentc. NYSITELL for incoming K studentsd. NYSESLATe. K-2 Math MOSLf. 
3-5 ELA MOSLg. ENL Subgroup (Newcomer, Developing, Long-Term, FELLs, SIFE) 
h. L1 and L2 literacy  
i. Bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has received intervention in Tier 1, 2, and 3. 
j.  Instructional goals and IEP Goals when applicable 
STEP 2. The Intervention Model is created using the following features:-a. size of instructional group-b. frequency and content 
of formative and summative assessment-c. duration of the intervention-d. frequency of instruction-e. teacher with 
qualifications that match the student's needsOur RTI Program consists of the following components according to each 
Tier:TIER 1:  At the beginning of each school year, the ENL Team creates a schedule to insure our ELLs are receiving their 
required number of minutes according to CR Part 154.2.The ENL teacher works with the classroom teachers of all K-5 ELLs to 
insure 4 methods of scaffolded instruction within each of the 4 Common Core aligned interdisciplinary units of study.  ELL 
scaffolds are insured as follows:  1. Differentiated tasks and texts2. Researched-based SIOP Model strategies including:--
building background---Ready Gen, Fontas & Pinnell, Focused Reading: Reading Intervention program, and Fundations 
strategies to develop vocabulary, language (grammar), phonics, and comprehension skills---listening, and speaking objectives 
for each lesson---repetition, rephrasing, and teacher modified rate of instructional speech---wait time---realia, pictures, video, 
and audio---total physical response---graphic organizers for vocabuarly development and content comprehension---sentence 
starters and discussion protocols for thinking, listening, speaking, reading, and writing3. Teacher-Student and Student-Student 
Communication (Danielson's Domain 3a)---Goal sheets indicating the New Language Arts Language Progression objectives for 
that 8-week instructional cycle.---Weekly teacher and peer conferences to guage mastery and identify next steps by using 
checks for understanding corresponding to each goal.---Daily self-reflection by using  checks for understanding for students to 
identify what support they need from the teacher or their peers 4. Questioning and Discussion Techniques (Danielson's 
Domain 3b).---Questions are based on the 4 levels of questioning according to the Depth of Knowledge continuum.---Lessons 
include CCSS for Speaking and Listening aligned to student run discussion protocols including but not limited to: Text Structure

language prompts, Frayer Model vocabulary organizer (2-5) and word web (K-1), Thinking Maps and discussion protocols from 
the book, "Making Thinking Visible" (e.g. Concept Map, and Chart Chat).5. Village Meeting:---The student's parents, the 
student, ENL teacher, classroom teacher, special education liaison, and other service providers share academic and social 
emotional goals, and identify family/home goals.TIER II:ELLs who are identified through our universal, school-wide asessment 
measure, Fontas and Pinnell, as being in the lowest scoring 15-20% of their grade receive Tier 2 instruction as follows:   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
OUTCOME ASSESSMENT DATA USED TO EVALUATE AND INFORM OUR ELL PROGRAM:1. 2018 NYSITELL & NYSESLAT Listening, 
Speaking, Reading, and Writing scoresA.Kindergarten NYSITELL: 1 scored Commanding, 4 scored Expanding (Advanced), 3 
scored Transitioning (Intermediate), and 1 scored Emerging (Low Intermediate).B.  1st Grade: 2 scored Commanding, 1 scored 
Expanding and 1 scored Emerging. Both students who did not score Commanding, scored low in Speaking and Writing, i.e. 
language production.C.  2nd Grade: 1 scored Expanding and 2 scored Transitioning. All students scored low in Writing.D.  3rd 
Grade:  3 scored Expanding with low scores in Writing, and 1 scored Emerging with low scores in Listening, Reading, and 
Writing.E.  4th Grade:  1 scored Commanding because he scored a Level 3 on the ELA and Expanding on the NYSESLAT. The 
other 4th Grade student scored Expanding with low scores in Listening and Writing.2. 2018 ELA and Math (TO BE 
ADDED)A. ELA: one ELL scored a Level 3 and the other scored a Level 1. B. MATH: one ELL scored a Level 3 and the other 
scored a Level 2.PROGRAMMING DECISIONS: 
 
TO BE ADDED -BASED ON NYESLAT AND NYSITELL LEVELS IN L,S,R,W 
Based on the above data, Stand Alone ENL will only be provided for Beginning (NYSITELL), Entering and Emerging (NYSESLAT) 
students in grades K-2. 
 
KINDERGARTEN-FIFTH GRADES: TRANSITIONING AND EXPANDING LEVELSProvide Integrated ENL/ELA for grades K-5. All groups 
will contain mixed proficiency levels to provide language models and language practice for listening and speaking as well as 
reading and writing. However, we only have one ELL in 5th Grade. Since she is reading on the same level as 3 of the 5 fourth 
grade ELLs, she will be placed in their Integrated ENL group. 
 
Instruction will focus on listening and speaking and vocabulary development. Students will be discussion and responding to 
literature orally and in writing. Students will develop their reading and writing skills to help them complete New Language Arts 
Progressions objectives for each of the 3 interdisciplinary units of study. 
 
KINDERGARTEN - SECOND GRADES: ENTERING AND EMERGING LEVELS 
Provide Stand Alone ENL/Math for Entering and Emerging Kindergarten, First and Second Grade ELLs.  Students will develop 
listening and speaking and language skills while building Tier 3 math vocabulary. By focusing instruction on listening, speaking 
and language and vocabulary development, students will develop their computational and problem solving skills. The 
instructional focus will help students develop their thinking skills which will transfer to the listening, speaking, reading and 
writing skills needed for writing responses in ELA (narrative, informational and opinion) and in Math (word problems and short 
and extended response). Instruction will also help students meet the New Language Arts Progressions objectives while 
learning how to solve 1-2 step word problems to meet the CCSS Standards in Math for Operations and Algebraic Thinking. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Structure 1:At the end of the year, the Muscota ENL Team, (the Special Education liaison and teacher, biligual education 
teacher, general education teacher, and the ENL teacher) meets to discuss the projected outcome assessments as well as the 
current formative and summative asessments of our ELLs. The team meets again at the beginning of the year to compare the 
projected and actual scores of the outcome assessments.Structure 2:At the end of the year, the ENL Team holds an end of the 
year meeting with the principal and AP to discuss the projected outcome assessments, formative assessments, and summative 
assessments. The ENL Team presents the proposal for programming, grouping, scheduling, and teacher co-planning 
time.Structure 3:At the beginning of the year, the ENL teacher meets with all teachers of ELLs to discuss the programming, 
grouping, scheduling, and teacher co-planning time. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

STANDALONE ENL: 
1a.    Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 180 minutes (4 periods) of standalone ENL as follows:1b.   Kindergarten, 1st 
and 2nd Grade ELLs travel to the Intervention/ENL classroom.1c.   The students meet in 3-5 groups for 45 minutes, 4 
periods per week.1d.   Students are grouped based on their grade level, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT Listening and 
Speaking Levels. 
INTEGRATED ENL/ELA:2a.    Entering , Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes (4 periods) of 
integrated ENL as follows:2b. Kindergarten ELLs travel to one of the Kindergarten classroom. 
2c. First Grade ELLs travel to one of the 1st Grade classrooms.2d. 2nd Grade ELLs travel to one of the 2nd Grade 
classrooms. 2e. 3rd Grade ELLs travel to one of the 3rd Grade classrooms. 
2f. 4th and 5th Grade ELLs travel to the 4th Grade classroom.2g. Each group in 2b-2f meets for 45 mintues, 4 periods 
per week.2h. Students are group based on their grade level, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT Listening and Speaking Levels, 
NYS ELA and Math exam scores, and MOSL.3. Commanding students receive 90 minutes (2 periods) of OPTION SMALL 
GROUP LEARNING.3a. Commanding students in 2nd and 5th Grades will work in small groups with 45 mintues, 2 
periods per week.3b. Commanding students are grouped based on their grade level, NYS ELA exam, MOSL, and 
Fountas and Pinnell reading level. 
3c. Progress monitoring will be administered at the beginning of November and the end of January to determine 
whether or not the students need to be scheduled for Integrated ENL for the remainder of the year.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

The TBE program is not applicable because Muscota does not have 15 students who share a common home language 
across two contiguous grades. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

The DL program is not applicable because Muscota does not have 50% of students who want to learn a new language 
and 50% of students whose families want their child educated in their home language.             

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
The school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in our ENL 
program by employing the following structures:STRUCTURE 1:At the end of the year, in order to begin planning for the 
following school year, the ENL Teacher creates tentative ENL groups and a schedule for these groups that meets their required 
number of Standalone and Integrated ENL minutes according to CR 154.2.  This is done by looking at the speaking and writing 
scores and making an estimated projection of the NYSESLAT score for each ELL.STRUCTURE 2:In August, the ENL Teacher 
meets with the Assistant Principal and Pirincipal to review the RLAT report from ATS to identify the students proficiency levels. 
Next, they review the ENL Units of Study and Staffing Requirements from CR Part 154.2. Using the proficiency levels and this 
chart, they make revisions to the groups and schedule for the ELLs in the ENL program.EXPLICIT ENL, ELA, and HLA

INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES:STANDALONE ENL:1.    Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 180 minutes (4 periods) of standalone 
ENL as follows: 
1a.   Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd Grade ELLs travel to the Intervention/ENL classroom. 
1b.   The students meet in 3-5 groups for 45 minutes, 4 periods per week. 
1c.   Students are grouped based on their grade level, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT Listening and Speaking Levels. 
 
INTEGRATED ENL/ELA: 
2a.    Entering , Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes (4 periods) of integrated ENL as follows: 
2b. Kindergarten ELLs travel to one of the Kindergarten classroom. 
2c. First Grade ELLs travel to one of the 1st Grade classrooms. 
2d. 2nd Grade ELLs travel to one of the 2nd Grade classrooms. 
2e. 3rd Grade ELLs travel to one of the 3rd Grade classrooms. 
2f. 4th and 5th Grade ELLs travel to the 4th Grade classroom. 
2g. Each group in 2b-2f meets for 45 mintues, 4 periods per week. 
2h. Students are group based on their grade level, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT Listening and Speaking Levels, NYS ELA and Math 
exam scores, and MOSL. 
 
3. Commanding students receive 90 minutes (2 periods) of OPTION SMALL GROUP LEARNING. 
3a. Commanding students in 2nd and 5th Grades will work in small groups with 45 mintues, 2 periods per week. 
3b. Commanding students are grouped based on their grade level, NYS ELA exam, MOSL, and Fountas and Pinnell reading 
level. 
3c. Progress monitoring will be administered at the beginning of November and the end of January to determine whether or 
not the students need to be scheduled for Integrated ENL for the remainder of the year. 
  
HLA: 
In order to provide HLA for students with a different home language at our school, and in order to meet the required 
instructional time for HLA, which is 25% of the total ENL minutes required for each proficiency level, the Muscota New School 
has created the following HLA Program for our diverse needs: 
---Students will be provided with online books in their home languages which include: Japanese, Polish, and Spanish. 
---At the beginning, middle, and end of the year, during the project time for our interdisciplinary units of study, peers will 
evaluate one another using a teacher created rubric that evaluates vocabulary development in the home langauge based on 
CCSS Language Standard 6. To present this work, students in Grades K-1 will use Word Webs to acquire new vocabulary in 
their native language and students in Grades 2-5 will use the Frayer Model vocabulary format in their notebooks to acquire 
new vocabulary in their native language.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
1. ENL PROGRAM - CORE CONTENT 
Instruction is delivered in English. When necessary, the ENL Teacher and Classroom Teachers, who are fluent in Spanish, 
provide academic and socio-emotional guidance. If an ELL does not speak Spanish and needs support during instruction, the 
ENL teacher coordinates a bilingual peer or a parent volunteer who is bilingual in the student's language to provide academic 
support as needed.2. INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES TO MAKE CONTENT COMPREHENSIBLE TO FOSTER LANGUAGE 
DEVELOPMENT AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE COMMON CORE LEARNING STANDARDS:A. Differentiated tasks and texts

project time for our interdisciplinary units of study, peers will evaluate one another using a teacher created rubric that 
evaluates vocabulary development in the home langauge based on CCSS Language Standard 6 and  listening and speaking 
development in the home language based on CCSS Listening and Speaking Standard 4 for Presentation of Knowledge and 
Ideas.

SIFE: 1. DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION - ICT & SETSS PROGRAMMINGSIFE students will be assigned to a classroom housing ICT 
and SETSS Programming so that they may receive instruction in a classroom with two teachers. In the past we have noticed our 
Long Term ELLs have improved their proficiency level on the NYSESLAT after working in a classroom with one General 
Education and one Special Education teacher.  Therefore, we will provide this type of placement so SIFE students receive 
consistent and targeted small group instruction.NEWCOMER1. DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION - Heterogenous Grouping in 
Integrated ENL with native English students ON grade level.During Newcomer ELLs' integrated ENL period, Newcomers will be 
heterogeneously grouped with native English speaking students performing ON grade level in this subject area. This type of 
grouping ensures ELLs develop strong literacy skills.  Instruction will include Questioning and Discussion Techniques 
(Danielson's Domain 3b):---Questions are based on the 4 levels of questioning according to the Depth of Knowledge 
continuum.---Lessons include CCSS for Speaking and Listening aligned to student run discussion protocols including but not 
limited to: Text Structure language prompts, Frayer Model vocabulary organizer (2-5) and word web (K-1), Thinking Maps and

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use small group instruction to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language 
development. In a class with ICT and SETSS Programming, ELL-SWDs are grouped hetereogenously by language proficiency and 
homogeneously by academic skill level. Additionally, teachers of ELL-SWDs provide longer wait time, pair and group work, 
Total Physical Response, use of manipulatives and realia, choral repetition, moderately paced speech, language prompts, 
questioning and discussion strategies using checks for understanding throughout each of the 3 interdisciplinary units of 
study.        
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  
1. CURRICULAR & INSTRUCTIONAL FELXIBILITY:Multi-sensory access to content through field trips, class projects, center 
activities, Muscota's music, dance, physical education, drama and art program; and Movement-based learning through Move 
to Improve and Brain Gym.  
 
2. SCHEDULING FLEXIBILITY:ELL-SWDs have access to the least restrictive environment in classes 
with ICT and SETSS Programming where there is one certified Special Education teacher and one certified General Education 
teacher.  In addition, ELL-SWDs are given one extra period each week for Integrated ENL/ELA service during the time their 
respective class is engaged in small group instruction. This ensures ELL-SWDs do not miss instructional time in their classroom. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Lastly, the Special Education Teacher, PT, OT, and Speech service providers work together with the ENL teacher to coordinate 
their schedules to insure ELL-SWDs are receiving the necessary instruction to meet their IEP goals and attain English 
proficiency.        
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ALL SUBGROUPS:---Targeted Intervention Programs for math - All ELLs receive daily instruction in the Go Math program taught 
by the classroom teacher (K-3) and ENL teacher (4-5).  This is a school-wide program.  At the beginning of each chapter of this 
program there is a "Show What You Know" diagnostic assessment.  The intervention for each chapter is based on the data 
from this assessment.  The program indicates one of the following types of intervention required: Soar to Success Math (online 
component), Strategic Intervention or Intensive Intervention. Therefore our ELLs receive math intervention per chapter within 
this program.DEVELOPING, LONG-TERM, AND FELLS:---The above Math intervention will be supplemented for these ELLS by 
using the Benchmark Company's Math Explorers Leveled Texts.---2 of the 4 Standalone ENL periods for Developing, Long-Term, 
and Former ELLs will be taught using the researched based Focused Reading Intervention Program. This will be taugh by the 
ENL Teacher in English with language support in Spanish. If a child does not speak Spanish, the parent coordinator and ENL 
teacher will find a school or parent volunteer who speaks that child’s language to support the ENL teacher’s instruction.---2 of 
the 4 Integrated ENL periods for Developing, Long-Term, and Former ELLs in each of the 3 interdisciplinary units of study will 
be supplemented by the Benchmark Company's English Explorers Leveled Texts for Science and Social Studies.  
---2 of the 4 Integrated ENL periods for Developing, Long-Term, and Former ELLs in each of the 3 interdisciplinary units of study 
will be supplemented by the Benchmark Company's English Explorers Leveled Texts for Science and Social Studies.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2 IMPROVEMENTS for the 2017-2019 School Years:1. Integrated ENL will focus on the CCSS Language and Listening & Speaking 
Standards to ensure ELLs develop a strong L2 literacy foundation to improve reading and writing skills. (2017-2018)2. 
Resources and literacy development of the Home Language (2017-2018)3. Heterogenous grouping in Integrated ENL, Math, 
ELA, Science, and Social Studies with native speakers who are on or above grade level in those subject areas. (2017-2018) 
4. Common prep period for the ENL and Classroom teachers to analyze student work and monitor student progress every 8 
weeks. (2018-2019)    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not have a bilingual program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All the ELL students at PS 314 are ensured a placement in all school programs, and we do not require pre-requisites for these 
programs: 
1. Chess Club 
2. Guitar Club 
3. CUNY in the Heights 
4. Math Tutoring 
5. Bard Drama Club 
In June, the ENL teacher works with the Parent Coordinator to identify parents who prefer to receive school communication in 
their home language. This allows our school to ensure that all communication regarding our after school programs is sent in 
the parent's preferred language.      
  
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

The instructional materials used to support all ELLs include: 
1. lap tops 
2. iPads 
3. Smart and Promethean Boards 
4. academic videos 
5. listening centers 
6. math manipulatives 
7. FOSS science kits 
8. kinesthetic movements reference poster and cards (Brain Gym® and Move to Improve) to support language learning, and 
the acquisition of comprehension skills, organizational skills and communication skills.  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ENL - ALL SUBGROUPS 
HLA: 
In order to provide HLA for students with a different home language at our school, and in order to meet the required 
instructional time for HLA, which is 25% of the total ENL minutes required for each proficiency level, the Muscota New School 
has created the following HLA Program for our diverse needs: 
---Students will be provided with online books in their home languages which include: Japanese, Polish, and Spanish. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

At the beginning of the year, a meeting is held with the ENL Team, the Classroom Teachers of ELLs, the K-2 Literacy Coach, 
Special Education Teacher/Liaison, and Assistant Principal.  During this meeting the following ELL student data is reviewed: 
birth date and class placement, outcome assessment data, summative assessment data, and the Muscota Language Allocation 
Policy to ensure all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  
   
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Muscota shares a building with Amistad Dual Language school. The Principal and AP of each school meets once each year to 
discuss sharing the school yard, cafeteria, library, gym, and art room.  This ensures that all ELLs have access to books in English 
and Spanish, art program materials, and time for physical and social-emotional development during gym, recess and lunch.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
1) During June the ENL teacher and the Classroom Teachers attend the Muscota Family Orientation for incoming students. The 
students go in to their new classrooms and families and students meet the teachers. 2) The second week in September parents 
of ELLs meet with the ENL teacher and Classroom Teacher to discuss the goals and components of the ENL program, and 
exchange contact information. 3) While The Muscota New School has 99% enrollment of new ELLs in Kindergarten, we offer an 
additional Muscota Family Orientation as needed throughout the year. During this orientation, the ENL Teacher and respective 
classroom teacher attend the orientation.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered to ELLs.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable because we do not have a DL Program. 
  
     
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2018

1) Improving Literacy Development Part 1: Setting Targeted Reading Goals in Small Groups 
2) Improving Literacy Development Part 2: Delivering Targeted Reading Instruction in Small Groups 
3) Improving Literacy Development Part 3: Formative and Summative Assessments in Small Groups 
4)Village Meetings: Sharing Academic and Social-emotional Responsibilities with ELL Families 
  
50% OF TOTAL HOURS FOR BILINGUAL/ENL TEACHERS: 
175 professional development hours are required every 5 years. So that equates to 35 hours each year. Fifty percent of 35 
hours is 17.5 hours. The following workshops equate to over 50% of the required hours. 
1) The ENL and Bilingual teachers attend 4 District ELL Meetings for 3 hours each 
2) The ENL and Bilingual teachers attend monthly, full-day, ENL Lead Teacher meetings. 
3) The ENL and Bilingual teachers will attend 2, full-day DELLs workshops. 
 HOW ARE RECORDS KEPT? 
The ENL Teacher keeps a PD Binder corresponding to the respective school year with the following documents from each PD: 
1. Agenda 
2. Attendance 
3. Resources 
4. Meeting/Workshop Notes 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 
VILLAGE MEETINGS 
Village Meetings are held at the beginning of the year to discuss initial goals, then at the end of each of the 4 Interdisciplinary 
Units of Study. During these meetings, the student's parents, the student, the ENL teacher, the classroom teacher, the special 
education liaison and other service providers ( if the student has an IEP) determine and revise academic and social-emotional 
goals and family/home goals. 
 
Following are the goals that are discussed in the meeting: 
1. Program Goal 1: Academic Goal - Parents are given the students academic level according to the grade level standard the 
child is meeting. Then parent's are shown the a sample of grade-level student word for the child's current grade level. This is 
done to educate the parents as to where the child lies on the New Language Arts Progressions for the standards addressed in 
the current Unit of Study, which include: Listening and Speaking, Language, Reading, Writing, and Math.  
 
2. Program Goal 2: Social-Emotional Goal - The teachers share anecdotes that capture three areas: 
1. the student's ability to maintain their attention and focus on their work. 
2. the student's participation as a community member in the class. 
3. the student's ability to ask for help when he/she needs it. 
 
3. Program Goal 3: Family/Home Goal - The parents/guardians and student share a goal related to developing healthy habits to 
support academic and social-emotional development. Typically, the areas that are discussed are: sleeping habits, diet, 
homework routines, and family chores. 
 
Muscota teachers do their best to accommodate our families by meeting at a time that works for their schedule. However, 
when parents are unable to meet, all the child's teachers and providers correspond with parents via a conference call. 
Regardless of the manner in which the Village Meeting is held, interpretation is always provided in the language identified on 
the family's Preferred Language form. 
 
To ensure the parents and teachers have a record of what was discussed as well as next steps, an email or letter is sent home 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

 

to the child's family and all team members so that the information can be accessed as needed.  In addition, a copy of the email 
or letter is kept in the Family Tab of the ELL Binder for the corresponding year. 
 
 
INTERPRETATION AND TRANSLATION 
In June, the ENL teacher works with the Parent Coordinator to identify parents who prefer to receive school communication in 
their home language. This allows them to ensure that all communication regarding our day and after school programs is sent in 
the parent's preferred language.      

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

MUSCOTA CULTURE CLUB 
Each family chooses a cultural activity to share with their child's class. 
  
COMPONENTS: 
1. Pizza Party Planning: In September at the ENL Program Family Orientation, parents of ELLs meet with the ENL teacher to 
choose a cultural activity they want to share with their child's class.  Parents can collaborate with other parents.  
2. Language: The cultural activity will be conducted by the parent in their home language. 
3. Activity: Parents will share one aspect of their respective culture by reading aloud a book, singing a song, doing a craft 
activity, or playing a game in the family's respective home language or in English - depending on the family member's language 
preference. 
 
COFFEE WITH CAMILLE 
Coffee with Camille is a monthly forum where all Muscota parents meet with the principal to voice their questions, concerns, 
or ideas. At each meeting an interpreter is provided. In addition, the ENL Teacher insures a personal invitation is sent text 
message to remind and encourage all ENL parents to attend and take advantage of this opportunity to voice their needs at the 
upcoming meeting. As always, the ENL teacher communicates with all parents in their preferred language as indicated on their 
preferred language form.   
 
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
 
Village Meetings: 
We would like to share that the Village Meetings were implemented in 2015-2016.  The ENL and Classroom teachers noticed that 
ELL students had different needs than non-ELL students.  In particular, teachers felt that student progress needed to be reviewed 
every 6-8 weeks.  Teachers also noticed the need for a collaboration among teacher, parent, and student. Therefore, in the spirit of 
the proverb, "It takes a village to raise a child," the progress monitoring and goal setting meetings were named, "Village 
Meetings."  In each meeting, all members of the "village" take time to set goals pertaining to academics, social-emotional skills, and 
home life.  It has been a pleasure to watch ELLs progress unfold as a result of clear goal setting in low-performing subjects, home 
life habits including earlier bed times, chores with reward systems, exercise and diet.  As a result of these meetings teachers, 
families, and students work very diligently throughout the year to make progress.  Furthermore, there is a bond that is formed 
throughout the year as families and teachers and students communicate on a regular basis through email, phone calls, and text 
messages that are exchanged in between Village Meetings. It has been wonderful to watch all three parties (students, families and 
teachers) get the support they need.  Therefore, we are pleased to continue incorporating the Village Meetings into our ELL 
Program since it provides an opportunity to set manageable goals that meet the  needs of the child in a holistic way through 
collaboration of child, parents/guardians, and teachers.  
 
The Muscota Culture Club: 
Our Culture Club is a new program initiative that has two goals. The first goal is to provide all ENL families with an opportunity to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

partake in their child's education by sharing their culture and home language with our entire school community. At Muscota we 
encourage families to visit and volunteer in their child's classroom. However, some ELL Families are not always able to visit or 
volunteer, sometimes due to the fact that they speak a language other than English. Therefore, the Culture Club provides them 
with an opportunity to get involved even though they cannot speak English. A second goal of the Culture Club is to celebrate all 
cultures at Muscota even if the student is not in the ELL program. As a result, we invite all families who wish to share their home 
culture and home language with their child's classmates. 
 
Ultimately, we hope to build a multicultural community in our classrooms that is representative of our multicultural community in 
New York City. The Muscota Culture Club is our way of beginning to break the language barrier and embrace what we have in 
common so we can learn, grow and live together with greater joy and ease.  
 
As with all initiatives, current and new, we make sure to revise them based on student achievement and interest, and teacher and 
parent feedback.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Camille Wallin, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In Part III: Parent Information, on the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) parents indicate their preferred 
language in which they would like to receive written information and communicate orally with school staff. In 
addition, during the intake process, parents fill out the Parent's Preferred Language form that asks parents to 
indicate their preferred language of communication with school staff. In addition, this year we have begun to label 
Emergency Contact cards with the family's preferred language of communication, the list of staff members who 
speak the language of the family, and the phone number for the Translation and Interpretation Unit in the event 
there are no staff members who speak the family's language.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

At our school's Famiy Night (Back to School/Curriculum Night) in September, parents will be provided with the 
following documents from the Translation and Interpretation Unit:  

-Welcome Poster  

-Parents' Bill of Rights  

-Parents' Guide to Language Access  

As explained above in Part D, our school will post the Language ID Guide at our main office and security desk.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our LAC will provide our Parent Association with a list of families whose preferred language is a language other than 
English, indicating that they require translation and interpretation services. With the assistance of our bilingual class 
parents or the Translation and Interpretation Unit, our Parent Association will then contact these families to inquire as 
to whether or not they are receiving school information in their home language, and as to whether or not they are 
attending school events and parent-teacher conferences with the assistance of an interpreter.
