Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of our school is to prepare the leaders of tomorrow by building a nested community of learners where 
every participant is fully engaged in document-based questions, performance oriented tasks, accountable talk, 
scientific research strategies and inquiry-based skills; as well as creating a nurturing learning environment via sound 
instructional practices, shared consent and differentiated learning. Additionally, we will empower children to become 
self-sufficient and responsible. At P.S. /I.S. 208Q, we will create lifelong learners and children who are proficient in the 
art of Sciences and the Science of the Arts.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S./I.S. 208 is a random selection school. It is a combined elementary and intermediate school with 730 students 
from Kindergarten through Grade 8. This school is located in the Bellerose section of Queens, New York. This K to 8 
School opened in September, 2003 with approximately 650 students from culturally diverse backgrounds. The school 
population attracted students from all sections of District 29: Hollis, St. Albans, Cambria Heights, Laurelton, Rosedale, 
Jamaica, Queens Village and Springfield Gardens. The students in grades K-5 were randomly selected by a lottery 
process that took place in February and the students in grades 6-8 were selected through middle school choice. 

The average attendance rate for both students and teachers for the school year 2015/2016 was 96.0%. P.S./I.S. 208’s 
ethnic make-up is the following: 77% Black; 11% Hispanic; 2%, White, 9% Asian students and other 1%. The student 
body includes 2% English language learners and 19 % special education students. Male performance in ELA and Math 
is lower than that of their female peers. 

 

 

P.S./I.S. 208 is a kaleidoscope of cultures that values partnerships. The school strives to provide a seamless approach 
to enhancing the opportunities and creativity of the teachers. Teachers play an integral role in the learning process. 
They really make a difference in the learning that takes place in the lives of our children. We share a common interest 
in guiding our students to successfully meet the performance standards. 

As we develop the whole child physically, socially, intellectually, emotionally and academically, P.S./I.S. 208 holds 
everyone to a very high standard of performance and achievement in order to attain academic success. We are 
committed to fostering good parent-teacher, parent-administrator, and student-teacher participation. Our intention 
is to utilize all resources to develop standards-based, performance-driven educational programs to enhance daily 
instruction. Our belief is that we need to build on children’s prior knowledge, cultivate and nurture their energies and 
the spirit they bring to our learning environment, in order to meet the requirements for college and career readiness. 
Our focus is clear, coherent and consistent. We set high performance goals for all: 

“We Educate the Whole Child” 

In reviewing the educational program of P.S. /I.S. 208, analyzing the reports generated by the Quality Review, and 
assessing the performance standards of our children in all core subjects, we have identified the following strengths, 
challenges and accomplishments: 

School’s Strengths 

The school is organized in nested communities of learners where everyone is engaged in professional learning 
communities to research and analyze new strategies that are aligned with a refined and progressive pedagogy that 
will lead to college and career readiness for every child. To ensure adherence to rigorous teaching and learning, the 
school has provided the following support: 

● Teachers and students use a variety of software such as: School Net, LearnZillion, Destination Reading, 
and authentic assessments to gather information about what students know and what they can do in fine 
details to monitor performance and progress. 
● All teaching staff members were trained in differentiating instruction. 
● Teachers provide regular feedback to students in order for them to increase their performance and 
progress. 
● Administration provides feedback on a regular basis to teachers in order for them to improve their 
pedagogy and to increase the rigor in their classrooms to ensure high levels of student engagement.

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on teacher created summative assessments and benchmark assessments for the school year 2016/2017, grade 
wide midterms and finals, our special needs students need to show more growth in ELA and Math. We will review the 
data generated by the School Quality Snapshot, analyze results from our QR to determine the performance trends in 
ELA and Math. Also we will conduct analysis of the progress of all students, especially those in the lowest-third from 
the School Quality Guide Report to close the achievement gap. 
 

● Curriculum Planning 
● Looking at Student Work 
● Professional Development 
● Formative Assessment 
● Teacher Created Assessments 
● Frequent Classroom Visit/Inter visitations/Feedback 
● Peer to Peer Mentoring and Tutoring

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. I.S 208, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

I.S 208 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use the following assessment tools at PS 208Q:  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB, Kindergarten People, Ready Gen 
Performance Based Unit Assessments, MOSL Performance Based Assessment, Go Math, Schoolnet, Destination Math, Raz 
KIds,  Go Math Digital and informal assessments by classroom teachers. Newly arrived ELLs have difficulty reading and 
understanding English  so we work on them reaching benchmarks for variety of skills from phonemic awareness to reading 
comprehension. The greatest need seems to be reading comprehension and writing in grades 2,3,4,5 and 6.  In kindergarten 
the greatest need is phonemic awareness and sight vocabulary. They are provided with additional time if needed.   This 
information will drive instruction. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The goal of the formative assessment is for us to monitor student learning and to provide continuous feedback that we can 
use to improve learning. Through these formative assessment  we can identify strengths and weaknesses and target areas that 
need support.  In order to support this effort of analyzing student assessments,the ESL teacher meets with classroom teachers 
to discuss NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores.  The scores are analyzed with classroom teachers and we develop plans and 
strategies in order to set language goals for our ELLs.  The NYSITELL is administered based on Home Language Surveys 
and student/parent interviews.    The NYSESLAT is given every April/May to all current ELLs in the school during the testing 
period.  The Spanish LAB is administered after the NYSITELL only to ELLs whose home language is Spanish. if they do not test 
proficient on the NYSITELL.  Teacher created assessments and unit tests are administered multiple times through the school 
year to determine growth and areas where support is needed.  We develop plans and strategies and then evaluate and modify 
based on student needs.  Weekly meetings are scheduled to articulate with classroom teachers on what progress has been 
made and what supports are needed.  Teacher gathers evidence through interaction with students or observations of tasks 
and activities.  Also feedback to students is a crucial component. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Each year administration and the ESL teacher reviews the ELL data. Each grade uses the NYC Performance Tasks in order to 
support planning and guide instruction.We look for patterns and trends that may need to be addressed.  We  develop and 
follow programs that meet the needs of our students and allow us to differentiate in order to meet each child's individual 
needs.  We collaborate with classroom teachers and meet with administration in an effort to ensure that each student is 
receiving the highest level of education in order to meet or exceed the Common Core Standards.  Success is measured as per 
our ELLs gains on both formal and informal assessments.  Year after year, we are noting our ELLs progress on their 
NYSESLAT.  We also monitor student growth by developing student portfolios in ESL to showcase their work samples and 
progress.  Tests, assignments and projects are used to determine whether students have learned what they are expected to 
learn. 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ESL teacher runs ATS reports: EDAT, RLAT, RLER, RNMR, RESI, RMSR .  Trends are shared with the Principal, AP, classroom 
teachers and inquiry team members.  Based on the reports, we plan for struggling learners in order to place them 
appropriately in RTI, Wilson Reading, Reading Recovery,and  AIS. Title 3 Summer School is offered to ELLs.  We give PD to 
teachers and identify problems of practice with possible solutions.  We give tools to students to build independence based on 
data.  NYSESLAT scores are shared with administration and teachers. We analyze all data for each student ot recognize 
strengths and weakness across all four modalities: speaking, reading, listening and writing. These results are shared with 
administration, teachers and parents. Student data results are reviewed and the teacher is able to identify students' strengths 
and weaknesses and target areas that need intervention. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We identify ELLs who are not making academic progress at expected rates. Beyond screening and identification for ENL 
services, the students receive targeted instructional support to bolster development in below benchmark area. This support is 
delivered with language support services. We adapt, modify, supplement, and develop effective curriculum. We analyze 
student work samples and behaviors to determine the nature of the problems. We also analyze teaching style, expectations 
and perceptions, classroom management, and take into account cultural diversity. RtI uses tiers of intervention for struggling 
ELLs.  We monitor students to determine if they are progressing as they should academically.  In Tiers I and II general 
education teachers provide instruction and interventions.  Only after ELLs fail to respond to small group and intense individual 
interventions, they  are referred to special education.  We involve special education teachers to help develop interventions 
and plan assessments for students receiving instruction and interventions in Tiers I and II.  They do not provide instruction 
until Tier III, when the student could be referred and identified for special education.  We make sure the students' difficulties 
are the result of a disability and not second language acquisition. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use RLAT, RLER, and EDAT to  look at data from NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments. 
In analyzing the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data, the following patterns were found: 
     - All five levels (entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, commanding) students scored highest in speaking modality. 
     - We found that most of our ELLs need support in reading and writing due to the shifts in Common Core State Standards.  
     - Listening modality is also a challenging area for our ELLs across all five levels of proficiency. 
The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data continues to drive instruction. 
The inquiry team constantly analyzes NYS ELA and NYS Math score in the beginning of the school year and as the school year 
progresses in order to identify strengths and needs in specific skills and strategies.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The inquiry team creates cycles to target ELA and math to address the needs of our students.  The information is disseminated 
to administration, classroom teachers and out of classroom teachers on an ongoing basis.  We focus on skills students need 
assistance with according to NYS ELA and Math test data, in addition to unit tests and teacher created tests.  We use 
NYSESLAT data in order to maximize effective instruction for our ELLs.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  At PS 208Q, ESL instruction is delivered in both a push in(where numbers allow) and pull-out model.  ESL classes are 
formed based on the English Language Learners current grade and English language ability. The ESL teacher, both 
licensed and state certified in ESL, provides our ELLs with all instruction in English.   
   Students are grouped heterogeneously by need and grade level in our push in and pull-out ESL instructional 
program. When possible, the ESL push in is during the literacy block so comprehension is maximized.  English 
Language Learners are receiving the New York State mandated ENL/ELA allotted instruction time based on student 
proficiency levels based on individual NYSITELL and NYSESLAT testing data.  Entering and emerging level ELLs will be 
receiving 360 minutes of ENL instruction weekly (180 mins Stand-Alone ENL, 180 mins Integrated ENL.) Transitioning 
level ELLs will be receiving 180 minutes of ENL (90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Integrated 
ENL or Stand-Alone ENL. Expanding level ELLs receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. 
Commanding level (proficient ELLs) will receiving 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area per week, 
per Part 154 for 2 years after they pass NYSESLAT. Planning arrangements between ESL and classroom teachers take 
place during common preps and grade meetings.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

           

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

           

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

           Students are grouped heterogeneously by need and grade level in our push in and pull-out ESL instructional program. 
When possible, the ESL push in is during the literacy block so comprehension is maximized.  English Language Learners are 
receiving the New York State mandated ENL/ELA allotted instruction time based on student proficiency levels based on 
individual NYSITELL and NYSESLAT testing data.  Entering and emerging level ELLs are receiving 360 minutes of ENL instruction 
weekly (180 mins Stand-Alone ENL, 180 mins Integrated ENL.) Transitioning level ELLs are receiving 180 minutes of ENL (90 
minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of either Integrated ENL or Stand-Alone ENL. Expanding level ELLs receive 180 
minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. Commanding level (proficient ELLs) are receiving 90 minutes of 
Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area per week, per Part 154. Planning arrangements between ESL and classroom teachers 
take place during common preps and grade meetings.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The ESL program is taught in English. In order to make content areas comprehensible we tap into prior knowledge, give 
individual support, scaffold and differentiate content, and have collaborative learning.  Lessons in content areas are designed 
to meet standards while we differentiate instruction to meet student needs.  Strategies we implement when addressing the 
language demands of teaching content to our ELLs are: teaching Tier II and III vocabulary, visuals, building background 
knowledge, promoting language development through cooperative learning groups, and using native language support .  
Based upon the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, the following strategies and practices are used for all our 
ELLs (less than three years, and 4 to 6 years- and long term ELLs): Tier II and III vocabulary work, journal writing, drama, poetry, 
chanting, singing, choral speaking, computer word processing, book making, reader’s theater, cooking and puppetry.  All 
instruction is delivered in English.  Reading, writing and mathematics skills are reinforced with special attention given to the 
conventions of grammar and usage.  Real-life experiences are provided to increase and encourage the use of English 
vocabulary.  Cooperative learning groups, paired learning, thematic units, Word Walls, graphic organizers, Total Physical 
Response, teacher modeling and trips are all part of instruction.   Scaffolding techniques are always used to facilitate and 
enhance learning while making the content and language instruction comprehensible for English Language Learners.  The 
following scaffolding strategies are implemented in order to support students' understanding of the academic curriculum: 
Modeling when introducing a new task, learners need to see or hear what a developed product looks like; Bridging activities 
access prior knowledge to establish the basis for new information.  This includes brainstorming, anticipatory charts and 
identifying related literature and experiences; Contextualization which refers to putting words in context in order to convey 
meaning of unfamiliar words using visuals, manipulatives, graphic organizers, and other realia services; Schema building which 
involves bringing to light the connections that exist between and across concepts and the curriculum.  Strategies such as 
graphic organizers, story mapping, jigsaw, etc… help students gain a wider understanding of how concepts fit together; 
Metacognitive development involves the explicit teaching and learning of strategies that enable students to become 
autonomous learners ; such as thinking maps, KWL activities, think alouds, and reading with a focus; Text representation which 
involves taking a known text and changing it for a new purpose using a different genre such as dramatizations, storyboards and 
post cards.  In addition, cooperative learning strategies are very useful in helping English Language Learners improve their 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.  Additional strategies used to facilitate language acquisition are predictable and 
consistent classroom routines, aided diagrams, lists, and easy to read schedules on the board or on charts to which the teacher 
refers frequently.  Also employed is additional time and opportunities for practice, emphasizing vocabulary development by 
identifying and clarifying difficult words and passages within texts in order to facilitate comprehension, summarizing and 
paraphrasing text, and always targeting both content and English language objectives. 
  
Though English Language Learners are grouped according to both English proficiency and grade, differentiated groups are 
formed within each class in order to further meet the needs of individual students.  ELLs are continually monitored both 
formally (tests) and informally (observations). Among our more formal assessments are Ready Gen Performance Based 
Assessment,MOSL Performance Based Assessment and informal assessments.   The data from each assessment is gathered by 
the teachers and shared with the ESL teachers.  The teachers meet on a continuous basis to analyze the data and determine 
the proper skills/lessons to be taught.  Students are taught in strategy and guided groups according to their individual levels of 
proficiency in each skill area addressed.  Furthermore, English Language Learners are given additional support when necessary 
in ELA, math and other content areas through the use of intervention programs such as Wilson Reading Systems (grades 1-5), 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

Reading Recovery, At Risk SETSS , RtI, and ESL summer school. Bilingual dictionaries and Ipads to support comprehension are 
used. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELLs are given the opportunity to take the NYSED in translated versions, if necessary. ELLs who are administered the NYSITELL 
and whose home language is Spanish, are administered the Spanish LAB if they do not test proficient on the NSITELL.. We use 
the results of the Spanish LAB to determine their fluency in Spanish. For newcomer ELLs, we administer the SIFE Oral Interview 
Questions with the help of bilingual staff members.  For low incidence languages, we contact consultants to translate NYS 
Math and  Social Studies tests. Bilingual staff are involved with ELLs who need assistance. Native language books, dictionaries, 
and glossaries are available. In addition, computer software is used to differentiate instruction and facilitate language 
acquisition. Our ESL teacher meets with the classroom teachers and together they continually discuss and plan instruction for 
our ELLs in order to ensure cohesion across the school day and in every content area.Writing samples in the native language is 
used to determine native language and content knowledge.Native language is incorporated into English instruction as a 
support to clarify, build prior knowledge, extend comprehension and bridge experiences. 
This is done through technology, thinking maps, bilingual staff, peers, native language materials and flexible groups. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We differentiate instruction for all of our English Language Learners.   
     a.  We currently do not have any SIFE students.  In the event that we do have SIFE students, we will address each student's 
individual needs.  In addition, we  differentiate instruction, focus on students' strengths,  and provide RtI. Lessons in content 
areas are designed to meet standards while we differentiate instruction to meet student needs.  Strategies we implement 
when addressing the language demands of teaching content to our ELLs are: teaching Tier II and III vocabulary, use of 
computers visuals,activating prior knowledge, building background knowledge, promoting language development through 
cooperative learning groups, and using native language support .They have access to computer program My On,Think Central 
and Dream Box. Students are provided an IPad to facilitate and support language acquisition. 
     b.  Our newcomers are continually assessed and closely monitored throughout the school year.  Based on the students' 
needs, and abilities, they are given ESL support towards English proficiency as well as meeting the curriculum needs of their 
grade.  All newcomers receive their mandated 360 minutes of ESL instruction each week in order to support their efforts 
towards success. We also ensure that ESL testing modifications are in place at the time of the standardized exam as well as all 
exams in preparation for the NYS ELA. They have access to computer programs purchased such as Myon, Think Central and 
Dream Box.  Peer tutoring is also available if needed and lessons in content areas are designed to meet standards while we 
differentiate instruction to meet student needs.  Strategies we implement when addressing the language demands of teaching 
content to our ELLs are: teaching Tier II and III vocabulary, visuals, building background knowledge, promoting language 
development through cooperative learning groups, and using native language support . We differentiate lessons as necessary 
to fit the need of our newcomer ELLs including the use of thinking maps,picture supports,and TPR.  Newcomers are provided 
with IPad in order to support language acquisition. 
     c.  Our plan for ELLs receiving service for 4 to 6 years is once again to follow their required instructional ESL time each 
week.  As we do with our newcomers, we continually assess their English proficiency as well as the curriculum needs in their 
grade and use this data to drive our instruction and create a safe and effective educational atmosphere for them.  As stated 
above, guidance, bilingual glossaries, bilingual libraries and peer tutoring are available when necessary. Lessons in content 
areas are designed to meet standards while we differentiate instruction to meet student needs.  Strategies we implement 
when addressing the language demands of teaching content to our ELLs are: teaching Tier II and III vocabulary, visuals, building

strengths and provide him with needed support in reading and writing. Strategies we implement when addressing the 
language demands of teaching content to our ELLs are: teaching Tier II and III vocabulary, visuals, building background 
knowledge, promoting language development through cooperative learning groups, and using native language support . We 
provide them with IPads. 
     e.  Former ELLs are provided 90 minutes per week of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. In addition, they are given 
testing accommodations (time extension, separate location, translated glossaries,…) Also, they have opportunity to use 
computer programs such as My On, Think Central and Dream Box. They also may get counseling and RTI if necessary. They 
have access to computers, Ipad, all technology and translated dictionaries. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Strategies we use for ELL SWD  to access content area and accelerate English language development are:  tapping into prior 
knowledge, meaningful and standards based language use across curriculum at student's instructional level,  collaborative 
learning, teaching Tier II and Tier III vocabulary, and scaffolding and differentiation. We adapt lessons in order to maximize 
each student's potential, with a focus on their IEP goals and needs. Materials  used are Ready Gen, Envision Math, Avenues ESL 
books, Raz Kids, Go Math Digital, Smartboard, computers, bilingual books , bilingual dictionaries, tapping into prior knowledge, 
graphic organizers, thinking maps,  manipulatives, and visuals.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ELL SWD curriculum and instruction is presented in multiple ways and allow for diverse avenues of expression.  Technology 
, tapping into prior knowledge, meaningful and standards based language use across curriculum at student's instructional level, 
individual support, scaffolding and differentiation  are all strategies we use to ensure access to general education curriculum 
and Common Core Standards.  We are cognizant of students' strengths and challenges when planning Common Core 
instruction, and focus on IEP goals and needs.  Flexibility in scheduling allows our ELL SWD to remain in general education 
classrooms and have special ed teachers (SETSS and ICT) address their needs based on the goals in the IEP. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All of our students receive differentiated instruction in ELA, math and other content areas.  Our ELLs are no exception.  We 
offer our ELLs individualized instruction targeting their English language needs as well as their curriculum needs towards 
meeting the Common Core Learning Standards.  English Language Learners are given additional support when necessary in 
ELA, math and other content areas through the use of intervention programs such as SETSS, RtI,  and summer school. 
Computers, Ipads, apps, Khan Academy, and other resources are used.  Small group instruction and flexible groupings provide 
further support.  NYS bilingual glossaries are provided in different content areas in order to support each childs' understanding 
of the lesson and materials.These interventions are in English, but if necessary native language is also provided. These 
interventions are in English, but are also provided in native language , if necessary. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Each year we assess the work done in the previous year,and focus our attention to what worked and what needs 
improvement.  This year, we have decided to deepen our work in differentiation with all our students including our ELLS.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs and they participate in all of them.  They have the opportunity to 
participate in our Champs Program, Inquiry Focus group, Saturday Academy,  Boy's Reading Club, Club Activities, Drama Club, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

electives, PTA After School, trips, etc.  There is equity amongst all of our student population.  ELLs are given given the same 
opportunities as the rest of the PS 208Q students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials used in the school are Ready Gen and Go Math.  Many regular classrooms have a Smart Board that is 
used with all of our students including our ELLs.  In addition, we have laptops of which all teachers including our ESL teachers 
have access to. The ESL teacher has  IPads to use with her students. We have leveled libraries available for all of our students 
including our ELLs to check out books on their independent reading levels.  We have hands on tools such manipulatives for use 
in mathematics instruction. In addition, the following materials are used to support the learning of ELLs – computer software 
Schoolnet, Performance Series (reading, math, language arts), Destination Math, My On, Think Central, Dream Box, Raz Kids, 
Reading Rainbowk Go Math Digital,  thesauruses, picture dictionaries (Oxford and Longman) with accompanying CDs, Amazing 
English, Avenues, Imagine, Words Their Way  for word work, vocabulary and writing, guided reading books, Big Books, picture 
books with accompanying audio cassettes, videos with accompanying books, Paired books (fiction and nonfiction about the 
same topic), sentence builder links, classroom library of picture books, chapter books, poetry, science, social studies and math 
books, games and maps. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 ELLs are given the opportunity to express themselves in their native language, when needed.  When incoming ELLs arrive from 
other countries, we try to team them up with students who speak their language or place them in classrooms where there is a 
paraprofessional who speaks their language.  We want our ELLs to feel comfortable and confident in asking questions and 
expressing themselves.  We also have bilingual dictionaries and bilingual libraries available for their use. At PS 208 we have 
respect for and celebrate the linguistic and cultural diversity of students. There is always collaboration between school, home 
and  community. Native language is incorporated into English instruction as a support to clarify, build prior knowledge, extend 
comprehension and bridge experiences. This is done through technology, bilingual staff, peers, native language materials and 
flexible groups.  ELLs are given the opportunity to take the NYS exams in translated versions.  ELLs who are administered the 
NYSITELL and whose home language is Spanish, are given the Spanish LAB if they do not test proficient on the NYSITELL  Se use 
the results of the Spanish LAB to determine their fluency in Spanish.  For SIFE, we administer the SIFE Oral Interview Questions 
with the help of bilingual staff. Computer software is used to differentiate instruction and facilitate language 
acquisition.Writing samples in the native language is used to determine native language and content knowledge.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our English Language Learners are given their required ESL service support in relation to their ages and current grade 
level.  They are given bilingual texts, glossaries and translation services when necesssary.  In addition, instruction is 
differentiated in order to meet each child's individual needs as they strive towards both English proficiency as well as meeting 
their grade's common core curriculum requirements. We place our ELLs in small groups based upon grade levels. We ensure all 
required services are given by appropriate teachers and we enter this information into STARS.   Based on IEP goals and 
recommendations, we plan instruction for our ELLs with disabilites.  Based upon most recent NYSESLAT/NYSITELL score data, 
we plan each ELLs appropriate minutes of service according toCR Part 154. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building or have a co-location.  Instructional materials are shared within our entire school building. We 
share Instructional materials such as  Ready Gen and Go Math.  Many regular classrooms have a Smart Board that is used with 
all of our students including our ELLs.  In addition, we have laptops of which all teachers including our ESL teachers have access 
to. The ESL teacher has an IPad to use with her students. We have leveled libraries available for all of our students including 
our ELLs to check out books on their independent reading levels.  We have hands on tools such manipulatives for use in 
mathematics instruction. In addition, the following materials are used to support the learning of ELLs – computer software 
Schoolnet, Performance Series (reading, math, language arts), Destination Math, My On, Think Central, Dream Box, 
thesauruses, picture dictionaries (Oxford and Longman) with accompanying CDs, Amazing English, Avenues, Imagine, Words 
Their Way  for word work, vocabulary and writing, guided reading books, Big Books, picture books with accompanying audio

classroom library of picture books, chapter books, poetry, science, social studies and math books, games and maps. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We have a PTA summer camp program which ELLs could attend. We give newly enrolled ELL students the opportunity to come 
to our school during the summer and familiarize themselves with PS 208Q.The parent coordinator is involved in these 
activities.  We pair up new ELLs with a buddy, preferably someone who speaks their native language to ease the transition. 
Google Earth is used on Ipad to translate curriculum. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Spanish to all students. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

        N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff development takes place at grade conferences and faculty meetings.  Throughout the school year, our ESL 
teacher attends professional development through our D.29  and OELL. She turnkeys the information to our classroom and 
cluster teachers, sharing pertinent information on working with ELLs in all content areas and ensuring continuity across the ESL 
program and the classroom. She attends training in Common Core and ESL methodologies as well as continuously being 
updated regarding NYSESLAT and LAB-R training and policies.  School secretaries also attend pertinent workshops.  The ESL 
teacher works closely with the secretaries to review all important information.All teachers of ELLs have the opportunity to 
attend relevant ELL workshops 
The ESL teacher attends District 29 meetings and OELL workshops addressing academic rigor and the Common Core Learning 
Standards and this information is presented to classroom and cluster teachers. Any TC ESL workshops, OELL workshops and 
others are available for all teachers to attend.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As our ELLs transition from middle school to  high school, they are given further support from our guidance counselors to 
discuss transitional concerns and feelings.  Staff members continually monitor students and keep the lines of communication 
open with parents should any needs arise.  At the end of each school year, our eighth graders visit their prospective schools in 
order to familiarize them with their new surroundings, ease their transition and lessen their anxiety. 
  
  The ESL teacher conducts professional development activities for the school pedagogical staff during after school 
meetings.  An ESL workshop is planned during the months of September, November,  January , March,, and May  for all staff to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

attend. All ESL teachers attend 50% of the required professional development hours both in school and at out of building 
ESL meetings. Both the congruence meetings and the ESL workshop fulfill the 7.5 hours of ELL training for our staff 
members.  Lesson support and modeling is provided by ESL teachers on an as needed basis.When the ESL teacher pushes 
in,  ESL techniques and strategies to support the Common Core Learning Standards are modeled for the classroom 
teachers.  Teachers keep record of their attendance and pertinent information received during the workshop.  Administration 
keeps copies of all ELL training attendance sheets.  15% of the required professional development hours are dedicated to 
language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction including focus on best practices for teaching strategies 
for ELLs. All PDs are given with an agenda and attendance is recorded.  ESL teachers will attend 50% of required PD hours from 
OELL, TC and through monthly ESL network meetings and any other relevant workshops offered.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At PS 208, Tuesdays after school, during parent communication time, we communicate with parents of ELLs.  We meet 
together with the classroom teacher or content area teachers or speak on the phone. School staff is available for translation, if 
needed.  Goals of the program, their child's progress, analysis of class work and test assessments are addressed. We inform 
parents of what they need to do to help their child. These meetings are in addition to mandated parent teacher conferences. 
At least once a year, we meet individually with parents of ELLs to discuss language development progress and goals of the 
program (with translators).   Individual student records are kept in ESL student portfolios, cumulative folders and parent 
engagement logs.  Bilingual staff are available during parent outreach hours in order to be sure parents understand the 
progress of their child and to address any issues. We also contact Translation and Interpretation Unit, if necessary. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
  At PS 208 we have high parent involvement.  Parents are encouraged to get involved in school activities.  We offer parents 
throughout the year the ability to participate in activities with their children both during the school day and after school . We 
have parent workshops, school trips, food festivals, class activities, shows, museum visits and plays . In addition, they are given 
parent workshops throughout the year to inform them of upcoming assessments and student progress on ELA. Math 
, NYSITELL,/ NYSESLAT, and interim ESL assessments.The Translation and Interpretation Unit is used if necessary.  Parents of 
ELLs are active participants in all of the PS/IS 208 extra curricular parent activities.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, James Philemy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We review part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), generate RHLA and RPOB ATS reports, look 
at student emergency cards, and review Language Information Surveys to determine parents language 
preference. We receive referrals from both teachers and the Parent Coordinator. Our Parent Coordinator also 
surveys parents before and after school and informs them about our written/oral translation services. Our 
findings are that the major languages in our school that the parents request translation are Spanish and Bengali. 
Teachers were informed of these findings during grade conferences and informal conversations. These services 
are for all parents, not just for parents of ELLs. We analyze data from ATS reports RHLA and RPOB and share with 
the school community including parents and teachers. We provide parents with translations when filling out 
student emergency cards and give them access to translators and translated versions. We use the information on 
the emergency contact cards and HLIS to determine preferred language.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

The parent coordinator sends out email blasts in the event of a school emergency.. We make phone calls in parents 
preferred language in any emergency situations through the use of bilingual staff and the translation /interpretation 
services. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In order to ensure the Limited English Speaking parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in 
and have access to programs and services critical to their child's education, we have translated language guides and 
posters in the school lobby from the NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit in order to welcome all Limited 
English speaking parents. Language Access Coordinators in the building were trained by the field support specialist 
about all material available to teachers and parents for translation services. These coordinators then turnkey 
information to the rest of the pedagogical and non pedagogical staff. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We will use bilingual staff and contact DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit whenever the need arises. We will 
show translated editions of the Parents' Bill of Rights, Parents' Guide to Language Access, Language ID Guide to 
provide translation and interpretation services to all parents who require such services. Our goal is to ensure that 
parents whose language is other than English are provided with the opportunity to participate in their child's 
education. We ensure this for all parents who require them, not just parents of ELLs. We plan to have school notices 
regarding parent workshops, PTA meetings, and Parent Teacher Conference notices translated. We also utilize the 
DOE translation unit, in addition to bilingual in-house staff and other outside vendors to translate our written notices. 
We plan to provide oral translation during the regular school day using our bilingual guidance counselors and our 
bilingual staff members. Signs are clearly posted in the main office/corridor for translation services. Whenever 
possible, provisions are made for parents to have immediate translation on the telephone or during school visits. We 
post signs regarding visitor access in translated languages to ensure that parents are not prevented from reaching the 
office due to language barriers.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Mechanisms we use to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services are parent surveys. 
Also feedback from PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, phone conversations, food festival, and assembly 
programs. In addition, the parent coordinator provides feedback from parents. Also parents fill out school surveys 
online in their home languages .
