Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of The School for Human Rights is to develop the academic and social capacity of all students, regardless 
of identity and ability. A combined 8 th through 12 th grade school, The School for Human Rights offers an integrated 
academic and social skills-based curriculum, to challenge its students to become critically thinking, compassionate, 
and socially engaged young adults committed to the practice of equity, dignity and social consciousness. As a result, 
we have an ongoing relationship with the Advocacy Lab. This organization provides curriculum and instruction to our 
school that addresses the aforementioned issues.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The principal has created an inclusive culture and climate that is beneficial to adult and student learning, providing 
students with enrichment clubs such as crochet, dance, sports, as well as computer classes for parents. The school 
also hosts an annual cultural festival for staff and families. School leadership utilizes a variety of sources to 
communicate expectations to school staff, and ensure ongoing parent feedback of student progress is consistent. 
Staff members are aware of the expectations and foster this understanding to articulate next steps to parents 
towards college and career readiness for students. 

The ELA shifts, in particular, which addresses vocabulary, writing to sources and reading complex texts align to this 
focus, and in Math, there is an increase in literacy as well. Students must demonstrate deep comprehension through 
their written justifications. 

We will continue our practice of conducting frequent cycles of observations. In the beginning of the school year, the 
principal met with each teacher and reflected on their previous year’s rating, and from this data, during each IPC 
meeting, came up with goals for each teacher according to their needs, in collaboration with the teacher. Teachers 
were able to self-reflect on their practice and create their own goals based on their NYS Regents exam results, Middle 
School State Assessments; in-house assessments and their effectiveness rating from the previous year. 

In alignment with the data from last year’s observations and student results, we delivered professional development 
on the Quality Review indicators in conjunction with the Danielson competencies to influence pedagogy in the 
classroom and ensure continued exploration and adherence to the Danielson Framework. Teacher inter-visitation 
with colleagues in support of 1A Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy, and 1E, Designing Coherent 
Instruction, in particular attention to the instructional shifts via rigorous task, and inclusion of the instructional focus. 
In the competency of 3B, Questioning and Discussion techniques 10 out of 29 teachers received a Highly Effective 
rating. Professional Development will target this competency as well in the form of addressing the Common Core 
Speaking and Listening Standards and Universal Designing for Learning (UDL) - principle of multiple means of 
expressions, multiple means of engagement and multiple means of representation.  

Another focus is to develop teachers’ expertise in the effective utilization of data in order to better recognize 
students’ problematic skill sets in the core subject areas. This will allow us to increase our ability to address those skill 
deficits and enhance differentiation of instruction. Identification of students not making adequate academic progress 
and putting in place the necessary support, such as Lunch Time tutorials, PM school and Saturday school to allow 
them to achieve academic success. Identify skill deficits and take the required steps to address those deficits. 

Currently, our Inquiry Teams are working on using assessments to inform pedagogical practices and refine curricula to 
reflect Common Core Learning standards. Teams are in the process of developing assessment tools that will be used 
to check students’ work and also have students evaluate their performance such as exit slips. 

Additionally, Danielson Framework component 3B, 3C, and 3D are used as guides/references during observations. 
Pre-test and post-test data are reviewed in Inquiry Teams meetings. The result of this review is used to reteach topics, 
change instructional practices and look for gaps in performance. For example: 

Data show differentiation with Word problems in Math – Math teachers therefore have to reteach or slow down the 
pace of certain topics and focus on math vocabulary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Frequent cycles of observation to check through formative assessments that students understand concepts. 

Teachers utilize data available in Acuity, ARIS, STARS, and formal State Assessment data, past Regents exams as guides 
for their planning and delivery of instruction. 

Through past and ongoing Professional Development, our Inquiry Teams are working on using assessments to inform 
pedagogical practices and refine curricula to reflect Common Core Learning Standards. Teams are in the process of 
developing assessment tools that will be used to check students’ work and also have students evaluate their 
performance such as exit slips. 

Staff regularly to discuss new methodologies for implementation in classrooms. Department conferences and study 
groups are also opportunities for teachers to meet to discuss and share best practices. Classroom intervisitation 
among teachers allows them to observe best practices. Teacher’s evaluation sheets turned in at the end of 
Professional Development meetings help administrators to plan future professional develop. Additionally, monthly 
staff development provided by FSC. 

In an effort to improve student achievement, the school decided to administer all NYC Performance Assessments to 
all students to create a data base of baseline scores so that we can track progress, improve instruction, and improve 
student achievement. With the use of NYC Performance assessment item analysis, ARIS item analysis and the analysis 
of past Regents and unit exams, teachers identify trends in student’s performances to guide the refinement of 
curriculum maps, unit plans, lesson plans, and academic tasks to better adjust instruction in order to promote student 
achievement.  

Teachers use formative, summative, and anecdotal data to inform student grouping, so as to identify and address 
various students’ needs.  

Collaboration 

The principal of The School for Human Rights has an excellent working relationship with the principal of High School 
for Public Service. The students share spaces and resources. SHR and HSPS share a lunch period, HSPS students attend 
ENL classes at SHR. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special student population are our ENL and SWD. The needs of our ENL population is English Language acquisition - 
Reading, writing and speaking. Our SWD population needs as per their IEP's. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our Instructional Focus is: Using Evidence in Argument. 

This goal was chosen because we believe that one way children learn is through argument and discussion. However, 
the vast majority of our children come from a culture where they are not exposed to these methods of learning. 
Therefore, as a means of getting students acculturated with the United States system of education and also 
developing new ways of learning, we have chosen this instructional focus. The intended outcome is that the students 
will then develop the skill of using evidence to support arguments in discussion which will help them develop stronger 
writing skills and also communication and collaboration skills that support college and career readiness.

In terms of instructional shifts, we do frequent cycles of observations and have made Danielson components 3B, 3C 
and 3D the major focus of our observations to see the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards 
instructional shifts. 

During observations, we also look for differentiation and various ways of expression, engagement, representations 
and adequate wait time to see how teachers are refining tasks to provide all students particularly ELL and Special 
Needs students with access. 

 We also look for higher levels of questioning and students use of evidence in argument. 

By using the Danielson Framework and incorporating the instructional shifts, we have revisited and decided to keep 
our instructional focus from last year. For our first Professional Development workshop, we determined that last 
year’s instructional focus, Evidence in Argument, needed further refinement. Regents data, and in-house assessment 
data, including last year’s NYC Performance Assessment, yielded that students needed to develop their knowledge of 
using evidence in argument. 

 

The School’s Instructional Focus is tied in with Danielson’s component 3B, 3C and 3D, and therefore during our 
observations we pay particular attention to the implementation of 3B, 3C and 3D. 

 Differentiation in the selection of groups, questions asked, topics presented, adequate wait time for all, particularly 
ELL and Special Needs students to participate and complimenting of all student. 

 High expectation for all students – high level of questioning, use of academic vocabulary, giving students ample 
opportunities to participate in discussion, encouraging and calling on volunteers and non-volunteers. 

 

The elements of framework for great schools in which we made the most progress over the year is in the area of 
supportive environment and the establishment of a culture of learning that communicates high expectations to staff, 
students and families. 

According to the School Quality Report (3.4) 

The principal strategically maximizes resources by programming to provide academic interventions for students 
during after-school and Saturday programs, providing professional development through Columbia University, and 
hiring additional paraprofessionals and teachers to provide support to high needs students. 

According to the PPO (4.1) 

Our instructional focus is aligned with Domain 3 of Danielson Framework. Although instructional supervisors have 
implemented cycles of teacher observation and feedback, a review and discussion of observation data provides 
evidence of the need for further planning for targeted professional development to ensure improved teacher 
practice.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Assessments will be analyzed every six weeks and results will be analyzed and results will inform curriculum planning. 

Based on New York State Math and ELA results (2018-2019), over 90% of our Middle School students scored levels 1 
and 2 (all students). According to (2018-2019) our item skills analysis of New York State Middle school results, 
students have difficulties with solving real world math problems, interpreting and computing quotients of fractions, 
statistics and probability. In ELA they are having difficulties with Contex clues, comprehension and vocabulary. We will 
therefore focus on addressing the aforementioned shill sets with the goal of improving academic results. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, through continuous administration and analysis of six week cycles of assessment. The school plans to 
improve levels 3 and 4 in math and ELA by 3% in 8th grade and also on level 3 and 4 on NYS Regents for grades 9 -12. 

January assessments will model NYS ELA and Math assessments and results will show performance gains.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
By June 2019, through the creation of a student-based mediation team, there will be a 3% increase in overall 
attendance and a 3% decrease in incidents as measured by the OORS report. 

The School for Human Rights is a 8-12 school that is a safe and student centered environment which allows for the 
academic growth of all students.  

Our school continues to maintain very good percentages (2017-2018) in terms of the satisfaction of our student, 
parents and teachers. Example – Rigorous Instruction 3.56%. Our attendance percentage was 88% for the last five 
years. Our High School graduation percentage also improved 83% 2017-2018. Our level of incidents continue to be 
low. We utilize a School Social Worker, Guidance Counselor, Parent Coordinator and Administrators to support our 
students socially, emotional and academically. We have monthly Attendance Committee meetings where the 
attendance of our students is discussed and monitored. Our School Social Worker supervises a Peer Mediation Team 
of students. Students are trained in resolving issues among their peers. Students felt that they wanted to create a 
process for supporting disruptive students as well as impacting disciplinary practice on a school wide level. With the 
addition of a new special education teacher and four educational paraprofessionals our Special Needs and ELL 
students are provided with more support and have experienced better academic results on local and state exams. Our 
goal is to increase our level of support for all school constituents in creating an even better supportive environment, 
and therefore improve the aforementioned statistics. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Secure accredited organization to provide student training 
and resources for Peer Mediation. Create least restrictive 
criteria for selecting students to participate. Accept input 
from teachers and administrators for student nominations. 
Provide school support for new student Peer Mediators to 
take action and impact positive change. This program will 
become a viable option used to reduce student suspensions 
and other disciplinary measures. 

Group meetings will be conducted by the School Social 
Worker with a focus on school community. Students will begin 
by focusing on school-based change first. The training will 
enable our students to become peaceful and effective 
activists for change in school and the wider community. 

 

 

Students with IEP’s and disciplinary records will be selected to 
the program. Students with a history of incidents would be 
encouraged to consider the program, as a method of 
counseling and training for change.

and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Students will be administered Middle School and High School assessment to determine progress towards achieving 
the annual goal by the end of the school year (June 2019). Grade Teams will analyze data such as Item Skills Analysis 
credit accumulation by cohort, and ELA and Math data for Middle School and High School. 

 

The major focus of our school is to develop teachers’ expertise in the effective utilization of data in order to better 
recognize students’ problematic skill sets in the core subject areas. This will allow us to increase our ability to address 
those skill deficits and enhance differentiation of instruction. Identification of students not making adequate 
academic progress and putting in place the necessary support, such as Lunch Time tutorials, PM school and Saturday 
school to allow them to achieve academic success. Identify skill deficits and take the required steps to address those 
deficits. 

Currently, our Inquiry Teams are working on using assessments to inform pedagogical practices and refine curricula to 
reflect Common Core Learning standards. Teams are in the process of developing assessment tools that will be used 
to check students’ work and also have students evaluate their performance such as exit slips. 

Through past and ongoing Professional Development, our Inquiry Teams are working on using assessments to inform 
pedagogical practices and refine curricula to reflect Common Core Learning Standards. Teams are in the process of 
developing assessment tools that will be used to check students’ work and also have students evaluate their 
performance such as exit slips. 

Staff meets regularly to discuss new methodologies for implementation in classrooms. Department conferences and 
study groups are also opportunities for teachers to meet to discuss and share best practices. Classroom intervisitation 
among teachers allows them to observe best practices. Teacher’s evaluation sheets turned in at the end of 
Professional Development meetings help administrators to plan future professional develop.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will have a 3% improvement in ELA and Math State Assessments. This will be achieved through Inquiry 
Teams and collaboration among departments there will conduct cyclical analysis of assessment data. This will lead to an 
improvement in 3% on ELA and Math State Assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The majority of teachers at The School Human Rights teachers have been teaching for 5+ years and were rated 
Effective for the 2017-2018 school year. Teacher development and support by administrator will continue for the 
2018-2019 school year through the use of the Danielson Rubric, individual support, department and faculty meetings. 

The principal and assistant principal assume the responsibility for setting high expectations for all students through 
on-going observation, interaction, feedback, and intervention with students of all levels. The administration will 
message the school’s expectations for success, for teachers, parents, and students. In 2017 - 2018 school year, 29 
teachers were rated Effective. Teachers will utilize inter-visitation as a method for improving teacher practice. 
Administration will support developing teachers with classroom resources, goal setting, and professional 
development. Developing teachers will be offered the ability to participate in Academic Intervention Services with 
struggling students. Teacher scholarship data will be examined after each marking period. Feedback on student 
scholarship will be shared with teachers. 

Last year (2017-2018) 10 teachers attained a Highly Effective on component 3B. All others were rated either 
developing or effective on 3B, 3C and 3D at least once. We therefore expect that with Professional Development on 
these components, teachers will continue to refine their practices and improve their rating.  

We believe that teachers still need to improve their practices of using questioning and discussion techniques 3B; 
engaging students in learning (3C) and using assessment in instructions (3D). With more professional development 
and frequent cycles of observations and feedback on these components we expect better results this year. We will 
therefore continue our focus on these components. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
For school year 2018-2019 through on going Professional Development offered by their Administration and Teachers, 
followed by frequent cycles of observation and feedback 80% of teachers will show improvement in Domain 3 of the 
Danielson Rubric, by June 2019.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Over the last three to four years we have experienced a decline in parent involvement at our school, i.e.; PTA 
meetings, Parent involvement workshops, computer class for parents and parent teacher conferences. We have 
therefore identified the need to foster greater parent attendance at the aforementioned school functions and events. 
The School for Human Rights will therefore engage in various forms of parent involvement i.e. call messenger, e-mails, 
SLT and PTA recruitment, computer classes for parents, encourage parent involvement in our annual cultural arts 
festival, and the use of Jupiter One online grading system. We will work with our CBO’s to conduct outreach to 
students and parents for various programs – Urban Advantage, Global Kids, FYI, CAVI and Build On. We believe that 
fostering stronger relations with our CBO’s will increase communications with parents. We will use the following data 
sources to monitor parental outreach and make modifications as necessary – parent attendance sign-in sheets, 
Jupiter One and AIS rosters.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

By June 2019, through a wide-range of school sponsored events/activities, parental involvement will increase by 5%, as 
measured by attendance data at the aforementioned events.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 17K531, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

The School for Human Rights support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  
We use the results of the LAB-R and the NYSESLAT to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  Middle school students are at 
the Beginners (1), Intermediate (1) and Advanced (1) levels based on the 2014 NYSESLAT report.  We find that the weakest 
modality lies in Writing. Special attention is paid to writing in their classes (both ESL and ELA).  Because of our small ELLs 
population in the Middle School (6th - 1, 7th - 1 and 8th - 1) no other assessment tool is used.  
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Inquiry Teams and Department Teams where we examine ELL's academic performance and discuss strategies for improving 
students performance.

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our ESL program from data collected from various assessments throughout the year.  These 
assessments include classroom tests and quizzes in the different subject areas along with classroom portfolios and from the 
NYSESLAT scores.  We look at movement across the four skills as well as at the various proficiency levels.  Results from the 
periodic assessments during the year as well as a comparison between the MOSL Beginning of Year and the MOSL End of Year 
exams, also provide us with good indicators of how well we are doing with our ELLs.  Credit accumulation and Regents passing 
rates (see pp. 5 & 6 above) as well as graduation rates among our ELLs are also helpful when we consider this question.  We 
also consider attendance and participation in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities as they indicate that ELLs are building 
confidence in their ability to interact in the wider society.  We offer clubs like chess, dance, crochet, sewing, music and 
newspaper journalism, as well programs like internship at the Downstate Medical Center, Big Brother/Big Sister for middle 
schoolers, Build-on, Global Kids, FYI and the CORO Leadership Program.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Inquiry Teams and Department Teams where we examine data and adjust lesson to address areas where students 
demonstrate weakness. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
Not applicable as we do not have K-5 classes 
     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  
Evaluation of the ELLs' language ability is done first with the NYSITELL  exam for new entrants and later through the NYSESLAT 
which is administered once a year.  These examinations provide information on the students’ ability in the four language skills 
(listening, speaking, reading and writing) as well as their overall level (entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding or 
commanding).  We also noted that the ELLs are weakest in the listening and writing modalities while their greatest strength is 
in reading and speaking.  Although their reading skill is generally good, there is room for improvement especially with the 
depth of reading demanded by the Common Core standards 
.   
Based on the results of the NYSESLAT of May 2014, the ESL students are at the Beginning (7), Intermediate (3) and Advanced 
(13) levels.  Whether there will an improvement based on the reformated NYSESLAT of 2015 remains to be seen.  These results 
will have implications for instruction as they provide data on the modalities where emphasis is needed and where diligent one-
on-one and small group tutoring is required. 
    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Findings are disseminating during our Professional Development sessions on Monday's and Tuesday's, and also in 
Departmental Teams and Inquiry Teams. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The School for Human Rights is a 6 – 12 school that currently provide instruction for a total of over 400 students. The 
school is located in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn and we share a building with three other schools in what 
was formerly the George Wingate High School.  On campus, we share the cafeteria, gymnasiums and library with the 
other schools.  Most of our students are from a low socio-economic background and so are eligible for free or low-
cost meals.  
The number of ELL students is relatively small (23 students ranging from Grade 6 to Grade 12).  We have adopted the 
Inclusion model with collaborative team teaching and pull out/push-in of ENL and SETSS teachers in the majority of 
our classrooms, and have capped class size at around 30 students, and where possible have reduced that number 
even further.  Currently three of our staff are fluent in Spanish, with five staff members fluent in Haitian Creole and 
French.  We believe this is fundamental in providing support for the ELL population of our school. This allows for 
better modified instruction within regular education classrooms as well as better support of, and communication 
with, the families of these students.  ENL classes are of the Push In/Pull Out model and instruction is provided by the 
ENL teacher.   
    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable as we offer no TBE program.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable as we offer no DL progran.    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           ESL classes are done using a Push-in/Pull-out model, along with an ungraded 9  th   period for all ENL students from 
Monday to Friday.  The ELLs are also programmed in CTT classes where they are offered extra help.   
  
Content area teachers (the Social Studies, the Sciences, Mathematics and ELA) are thus supported in the instruction of our 
ELLs.  Bilingual para-professionals are also on hand with the ENL teacher to offer individual help in the classroom.  This is the 
best organization we can offer as we have a heterogeneous group of 23 students from Grade 6 (3), Grade 7 (2), Grade 8 (2), 
Grade 9 (7), Grade 10 (3), Grade 11 (3) and Grade 12 (3).  Lunch-time tutoring and well as after-school classes are also offered, 
especially in reading writing.  Help with homework in all content areas is also offered on an individual basis during the after-
school classes.  
  
ELLs  receive the mandated number of minutes as stated in the New York Chancellor's Regulations Part 154, in the following 
way: 
  
(a) Entering (Beginners) 
                     - after-school tutoring - average of 4 days x 40 minutes = 160 minutes 
                     - average of 80 minutes per students per day in push-in/pull out activities = 400 minutes 
                      TOTAL: average of 560 mintues  
 (b) Emerging & Transitioning (Intermediate) 
                      - after-school tutoring - average of 4 days x 40 minutes = 160 minutes 
                      - average of 40 minutes per student per day in push-in/pull-out activities = 200 minutes 
                        TOTAL: average of 360 minutes 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 c) Expanding (Advance) 
                   -  after-school tutoring 2 days x 40 minutes = 80 minutes 
                   -  average of 40 minutes per day in push in/pull out activities = 200 minutes 
                      TOTAL : average of 280 minutes 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Our ELLs' skill levels are determined from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results, as well as from assessments done at regular 
intervals.  Content area teachers also provide their assessments of students' needs.  As most of these needs are in the analysis 
of more complex reading texts, intervention in this skill includes strategies like scaffolding, role-play, buddy reading, 
predicting, use of graphic organizers to assist comprehension, think-pair-share.  Such activities are intended to make content 
as understandable as possible and to promote language development.  In content area classes, bilingual paraprofessionals 
provide native language support where needed while the ENL teacher provides this support when pushing in and during lunch 
and after-school tutoring. 
  
        Six of our ENL students receive special education services in accordance with the requirements of their IEPs.  These 
students are also pulled-out daily for resource room activities.  Content area teachers are also provided with copies of their 
IEPs so that they may become familiar with the special needs of those students who are programmed in their classrooms.  
         
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELLs are not evaluated in their home language in this school. 
   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
a.  ELLs who are SIFEs  receive daily instruction in ESL and ELA.  In their content area classrooms, they are monitored by the 
ENL teacher who pushes-in, and by native language speaking teachers and paraprofessional who provide 
translation/interpretation help when needed.  They are also offered extended day tutoring and attendance at our Saturday 
Academy.  They are paired with a buddy, especially in their early days, to help with comprehension. 
  
b) Newcomers 
- Buddy system by which the weaker (newer) students are paired with more proficient students to orient and offer assistance 
to the newcomer. 
- Home-school communication (parents fill out the form on the language they would prefer for oral and written 
communication between them and the school). 
- Encouragement to attend tutoring sessions during the lunch period and after school. 
- Small group academic intervention where needed, especially in the content areas. 
- Programming into CTT content classes where they could receive better attention, including help from bilingual 
paraprofessionals and the ENL teacher.   
  
c & d)  ELLs receiving services 4 - 6 years and Long Term ELLs (over 6 years) 
- Rigorous program of instruction and tutoring in the content areas. 
- Regular tutoring program for those taking Regents examinations, including during after-school and Saturday school tutoring. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

- Emphasis in improving the reading and writing modalities. 
- Close monitoring of results and reports in periodic assessments (Math and ELA) to identify areas of weakness in order to 
differentiate instruction where needed. 
  
e) Former ELLs who have been evaluated as proficient continue to receive extended time in all State exams and periodic 
assessments for two years.  They continue to have access to glossaries and ESL dictionaries in class and for exams.  They are 
assigned to General Education classes and are offered after-school and Saturday School tutoring (in English). 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  
Among our ELL population, there are 6 students also designated SWDs.  These students range from 6  th   Grade (2), 7  
th   Grade (1), 8  th   Grade (1) and 9  th   Grade (2).  The two Special Needs teachers work closely with these students using the 
Push-in and Pull-out approach so that they may receive services in accordance with their IEPs. They work in collaboration with 
the ENL and ELA teachers to identify students' individual needs and in planning lessons for them.  Because of the small number 
in each grade level, the material used if more often than not teacher-created.  
   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Special Needs teachers work with the ENL teacher to plan for the ELL-SWD.  In content area classes, teacher push in to help 
SWD with comprehension of the material.  With the aim of improving their English proficiency, especially in Reading and 
Writing (their Listening and Speaking are generally at grade level) the teacher work closely with the ENL teacher.  In addition, 
these students are each assigned a para-professional to help them in their classes.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  
All content area teachers are properly licensed and are able to adequately deliver the necessary instruction.  For those ELLs 
whose English is limited and for whom instruction in English may be difficult to understand, help is offered by the ENL teacher 
who pushes in and through a bilingual para-professional in the classroom.  Separate one-on-one tutoring time during the lunch 
period and after school is scheduled for them.  After school tutoring is generally used to help ELLs with their homework. 
  
Also, data derived from periodic assessments in ELA and Math provide the basis for targeting ELLs' weak areas for special 
emphasis in tutoring.  When necessary, content area teachers are encouraged to participate in professional development that 
focus on instructional strategies for ELLs.  Special attention is paid to helping ELLs acquire and negotiate mathematical 
academic language to help make understanding and solving word problems easier.  This involves math vocabulary exercises 
through the use of word walls, use of flash card, vocabulary index cards, and the compilation of glossaries and mini-
dictionaries.  Similar vocabulary exercises along with content-area reading exercises are part of the ELLs' Science and Social 
Studies classes. 
  
ELLs are also taught to make proper use of ENL dictionaries and glossaries in the classroom and in examinations.  Students 
taking Regents exams are taught how to access and use websites such as "regentsprep.org" and "khanacademy.org" which 
offers on-line tutoring as well as past Regents exam papers for practice purposes.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  
In the general ELL population in the Middle School,  the plan is use the Fountas and Pinnel reading program to assessment the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

beginning students' reading levels furing the 2015-16 school year.  This will include Middle School ELLs and will be an 
important tool for assessing their reading competence.   
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There is no plan to change or discontinue any of the present programs and services offered to our ELLs during the year.   
   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  
As much as possible, with the resources we have, we do offer support services that correspond to the age and grade level of 
the ELLs.  There are extended classroom time  and after-school programs for language enrichment and Math practice.  They 
have access to all programs offered by the school and at the campus-wide level.  We involve parents by informing them of such 
activities by way of letters or by phone calls of what our ELLs are required to do. 
     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
  
ELLs have access to a library with a wide range of book in English, Spanish and French.  We also use NYSESLAT preparation 
texts, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries in a variety of school subjects.  Every classroom is equiped with computers and at 
least one printers.  Therefore our ELLs have access to eletronic media for research and preparation of typed assignments.  In 
addition, our classrooms all have Smart Boards installed, which enhances interest and comprehension through the use of more 
visuals.  The school also has two laptop carts which teachers can schedule for use in lessons.  There is also a MACLAB which is 
used to teach research skills to our ELLs.  These facilities are regularly used by content area teachers in in the Social Studies, 
Science, Math and English. 
  
The following texts books are used, taking into account the proficiency level of the ELLs:  Beginning ESL; Survival at School; A 
Survival Vocabulary Series (Job Application Language, Supermarket Language, Computer Hardware Language, Drugstore 
Language, Banking Language, Medical Language); Readings in the Content Area; What a Life Reader (Beginners, High Beginners 
and Intermediate Levels), Readings in English 1 and 2; A New Beginning: An ESL Reader. 
There is also "Getting Ready for NYESELAT" with accompanying CDs of listening activities which provide an awareness of the 
format of the exam along with practice exercises. 
   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

  
On entering school for the first time, beginning ELLs are offered language support through the buddy system where an ELL 
with a higher proficiency is paired with a lower proficient student to offer help and language support, especially with 
comprehension.  In addition, bilingual paraprofessionals push-in to help.  Unfortunately, there is no Urdu speaker on staff to 
help the 1 student but this does not present a challenge as his entry level English i quite good.  ELLs are also offered relevant 
glossaries and bilingual dictionaries and are guided on how to use these. 
    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  
All support services and resources correspond to our ELLs ages and grade levels.  Bilingual teachers and paraprofessionals are 
always available to offer support, both academically and socially.  Guidance counsellors and the social worker are available if 
and when the need arises and the students know this. Our ELL-SWD are also pulled out by the Special Needs teachers for 
Resourse Room assistance. 
    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
  
ELLs have access to a library with a wide range of book in English, Spanish and French.  We also use NYSESLAT preparation 
texts, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries in a variety of school subjects.  Every classroom is equiped with computers and at 
least one printers.  Therefore our ELLs have access to eletronic media for research and preparation of typed assignments.  In 
addition, our classrooms all have Smart Boards installed, which enhances interest and comprehension through the use of more 
visuals.  The school also has two laptop carts which teachers can schedule for use in lessons.  There is also a MACLAB which is 
used to teach research skills to our ELLs.  These facilities are regularly used by content area teachers in in the Social Studies, 
Science, Math and English. 
  
The following texts books are used, taking into account the proficiency level of the ELLs:  Beginning ESL; Survival at School; A 
Survival Vocabulary Series (Job Application Language, Supermarket Language, Computer Hardware Language, Drugstore 
Language, Banking Language, Medical Language); Readings in the Content Area; What a Life Reader (Beginners, High Beginners 
and Intermediate Levels), Readings in English 1 and 2; A New Beginning: An ESL Reader. 
There is also "Getting Ready for NYESELAT" with accompanying CDs of listening activities which provide an awareness of the 
format of the exam along with practice exercises. 
   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
  
We recognize that making the transition into our school system is a big one for newly admitted ELLs.  If we are aware of any 
new ELLs entering our school in September, we invite the parents to sent their children to summer school for a few weeks so 
that they may start to make the transition before regular school starts.  They are also introduced to other ELLs with the same 
language and cultural background.  The new comers also receive an informal orientation session to familiarize them with the 
layout of the school e.g. location of bathroom, library, gym, cafeteria, computer room.  There is also a month-long Bridge 
Program for those entering the 9  th   Grade.  New ELLs entering the 9  th   Grade are part of this program.   
  
For those enrolled during the school year, we introduce them to their core subject teachers, and they are paired with a buddy 
student of the same grade level who will help them with the transition and guide and help them with their academic work. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  
Our school offers Spanish and French as language electives for all high school ELLs and Spanish in the 8  th   Grade.  As they 
have the same high school graduation requirements as all other students, high school ELLs are enrolled in one of the language 
classes mentioned above so that they may acquire the required amount of credits for graduation.  Those who show the 
required competency in their native language, especially in reading and writing, take the language exam at the Regents level. 
    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not offer a dual language program because of the low numbers of ELLs and so lack of resourses.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  
At the School for Human Rights, professional development for teachers is provided by the administrative staff as well as 
personnel from the Office of English Language Learners (OELL). 
  
Within the school, professional development takes the form of: 
- Training of teachers in understanding and implementation of CCLS; realignment of curriculum to match CCLS schoolwide and 
across all content areas. 
- Twice a month Inquiry Team Meetings: assessing students' work to determing levels mastery of CCLS competencies. 
- On-site training in Culturally Responsive Education for all school staff, including paraprofessionals, secretaries, social worker, 
parent coordinator and PTA representative. 
- Twice monthly in-house workshops on ADVANCE - the DOE's Teacher Evaluation and Development System at grade and 
departmental levels. 
- Departmental team workshops that examine curriculum and tasks to improve Common Core readiness. 
- Sessions on scaffolding instruction in Math and Science through experiments and the use of manipulatives. 
- Sessions on sharing of online resources that can make instruction more effective. 
- Differentiation of instruction as a general rule but more especially with ELLs at different levels of proficiency. 
- Using MOSL (BOY and EOY) assessment item analysis to gather relevant data that can drive instruction. 
- Accessing and understanding students' IEPs so as to be aware of their needs and accommodations (run by the School-based 
Support staff).  
  
Workhops off-site include: 
- NYSESLAT administration and scoring of the writing modality. 
- Professional Development workshops offered bythe Office of English Language Learners. 
  
  
In-house training of teachers in understandng and implementing the CCLS in all disciplines along with workshops on realigning 
curriculum to CCLS across all content areas.  
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
This is a 6-12 school.  Most teachers teach at both levels.  Some would have helped to administer the NYSESLAT exams and to 
score the writing modality.  The students who move on from the 8  th    (middle school) to 9  th   grade (high school) would 
have already known their high school teachers.  In addition, the ENL teacher reviews the NYSESLAT results with the relevant 
high school teachers so they may begin to understand the level and needs of the ELLs. There is also the Summer Bridge 
Program for these students in ELA, Math and Science.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 We offer Parent Involvement Workshops three times a semester.  ELL's parents are also invited.  We encourage our ELL to 
urge their parents to attend.  The Parent Coordinator also make contact with all parents (which includes ELL parents).  At these 
meetings, teachers and para-professional are on hand to help with interpretation if necessary.  In some cases, we have noted 
that the ELLs have helped their parents with interpretation. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Some ELL parents are involves in a number of activities including helping to prepare for and attending our annual Cultural Arts 
Festival.  They also help to pack and sell school uniforms. The Parent Coordinator is in regular contact with all parents (which 
includes ELL parents.)  All are invited to attend College and Career Planning evenings and Financial Aid Workshops for parents 
and students in the 11  th   and 12  th   Grade.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Alexander, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a potential ELL is admitted to the school, the parent express their language preference for the Home 
Language Identification Survey form. We have currently used this form in six languages. Parents are also asked to 
complete the form that says what language they would like to receive written information and the language they 
would prefer to communicate orally with the school. This information is useful when we need to communicate 
with parents of ELLs about aspects of their children education. If the parent has minimal or no knowledge of 
English, we suggest that a trusted member of the family translate for them or to have the school provide a 
translator. In most cases, a member of staff act as an oral interpretor, which is acceptable with parents. Parents 
are also given the brochure "Guide for Parents of English Language Learners" in an appropriate language. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

In addition, such data could be accessed through ATS job "BIOS" (Biographical by student) which include the 
student's home language, as do data from student's Blue Cards. Another important source of information is 
Parent Survey which parents their preference of language for written communication from and to the school. 
Teachers also collect data on their students and their survey include languages spoken by the students and their 
preference for communication purposes. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

The information on the 
completed forms 
mentioned above provide 
data on the ELLs parent 
population who will need 
translation and 
interpretation services. 
This information is 
reported to the school 
community (general office 
staff, parent coordinator 
and teachers) by the 
principal and ESL teacher.  

The languages of 
preference for oral 
communication are: 

1. ARABIC

who are proficient in the languages of our ELL 
population (Haitian Creole, French and 
Spanish). English-speaking members of the 
family provide interpretation services for our 
Arabic and Urdu speaking parents. 

 

 

We have staff members 
(teachers/paraprofessional/school aides), who 
speak Haitian Creole, Spanish and Arabic who 
can provide these services. 

In situations where a parent speaks a language 
not spoken by a staff, we will make 
arrangements for a translator from the DOE 
translation department.

Messages will also be translated using Google Translate and relayed to parents via phone. Get support from DOE 
providers. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We use translated documents from the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site: 
http://intranet.nycboe,net/SchoolSupport_and_interpretatin_unit. At such meetings, members of staff are available 
to help with interpretation. 

There also signs in various languages identifying bathroom and main office. There are signs welcoming parents and 
guardians and informing them of their rights to have information in the language they speak. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

At meetings (i.e. parent/teachers conferences) we regularly ask those parents who attend if there is any problems 
with understanding what is being said to them or if there are able to be understood. At such meetings, members of 
staff are available to help with interpretation.
