Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

of the mind that will enable them to maximize their unique academic, social, and emotional potentials, becoming 
well-rounded citizens of our world. Our partnerships with various community based organizations and our sister 
school in Queens along with a rigorous, relevant, and responsive CCLS aligned curriculum allow us to meet the 
developmental needs and interests of each and every one of our students. Our core values of Perseverance, 
Community, Acceptance, Responsibility and Education ground all that we do. 

VOYAGES SOUTH understands and appreciates that the traditional high school is not right for everyone. With this 
purpose in mind, we will create a small and safe transfer school to provide a learning environment where all work 
towards continued success. We at VOYAGES SOUTH are committed to providing over-age, under-credited students 
the opportunity to re-engage in high school and earn a Regents Diploma. To facilitate graduation in a timely manner, 
we offer a rigorous, accelerated credit accumulation program that allows our most dedicated and hardworking 
students the opportunity to earn up to 21 credits a year. At VOYAGES SOUTH, we will build upon the unique talents 
and strengths of each of our students and provide every student the support needed to maximize their individual 
academic, emotional, and social potentials. Our partnerships with various community organizations will help to 
ensure our students’ success by providing every student with an individual counselor to assist them with academic 
support, employment, counseling, college exploration, career awareness, and internships. Our students will leave us 
equipped with the essential skills and knowledge necessary to live as informed citizens in a multicultural, democratic 
society and to pursue a successful post-secondary education and/or career. In addition, VOYAGES SOUTH will offer 
students opportunities to learn through a program of positive community service, reinforcing our core values, while 
providing the skills necessary for their development as citizens in the larger world. 

As a transfer school VOYAGES South has a strategic partnership with the community based organization Queens 
Community House. This partnership provide both advocate counseling services and individual supports for each of our 
students as well as organizing internships through the Learning to Work Program. In addition to our working 
relationship with QCH, VOYAGES South High School has also formed strategic partnerships with the following 
organizations: 

1. SCO family of services for counseling, multi system treatment, academic interventions, and family services. 

2. Safe Space Jamaica: This program offers a multitude of services for our young people from teen support groups, 
reproductive health care and counseling. They have a drop in center for LGBTQ young adults.There is a family

VOYAGES South High School has developed a school wide initiative that identifies our yearly Senior Cohort based on 
credit accumulation and state test schedules. This initiative has led to several strategies whose expectations are 
connected to college and career readiness and an individualized academic plan for each potential graduate. Below is a 
brief summary of this special initiative:  

1. An ongoing collaboration between D.O.E., C.B.O., Counseling Interns, and the C.A.S.P. program staff called the 
VOYAGES SOUTH College readiness Team that supports students who are creating their post-secondary plans. 

2. Seniors are in cohorts by date of graduation and provided senior advisers in addition to Advocate Counselors who 
monitor their academic progress, schedule regular check ins, provide academic supports and planning, and facilitate 
individualized attention during the college application process. 

3. Every senior has a total of 9 RESPONSIBILITIES to accomplish prior to their graduation. Seniors are responsible for a 
senior binder/portfolio that provides evidence of the nine responsibilities:

As an ongoing challenge faced with our transfer school population, transcript credit evaluation, progress thru credit 
accumulation, NYS Regents test scores and cohort or expected graduation rates are in constant need of revision and 
assessment. Our staff and student representatives identified the need for a clear and consistently reliable form of 
communicating where individual students were at academically. As a result, VOYAGES South developed the Student 
Tracker initiative to create and communicate individual academic plans for each of our students. This initiative has 
several key components including the following: 

1. Every student meets with counseling staff and our director of programming to formulate a plan of credit 
accumulation, ongoing scheduling of classes, and intended dates for NYS Regents exams and graduation. This plan is 
revisited following the end of each trimester. 

2. The Student Tracker holds all transcript data and information from the programming meetings for each individual 
student and is an accessible running record of student work towards graduation. The student tracker is part of the 
VOYAGES South migration to online accessibility for all community members through the use of GOOGLE Education.  

3. A large, easily understood Student Tracker board for student’s to visualize where they are or are headed towards 
their hopeful graduation date. 

VOYAGES South continues to develop as both a school providing a rigorous academic environment and a community 
that supports the emotional and social growth of over aged and under credited students. Although only in our second 
year of existence our school has proven to be a viable and important alternative to the many students of South 
Queens who have not been successful in their previous schools. The following are our learning community’s 
strengths, accomplishments, and challenges using the six elements of the Capacity Framework as a rubric: 

VOYAGES South has made several strategic decisions moving forward into our sixth year. Our strength in providing 
rigorous instruction is through continued development of school wide curriculum and instruction that aligns to NYS 
High School Standards while at the same time addressing the many academic needs of a transfer school population. 
VOYAGES South has implemented and created many of the systems and structures that are necessary for high 
academic expectations and goals. The following accomplishments highlight our strengths as we create instruction that 
is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core in every classroom : 

1. Continued professional development for teaching staff on the CCLS and the use of Depth of Knowledge, Critical 
Thinking Skills, scaffolding and the use of data systems through the guidance of teacher led PD Teams. In addition, our 
third year will include a continued collaboration with the RE-Design group, providing extensive onsite coaching to our 
ELA department. This coaching will provide ongoing support as we develop an ELA curriculum that is skill based,

engaging, and differentiated for transfer high school students of varying reading levels. RE-Design will also be working 
with our math department.  

2. Our Common Core Team has addressed the instructional shifts of the CCLS, focusing on best practices for increasing 
literacy across all subject areas. Our subject teacher teams have begun developing curriculum according to the CCLS 
instructional shifts, implementing common across the classroom strategies for increasing literacy skills.. 

3. VOYAGES South teaching staff continues to develop rigorous lesson planning and through the Guided Learning 
Planning initiative, building classroom instruction on the principals of frequent checks for understanding, classroom 
discussion, student centered work, multiple entry points, differentiated and activity based approaches for students 
with below level academic skills.  

4. Our school continues to respond to the needs of our students through the creation of a writing workshop class that 
assists struggling readers and writers and is focused on informational text and the CCLS. 

5. Teaching staff continues to work on our Storefront Initiative that creates visually engaging, interactive, text rich 
classrooms that showcase student work and shared feedback strategies. 

 

6. Teaching staff has developed several advanced classes as part of our college readiness initiative including an 
advanced literature class, 3D Math/Modeling Class, Advanced Algebra class, and Constuction/Sculpture project class. 

VOYAGES South continues to build a well-developed culture of support and understanding for our transfer students. 
Our strength is in the close collaboration our D.O.E. staff has with Queen’s community House. Each individual student 
is known to the adults of our school community through a shared and thoughtful approach. Staff continues to 
implement systems, sharing data to identify and respond to both student and family needs. Our strength is in 
providing an environment that allows our students to make the important decisions necessary to complete their high 
school education.  

VOYAGES South continues to encourage teacher collaboration through regularly scheduled peer Learning 
Walkthroughs, teacher led Professional Development. Our school collaborates through Google Drive to upload and 
share lessons, videos and other materials that can be used in the classroom and is shared with the entire school 
community. Teacher teams meet twice a week, continually contributing to the school community as they work on 
implementing the CCLS, analyzing student data, and developing instructional goals and initiatives. 

Voyages South continues to build strong family-community ties through various family workshops, community based 
service projects, resources for families, and an active PTA and SLT. Our school is a welcoming place for parents, whose 
additional support of our efforts is vital for the growth and success of our transfer students. 

Our challenges are inherent in the model of our school. Transfer students have been unsuccessful, at times after 
many attempts, in more traditional schools. Our population is academically challenging, with the majority assessed at 
far below grade level literacy requiring urgent interventions despite having to complete the rigorous and accelerated 
credit accumulation necessary for graduation. Our students and staff struggle with how to best set fair and reasonable 
expectations for learning, especially when aligning to NYS Standards. In addition to the numerous academic supports 
our students require, many of our transfer students must cope with social and emotional obstacles from 
incarceration, homelessness, and abuse to illness and having childcare needs of their own. Our population is also very 
transient in nature, with families continually uprooted and moving to areas that require tremendous travel time. Our 
location in South Queens in the August Martin Campus is a specific challenge with limited available public 
transportation, neglected facilities, and a building whose reputation is unfortunately negative when publicly 
expressed. Our ability to use technology is limited at best with a crumbling infrastructure, antiquated Internet access, 
and well documented neglect. In this our second year, we are limited in classroom space, having constantly shifting 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

rooms for teaching staff, while always adjusting to construction schedules that have closed bathrooms and gym space 
completely. 

Despite the many challenges our focus will be on the continued growth in the following areas: 

1. Common sense, practical and school wide implementation and curriculum alignment of the CCLS in a transfer 
school setting. 

2. Continue to create and establish overarching systems and understandings of how to support and sustain student 
social, emotional, developmental, and academic health. 

3. Continue to promote teacher collaboration, identifying best practices and strategies for instructional planning. 

4. Continue to develop specific and measurable (SMART) goals for a shared vision of student success at VOYAGES 
South Queens. The continued articulation of this vision coupled with the specific strategies for shared leadership and 
teacher development. 

5. Continue to develop multiple tools for regular communication with students and families that promote high 
academic and social expectations for students. To further our school’s natural evolution to support both our student’s 
academic and social needs as well as the families that are a necessary part of success. 

6. Create an environment of trust throughout our community through consistently high academic and social 
expectations. To develop trust through a caring community that collectively communicates our core values and 
encourages continued learning and college readiness. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
VOYAGES South High School is a NYC DOE Transfer high school located on the second floor of the August Martin High 
School Campus. Our school is currently in her fourth year of development, having been founded in July of 2013. There 
are currently 255 students enrolled in our community of over aged and under credited students who have transferred 
from across South Queens and Brooklyn. Our Mission as stated below is one that identifies the individual challenges 
our unique population faces and our intention to build and provide students with a supportive and rigorous path to 
graduation. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

VOYAGES South Queens is a transfer high school whose population is both over aged and under credited and highly at 
risk. This population requires a specific set of supports that include: 

 

1. Consistant individual counseling. 

2. Individualized academic support for students who have misses extensive instructional time.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

VOYAGES South Queens made the most progress this past year in the key element of rigorous instruction. Through 
our work with the Transfer School Institute, ReDesign Coaching and Eskolta, teaching staff created a system of 
building reading and writing skills through engaging classroom activities that were shared and implemented school 
wide in all subject areas. Based on the data from both formative and summative assessments, including NYS regents 
and STARS, credit accumulation and the examination of student work, teaching staff recognized the need to further 
support individual students in reading and writing skills. Teaching staff embedded learning strategies into curriculum

that focused on skill development aligned to both the NYS/NYC Standards and College Readiness metrics. Strategies 
included determining importance, questioning, and inferring, pushing student critical thinking skills, and providing 
several school wide writing initiatives.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In our fourth year of existence, development continues for a common sense, practical and school wide 
implementation of the NYS Standards in a transfer school setting. This needs assessment was based on data from our 
annual QR, feedback from the School Quality report and PPO observation from the Office of Superintendent as well as 
the extensive ongoing work we have done with the RE-Design professional development and consultation group. 
Teaching staff should continue improving the review and use of data to inform instruction in all core subject areas for 
all identified subgroups, including special education students. 
School Needs: 
1. Ensure that teachers are able to develop and implement lessons that align to NYS Standards and provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all students. Using strategies and initiatives developed by the Common 
Core Team during professional development. 
2. Use meeting time for subject teams to rigorously review lesson plans, examine student work through school wide 
collaborative protocols to ensure alignment to the NYS Standards. Provide additional PD on Data Driven Instruction 
protocols; ensure teachers incorporate PD strategies into their instruction practices through observational cycles and 
peer developed learning walkthroughs, lesson study and timely feedback.  
3. Provide dedicated meeting times for staff to develop interdisciplinary instruction that will include the arts, 
technology and enrichment opportunities for all students. Provide PD for all teachers on the effective use of 
interdisciplinary enrichment in their planning and instruction. Continue development of cross curriculum writing 
workshop classes, shared strategies for literacy development, academic vocabulary work, and engaging rigorous 
instructional activities using non-traditional text and materials.  
4. Create a system for teachers to consistently review formative and summative assessments to ensure the alignment 
between the curriculum and assessments and to provide quality feedback to students that will improve student 
achievement. Creation of school wide common practices that allow for student feedback and reflection. Use of STARS 
assessment, VOYAGES South Diagnostics, SKEDULA, and The NYS Regents data to improve instructional outcomes and 
timely alignment of curriculum to NYS Standards 
5. Create a system of quarterly benchmarks that focus on predetermined skills for the ELA department. Benchmarks 
will assess identified skill gaps. The ELA department will identify skill gaps using both formative and summative data. 
Skills will be aligned to the NYS Standards and provide students who show satisfactory work a ladder of skill building 
whose end result is to be better prepared for College. 
6. Develop an ELA curriculum that is skill based, engaging, and differentiated for transfer high school students of 
varying reading levels. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

By June 2018 all subject area teachers will have been supported by professional development in the area of 
curriculum design that is aligned to key NYS standards. Professional Development will continue to center on the 
creation and implementation of rigorous high school curriculum focused on key skills using school wide 
instructional strategies and best practices. All curriculum will include embedded skill based strategies in all 
subjects that assess reading and writing, supporting student development in critical thinking and deep analysis 
of materials. This annual goal consists of four equally dependent parts 
1. Continued implementation and adjustment of all curriculum with benchmark assessments that are skill based 
and standards aligned for each trimester beginning in October 2018.  
2. Continued creation and implementation of full trimester Units of Study in all disciplines. This alignment will 
include the identified school wide shift towards increasing literacy across all subject areas and both 
argumentative and evidence based writing. 
 
3. Continued implementation and adjustment of an Integrated Algebra curriculum with benchmark assessments 
that are skill based and NYS Standards aligned for each trimester beginning in September 2018.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Through the implementation and creation of a clear 
professional development plan, all teachers will engage in 
professional development sessions that meet the needs of the 
whole school as evidenced by increased student achievement. 
Individualized professional development plans for teachers that 
highlight steps for support and progress will be created through 
conferencing, which will be conducted at least once per 
semester during which teachers along with administrators will 
set SMART and achievable professional goals. In addition 
teacher developed and facilitated Professional development will 
continue throughout the year based on conferencing, subject 
team’s needs assessments and administrative 
recommendations. 

Teachers will receive ongoing support to assist them in 
designing curriculum that is rigorous, engaging and relevant to 
students’ lives through subject team planning sessions, work 
with re-Design for Schools, and weekly professional 
development. Teachers will engage in professional development 
around the use of data protocols and SWP. Teacher teams 
within departments will engage in collaborative inquiry through 
the development of Critical Friends Groups, Student Work 
Protocols to ensure that curriculum is rigorous, in alignment 
with the NYSLS and school wide best practices are shared. 

Weekly, teacher teams will collaborate to share and analyze 
lesson unit plans and discuss how to deepen reading, writing 
and literacy tools to strengthen students’ abilities to use textual 
evidence in writing and discussion. Teacher teams will work 
within the identified school wide and subject shifts to align 
curriculum with the NYSLS. Teachers will engage in inter-
visitations of classes guided by an approved student work 
protocol that will be implemented to ensure tasks are aligned to

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Families are supported through an ongoing cycle of communication. Engagement in their understanding of rigorous 
instruction is accomplished through the following systems: 

 

1. Families attend orientations, counseling sessions and workshops. 

2. Families are apprised of student academic progression through marking period and trimester progress reports. 

3. Families are engaged through a school newsletter. 

4. Families attend individual academic counseling sessions with their students. Sessions include advocate counselors 
and teaching staff. 

5. Transparent system of providing credit accumulation information. All information provided at the end of each 
marking period and trimester. 

6. Teaching staff maintains consistent contact with parents. This contact includes phone conferencing on a weekly 
basis that is prioritized according to academic goals, credit accumulation, and attendance. In addition, weekly time is 
set aside for STAC (Student Teacher Advocate Counselor) meetings that include parents offering families an 
opportunity to communicate with teaching staff.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Building upon our 2017-18 CEP Goal, VOYAGES South will 
continue to support student achievement through our Accelerate 
program and partnership with Queens Community House by 
creating meaningful relationships between staff and students. 
2018 Accelerate program will be a workshop based model where 
students will pick from offerings such as photography, karate, 
weight training, bicycle repair and other activities. The vision for 
this new program is to engage at risk youth with real world 
experience driven classes. The program will mimic that of 
choosing electives in college. In addition, Accelerate will also 
include two groups devoted to both our young men and young 
woman that will meet each day in an effort to improve and 
continue a school wide restorative approach of support. 

Continued implementation of potential CTE Program for 
Construction Arts. Program will work to satisfy new NYS Regents 
Diploma requirements by substituting one NYS subject area 
Regents with certified CTE Test. In addition, program will focus 
on at risk young men who have expressed interest in learning 
trades such as carpentry, electric work, cabinetry, OSHA 
Certification, wiring, and general contracting. Funds from 
possible grants will supplement costs of machinery and 
maintenance. 

The CBO Director, Principal, Administration, and School Social 
Worker will align services of all components for academic, social, 
and emotional support at VOYAGES South to effectively engage 
students. Administration team will conduct weekly meetings to 
discuss, outreach, data, and coordination of services. Continued 
creation of programs and incentives that will effectively engage 
students and parents. Continued regularly scheduled home 
visitations by advocate counseling staff to at risk students. At the 
end of every marking period we will conduct a data analysis for 
impact.

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Committed to the belief that all students can learn at high levels, VOYAGES South believes that in order to achieve 
college and career readiness, students must engage in and demonstrate evidence of inquiry-based learning, 
classrooms must be student centered, including differentiated instruction evidenced by alternative groupings in the 
classroom, and daily writing and end of semester projects must be aligned to the NY State Learning Standards.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy 
is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. VOYAGES South 
Queens, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support 
of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents 
informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. 
Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I 
Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[VOYAGES South Queens will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress;

improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess early literacy skills of ELL students, our school uses the language placement exam and quarterly assessments to 
gauge student understanding.  Students are administered the language placement exam at the beginning of each year to 
determine their reading level.  The placement exam is designed to determine where to begin instruction within the 
language program. Quarterly assessments are administered at the end of each unit to determine student progress. These 
assessments are created by our teachers and designed to address specific skill targets in comprehension, analysis and critical 
thinking. Teachers collect data from ATS to gather NYSESLAT scores. Thus far the data suggests that ELLs listening, speaking, 
reading and writing scores from the NYSESLAT results from the previous year are reflective of their diagnostic scores from the 
beginning of the school year. The data provides insights into the appropriate levels for instruction as well as strategies to 
implement with these students to improve in the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

collect quantitative data to drive instruction, this data is used by our ELL support team and content-area teachers to 
differentiate instruction for whole class instruction, small group instruction and one to one support. To further support our 
ELLs, our school will perform varied assessments periodically to track student progress and to further support early literacy 
skills. Our lesson planning framework is designed to implement effective ELL strategies to meet the needs of those learners.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers will review and analyze formative assessment data during common planning times, 3 days per week. Access to 
school-wide data will be reviewed and analyzed during professional development meeting times, 2 days per week. During 
those meetings and the use of the data inquiry cycles, all teaching staff will review student data by using the student work 
protocol. Upon review of the data, teachers will note student misconceptions and begin to address students' problems of 
practice through strategic instructional practices and implementation of various reading and writing strategies in an effort to 
improve literacy and math skills.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
As noted by our academic notable gains, our ELLs received academic success in our targeted intervention programs across all 
content areas. Teachers collaborate during subject teams to construct and revise instructional plans to provide ELL academic 
support for, but not limited to, curriculum based performance tasks, Regents preparedness, and other targeted needs during 
the instructional day.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers will review and analyze summative assessment data during common planning times, 3 days per week. Access to 
school-wide data will be reviewed and analyzed during professional development meeting times, 2 days per week. During 
those meetings and the use of the data inquiry cycles, all teaching staff will review student data by using the student work 
protocol. Upon review of the data, teachers will note student misconceptions and begin to address students' problems of 
practice through strategic instructional practices and implementation of various reading and writing strategies in an effort to 
improve literacy and math skills.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Applicable for grades K-5.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The students at Voyages are students who have transferred from other NYC traditional high schools and therefore we do not 
administer the LAB-R to our incoming ELL students. We make every attempt to obtain the student's records from his/her 
community school. Our students receive notable academic gains when given multiple exposure to literacy classes and 
additional English Language Arts support for more than one trimester. Further, our ELLs have demonstrated academic 
achievement on Regents scores and credit accumulation as supported by their ELA classroom setting.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The administration team will review and analyze outcome assessment data and ATS reports to evaluate and inform our ELL 
programs. Upon review of the data, we will make the necessary program changes to address students' needs and eligible 
services offered.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1.  a.  VOYAGES South High School will implement a Small Group ELL Instructional Program/Freestanding ESL from 
10th -12th grade.  Students are organized by proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)  and receive ESL 
services in a push-in model.  The primary goal of our ELL program is to foster full English Proficiency in a supportive 
risk-free classroom environment as well as to: expand literacy and academic language and provide students with skills 
that will allow them to perform at city and state grade level in all  subject areas 
  
b. The ELL program at VOYAGES South High School will provide courses that meet the state requirements for ELL 
programs.  Students are grouped for their ELL services homogeneously according to their proficiency levels as 
indicated on either the LAB-R or NYSESLAT examination.  
  
Freestanding ESL programs are offered in a push-in model.  The ESL teacher meets with ELL students in the general 
education setting.  ELL students who are also identified as special needs students receive push-in and Integrated Co- 
Teaching services for core-subjects.  Beginner students receive additional literacy instruction. 
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   
Not applicable at this time.    
c.  DL program.  If applicable.    
Not applicable at this time.    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
Free-standing ESL programs are offered in a Block Schedule.  Beginner ELL’s receive 540 minutes a week, intermediate ELLs 
receive 360 minutes of service a week and Advanced ELLs Receive 180 minutes per week.  Students are grouped based on 
proficiency levels.  Students are graded individually based on Common Core Learning Standards in conjunction with a teacher 
designed grading scale. 
a.  The goal of our ELL program is to foster full English proficiency in a supportive risk-free environment.  Both the English 
Language Arts (“ELA”) and ELL teacher that work with ELL students are certified.  In order to help students progress, we use 
the following practices: 
•Collaborative Planning and/or Conferencing with Content Area Teachers 
•Utilization of different strategies: Scaffolding, Modeling, Schema Building, Contextualization, Text Representation and Meta 
cognition. 
•Assisting students during work periods, conferencing with students in and out of class and informal assessments 
•Communication and collaboration with parents 
•Creating goals for students in which they monitor their progress in each of their courses 
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
VOYAGES South High School will have a Freestanding ESL Program.  Supplemental materials for the ESL program include a 
comprehensive literacy program, including instructional resources and elements that apply specifically to ELLs and inherently 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

prepares ELLs to meet standards.  
Aside from English language instruction, students receiving ELL services are able to receive support in all content areas during 
their ELL services.  The teacher is able to work with students on challenges arising in English, Social Studies, Math and Science 
during their mandated services.  
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year by accommodating ELLs with 
bilingual dictionaries and glossaries and assessments translated in their home languages.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
a. Students with Interrupted Formal Education (“SIFE”) are placed into ELL programs in accordance with most recent LAB-R 
results or NYSESLAT Results.  In addition to ELL, students have access to support services that help transition into high school 
(i.e. Academic Intervention Services or Counseling). 
b. Beginner ELLs receive 540 minutes of ELL services per week.  Beginner ELLs (1-3 years) are provided three 90 minute ELL 
classes per day.  Beginner ELLs are taught in small self-contained classes, homogenously grouped according to proficiency 
level. Instruction for Beginner ELLs is aligned with Common Core ELA Standards and New York State ELL Standards.  Students 
are provided instruction in reading, speaking and writing from the certified ELL teacher.  To incorporate the state standards for 
ELA content, the ELL teacher meets with ELA teachers in a Professional Learning Community and for common planning three 
days a week. 
  
c.  Intermediate ELLs (4-6 years) receive 360 minutes of ELL instruction per week.  Students are placed in 90 minute block 
classes that meet daily in a self-contained setting. Students are programmed for small group instruction and are placed in 
homogenous groupings based on proficiency level.  Instruction for ELLs is aligned with ELA state standards and New York State 
ELL Standards. 
  
d.  Long Term ELLs (6+ years) receive 180 minutes of ELL services per week.  Students are programmed for 1 45 minute class 
each day.  Instruction is delivered in a small group from a certified ELL teacher.  Students are placed into homogenous groups 
based on proficiency level. 
  
e. Students who have placed out of ELL as per their NYSESLAT results are integrated into general education 
classes.  Students have access to support from the ELL teacher or other school personal as needed.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Currently, we have not placed any ELL-SWDs at this time. If the demographics shift in the near future we would provide those 
students with grade-level materials and instructional strategies to access academic content areas and accelerate English 
language development. This would include, but not limited to: flexible groupings, extensive vocabulary building, and use of 
visuals and graphic organizers across all content areas. Special educators work closely with the ELL teacher to ensure that the 
needs of ELL students with special needs continue to be met.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Currently, we have not placed any ELL-SWDs at this time. If the demographics shift in the near future we would program ELL-
SWDs into integrated co-teaching classes for specific content areas as well as environments that provided for extra support to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

meet the students diverse needs and provide them with the necessary support to enable them to function with their peers in 
the least restrictive environment. The ELL teacher will work closely with the Special Education department to ensure that ELLs 
with IEPs are able to achieve their IEP goals.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas include before and after-school school 
academic intervention services. All content area teachers use reading and writing strategies to address achievement gaps. We 
have one certified Special Education teacher on staff who has worked with ELLs previously. Additional related service providers 
are available through referral from our CBO partner, Queens Community House. Students receive additional support to meet 
and exceed standards, Regents prep and other exam preparation during the instructional day.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, we are not planning any changes in our program for ELLs because we have a small population of 
ELL learners. If the demographics of our school change, and more ELL students enroll, we will make changes to meet the needs 
of those students. If necessary, we would consider expanding our ELL services by hiring a full-time ESL specialist and creating a 
self-contained ESL class.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued at this time.     
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Students receiving ELL services are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Students receiving ELL are mandated to 
attend AIS after school. Students also are provided equal access to all elective courses.  Additionally, students are additionally 
encouraged to participate in school extracurricular activities, including sports teams and clubs. Former ELL's are provided with 
accommodations per parental and principal requests. ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs and 
services. Students are invited to all school programs, invitations and postings are presented to each student. All school support 
structures are available to our ELLs: media center, school library, before and after-school tutoring, and extracurricular 
activities. In our building we have a community based organization,  Queens Community House, which offers students an 
opportunity to participate in an external internship experience. Our school goal is to enrich each student's educational and 
social experience providing them with opportunities to participate in meaningful activities that increase student engagement 
in school, which ulitmately leads to improved students outcomes and higher levels of success in high school and beyond. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Students receiving ELL services will have access to a comprehensive literacy program.  Language! is a comprehensive literacy 
program by Sopris West.  The program focuses on phonemic awareness, morphology, reading comprehension, spelling, 
grammar and writing skills.  In addition, computers are available in the ESL classroom for students use.  Laptop carts and 
Smartboards are also available for classroom use. 
    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

At this time, our students attending our freestanding ELL program prefer instruction to be delivered in English.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All mandated services meet the emotional, social, academic-grade and age level- needs of all ELL students.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Students receiving ELL services use a literacy program called Language! and EDGE.  Language! is a comprehensive literacy 
program by Sopris West.  The program focuses on phonemic awareness, morphology, reading comprehension, spelling, 
grammar and writing skills.  In addition, computers are available in the ESL classroom for students use.  Laptop carts and 
Smartboards are also available for classroom use. 
    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELL students have the opportunity to receive additional support before, during and after school. Voyages staff 
are also available during lunch hours. Our school offers small group instruction which focuses on Regents Prep or any other 
academic needs of students in attendance.  ELL students are provided with access to online sites and academic support from 
ELL teacher.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish and Italian are offered as an elective for all students at our high school.  Spanish instruction is offered for levels 1-
6.  Instruction is provided by a native Spanish speaker who is also fluent in English.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable at this time.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ELL provider is able to attend professional development workshops offered by the New York City Department of 
Education.  In addition to outside professional development, school based professional development is offered to teachers 
once per week.  Administrators, teachers, and support personnel deliver professional development on various topics.  All 
VOYAGES  South High School staff members receive PD during faculty conferences on site and specific domain of teaching off 
site as well. 
The professional development that is offered to teachers in supporting ELLs as they participate in TSI, transfer school institute, 
which includes one-to-one direct coaching, monthly workshops, and Saturday professional development seminars throughout 
the school year. The specific activities offered are to develop rigorous instruction and assessments aligned to standards. 
Through the workshops teachers design and norm rubrics, assessments, develop instructional strategies and tools for giving 
feedback to students, and create a tool to track student's progress in skills and academic behaviors.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Voyages South is a transfer school, students must complete 9  th grade at the community/traditional high school before 
attending our school. None of our students are transitioning from middle to high school.  
The pedagogue responsible for ELL services provides an annual Professional Development intended to inform staff of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

needs and progress of ELL students.  The ELL service provider also is a part of the English Department content team.  Records 
are maintained in a locked file and updated as required per DOE request. 
Additionally, the ELL teacher works very closely with the Special Education Department.  The Special Education Department 
has delivered various Professional Developments for staff members in conjunction with the ELL teacher.  Content of the 
workshops focused on differentiating instruction for diverse groups of learners.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs are scheduled throughout the school year. For families who prefer a translator 
to be present, if a Voyages staff member is not available or unable to translate the language access coordinator will arrange for 
a translator through the translation interpretation unit. At these yearly conferences, the student's core content teachers, 
advocate counselors, and family sit to discuss the goals of the program, the student's language development progress, and the 
student's language proficiency assessment results.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Upon entrance into the school system, ELL Parents are given the HLIS.  If students are eligible for ELL services, parents are 
informed of instructional models for ELL.  Parents of students already receiving ELL instruction are contacted by the school 
establish communication and describe what services will continue to be delivered.  
Twice a year, VOYAGES South hosts a parent-teacher night.  Parents are able to conference with teachers and administrators 
during this time.  Invitations for conferences are available for parents in native language.  Bilingual staff members are 
additionally available to translate at parent teacher conferences.  Additionally, all parents are also invited to attend school PTA 
meetings.   
To provide full disclosure of student performance, VOYAGES South uses Skedula.  Parents, teachers and students have access 
to information on Skedula.  Teachers post attendance, grades, assignments and anecdotal accounts that are available to 
parents and students alike.  VOYAGES South High School provides training on this program to parents and students.  Bilingual 
staff members are available to translate and communicate information to parents.  
Throughout the school year, teachers maintain continual communication with parents to ensure that students’ needs are 
met.  Bilingual staff members are available for translations at both informal parent/teacher meetings and IEP meetings for 
students who are receiving additional services in Special Education.  Parents of ELLs are given invitations to 
workshops.  Parents are invited to join the school leadership team and participate in the Mock Quality Reviews.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christopher Losurdo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When students register in our school, our intake team (administrator, dean, teacher, secretary, parent 
coordinator, ESL specialist, IEP specialist, and advocate counselor) reviews student information in paper and 
electronic form (student records; ATS reports) and conducts an informal interview with each family. During the 
interview, parents are asked if they have previously filled out a Home Language Identification Survey. If there is a 
Home Language Identification Survey in the student folder, we follow the parents' request for language in which 
to receive school communications. If they have not filled out the HLIS, we give it to them during the interview. We 
have staff members who speak Spanish who are available to help translate as needed.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
