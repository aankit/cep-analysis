Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

coaches for Core Curriculum in ELA and Math. Pedagogical teams allow teachers to consistently evaluate teacher 
effectiveness and drive instruction. Administrators, coaches and teachers together guarantee continuous 
accountability for effective instruction and student achievement.  

  
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Seventy one (71) of the students are English Language Learners and 94 are special needs students. Sixty seven (67) of 
the English language learners speak Spanish as their native language. None of the students are considered students 
with interrupted formal education (SIFE). Sixty nine (69) of the 71 students are English language learners for 0 to 3 
years. Eighteen students (18) are in the entering level of English language proficiency, twenty three (23) students are 
in the emerging level, eighteen (18) students are in the expanding level and twelve (12) students are in the 
transitioning level. Students with special needs are serviced in 5 self-contained special education classrooms in 
kindergarten through fifth grade and in two collaborative teaching classrooms in pre-kindergarten and in 
kindergarten.  

 
4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The three elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which the school made the most progress over the past 
year are: 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

a) Rigorous Instruction 

b) Collaborative Teachers 

c) Trust 

New systems that supported teacher collaboration and professional growth were implemented throughout the school 
year. These included: 

-School leaders communicated a clear vision to all stakeholders, collaborated on developing a mission statement built 
around Advanced Literacies and related Hallmarks 

-Provided parents with a series of workshops designed to improve their understanding of the instruction delivered to 
their children along with strategies for supporting this learning at home 

-Provided additional time for teacher collaboration in order to create Common Core aligned instruction 

-Developed team leaders for literacy and math on each grade level to guide this work, support their colleagues, and 
serve as a communication liaison between teachers on the grade level team and school leaders 

 

Based upon the data provided from the Quality Review (QR) and NYC School Survey as well as student assessment 
data, the school has identified two areas of focus within the Framework for Great Schools for this current school year: 

1) Rigorous Instruction 

2) Strong Family Community Ties 

Student assessment data, in particular data gathered from the NYS tests, i-Ready diagnostic assessments, and DRA 
benchmarks, shows a deficiency in vocabulary that prevents students from achieving proficiency in both literacy and 
mathematics.  

Data gathered from the NYC School Survey demonstrates a need to improve ties to the community. School leaders, 
teachers, and parents will collectively gather ideas to support stronger parent engagement and community 
involvement. 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

Provide time for collaboration and use of data.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.

rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

The school has made significant progress in terms of developing and ensuring that unit and lesson plans used include 
data-driven instruction and are appropriately aligned to the CCSS (3.3) through systems described below; 

  Provided additional time for teacher collaboration in order to create Common Core aligned instruction 
  Developed team leaders for literacy and math on each grade level to guide this work, support their colleagues, 

and serve as a communication liaison between teachers on the grade level team and school leaders 

  A combination of formative and summative assessment data (i.e., on-demand writing baseline and progress 

monitoring assessments) analyzed at the team level indicate an increase in students meeting the target 
standard for the unit after Common Core aligned instruction had been delivered.  

Needs 

According to the Quality Review (QR), teaching practices are becoming aligned to the curricula. Teaching practices 
reflect a set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the Danielson Framework for Teaching and the 
CCSS instructional shifts.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

However, student assessment data reveals deficiencies with acquisition of vocabulary and academic language.  

 

 

i-Ready diagnostic assessments given at the end of the 2017-18 school year indicate that students need to 
develop their vocabulary. 
In addition, while NYS testing data shows an increase in the number of students reaching proficiency levels in 
ELA and mathematics as compared to the previous school year, a large number of students (36% in ELA and 50% 
in mathematics) still fall below grade level standards (Levels 1 and 2). 

  The majority of the students performing below grade level standards, in particular far below grade level 

standards (Level 1), in both ELA and mathematics were identified as ENLs or SWDs on the 2017-18 NYS Exams. 
For example, 90% of SWDs were not proficient in mathematics on the 2017-18 NYS Exam. 

Based on the above student assessment data and a review of the most current qualitative and quantitative data, we 
have identified the need for teachers to provide explicit and improved instruction in the area of vocabulary acquisition.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will embed research-based strategies for improving vocabulary and language acquisition into 
daily instruction, resulting in a 10% increase in overall proficiency levels for all students including SWDs and ENLs as 
measured by a comparison between i-Ready diagnostic baseline and end of the year assessments.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

Strengths: 

  Teachers support students to address their socio-emotional needs through literature and discussion.  
  Monthly character trait (i.e., honesty, kindness, etc.) is focused on through the book-of-the-month initiative and 

 

monthly assemblies led by the guidance counselor. 
School counselor meets weekly with small groups of at-risk students to address their social and emotional 
needs. 

  PBIS is implemented school-wide. Students and classes receive coins and rewards for positive behaviors 
exhibited. The same set of positive behaviors is displayed and reinforced throughout the school building. 
Student council members work with the guidance counselor to create systems for a supportive learning 
environment for students. 

 

  The Playworks Program develops peer leaders to teach students how to play cooperatively and how to support 
one another socially and emotionally (i.e., need to feel safe, need to feel supported, need to make friends and 
cultivate positive relationships). 

OORS data suggests that the systems above are effective in creating a more supportive learning environment for 
students. In 2017-18, there were 35 incidents reported in OORS, down from 46 in 2016-17, 48 in 2015-16, and 80 in 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          20 

 

2014-15. This decline in OORS incident reports suggests that PBIS has been particularly effective in creating a supportive 
learning environment, as this system was implemented in 2015-16. 

Needs:  

In order for our strategies and practices to align with the tenets and statement of the practice above, we must further 
encourage teacher participation and voice in the existing structure of the PBIS Committee meetings. The school 
counselor in collaboration with other school personnel will use data to discuss students' socio-emotional needs,

4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by 
using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures, 
and progress monitoring). 
Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

 

Increased time for professional collaboration, particularly on the grade team level has resulted in: 

-Analysis of student work using the "Santa Cruz" model in order to plan and differentiate instruction for a variety of 
learners 

-Development of unit and lesson plans aligned with CCLS and instructional shifts in order to increase student 
achievement 

-Cycles of lesson study and inter-visitation that improve pedagogy through highlighting best practices 

  Continuous reflection and collaborative structures between principal and staff lead to a successful evolution of 

priorities 

 

Needs:

  Opportunities to collaborate must have an increased focus on embedding research-based strategies for 

vocabulary acquisition into daily instruction as this has been identified as an area for improvement based upon 
the data previously cited in Section 1B. Furthermore, data from Advance indicates that there is a need to 
improve in 3c (Student Engagement). Teachers must collaborate to develop tiered tasks with multiple entry 
points for all learners.  

  According to the 2017-18 Summative Feedback from the Superintendent's Office, the school needs to improve 
the coherence of instructional practices to ensure the provision of scaffolds and extensions to learning so that 
all students are met at their respective entry points, which will enable them to participate in meaningful 
academic tasks of suitable challenge and increasing cognitive capacity, leading to mastery of grade level 
standards and ownership of their learning.  

  Analysis of student work needs to be a well-embedded practice within the school. 
  Continue to promote dialogue among teachers so that they can learn best practices from each other. 
  Teachers' pedagogical practice and school leader vision can be more consistently aligned. 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 360, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 360 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, 
communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of 
the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy 
with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

●engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly 
to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

●ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

●maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The 
Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each 
month and file a report with the central office.; 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accoountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report;  

●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections 
under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

●schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or 
evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow 
parents to provide suggestions; 

●translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

●conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 360, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

The direct instruction supplemental  program will consist of an ENL after-
school program.  During the school year 2017-2018 our ENL students did not perform well on 
the ELA and Math state tests. The state tests data shows that 70% of our ELLs scored level 1  on 
the ELA State Test and the majority of our ELLs  scored level 1 on the Math State Test. In 
addition, the 2018 NYSESLAT Exam History Report shows that even though our students made 
progress in English language acquisition, only 17 students or 18% achieved proficiency.  Since 
the start of the 2018-2019 school year, 35 newly admitted students have been given the 
NYSITELL. Of those 35 students, 19 were identified as ELLs. Most of these students are at the 
Entering and Emerging levels, with a few students not able to answer any question in English. 
The 2018 NYSESLAT results show that out of 71 English Language Learners, 8 students or 
11% scored Entering, 26 students or 8% scored Emerging, 14 students or 20% scored 
Transitioning, 26 student or 37% scored Expanding, and 17 students or 24% scored 
Commanding. Overall, the students performed better in Listening and Speaking modalities than 
in Reading and Writing.   
As a result, three ENL certified teachers, Mrs. Perez-Ortiz, Ms. Vitez, and Mr. Silverio will teach 
an ENL after-school program that provides direct instruction in English.  Teachers will provide 
instruction in social studies while using ENL methodologies to support students' language needs. 
Through the content/ENL instruction, we will support  students by providing assistance in the 
four modalities.  
 
-Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served: 
P.S. 360 has 82 English Language Learners. Students in grades 3, 4, and 5 will be invited to 
participate in the program. The ENL after-school program is targeting the transitioning and 
expanding students in order to help them improve their language skills while learning the content 
area. The following students will participate in the after-school program: 
14 transitioning students, 15 expanding students, and 4 students with disability  
There will be three groups in total: 
Mr. Silverio, ENL certified teacher, will work with transitioning and expanding fifth grade 
students in room 422.  
Ms. Vitez, ENL certified teacher, will work with transitioning and expanding third grade 
students in room 315.  
Mrs. Perez-Ortiz, ENL certified teacher, will work with transitioning and expanding fourth grade 
students in room 410. The ratio of teacher to students will be approximately 1 to 10. 
 
-Schedule and duration: 
The ENL After-School Program will meet two days per week on Wednesdays and Thursdays for 
one hour and 10 minutes each day from 2:25pm to 3:35pm. The program will start on 
Wednesday, October 10, 2018 and it will end on Thursday, April 25, 2019. In addition, there will 
be several trips to plays, museums and other cultural and historical centers which will take place 
mostly on Saturdays.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 
-Language of Instruction: The language of instruction is English using ENL methodologies. 
 
-Number and types of certified teachers: 
Three ENL certified teachers:  Mr. Silverio,  Mrs. Perez-Ortiz, and Mrs. Vitez
                                                                   
 
-Types of materials: 
The materials that will be used are distinct from those used for daily instruction. 
On Our Way to English, Houghton Miffin Harcourt 
Discussions 4 Learning: An Oral Vocabulary and Language Program, purchased from Davis 
Publications. 
Every classroom has multiple computers and iPads and teachers have access to our laptop carts. 
In addition, each of these classrooms is equipped with a Promethean board. Students will further 
their reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills in the classroom using books and materials 
that are aligned to the New Common Core Learning Standards. 
 
-Activities: 
Through the ENL program "On Our Way to English" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 
students will be engaged in activities that are aligned to the NYS Common Core Standards. 
Teachers will work together to create lessons that target the modalities of listening, reading, 
writing, and speaking. We will select engaging texts, allow time for rich discussions, and select a 
small set of vocabulary words  to build knowledge. In addition, lessons will incorporate writing 
assignments that require students to use vocabulary words, concepts, and academic language.  
As we use Discussions4Learning, a vocabulary and language program, students will be engaged 
in multiple activities such as oral discussions based on images of fine art and real-world photos, 
writing descriptions, comparing and contrasting various images, conducting further research in 
order to learn more about the images, and preparing oral presentations. Students will also 
practice identifying setting and differentiating literal from figurative language. Students will 
learn and practice key informational texts standards by observing, discussing, and writing about 
real-world photos.Through these images, students will be exposed to cultures from around the 
globe and from across time. Our ELLs will participate in activities designed specifically for 
English language acquisition. The questions will be multi-tiered, so that we can provide adequate 
support and challenge for all our ELLs and all lessons will be differentiated. 
As part of our field trips, the ENL after school program will organize field trips to go museums, 
cultural centers, and to shows/plays throughout the school year.  
 
-Record Keeping: 
Each after-school teacher will maintain an attendance folder and our ENL coordinator will 
maintain a Title III/after-school binder where she will keep the monthly attendance for all 
students and all the notification letters, including invitations and permission slips, in parents' 
preferred languages.

The ENL teachers in the after-school program will receive professional development to build 
strategies that are effective for English language learners. Four one-hour sessions will be 
planned.  The teachers will learn methodologies that are effective with English language learners 
and how students can use skills and strategies appropriate to their  level of English proficiency to 
read, gather, view, listen to, organize, and interpret information. Teachers will learn how to 
support students who are learning a content and a new language at the same time. They will be 
able to provide the support  necessary  at the word level, sentence level, and text level for 
students to meet the New NYS Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers will learn 
differentiated scaffolds that are necessary to help make rigorous grade-level curriculum 
accessible to English language learners. Title III funding will be used to pay for the professional 
development that will be offered to ENL teachers.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  
-Rationale: 
One of the parent engagement activities targeted towards parents of Title III students that will 
impact higher achievement for these targeted students will be a parent orientation to inform 
parents about the program and how they can support students. Parents will become familiar with 
the materials that will be used in the program and they will learn how to support their children at 
home. In addition, our ENL teacher and coordinator will offer English classes for the parents of 
our ENL students. Classes will take place on Fridays from 2:25 pm - 3:25 pm. These classes will 
enable parents to better support their children at home. Another parent engagement activity will 
be workshops for the parents of ENL students.  Parents will be engaged in activities designed to 
promote literacy and mathematics at home.  Parents will be introduced to the math and literacy 
skills their children need to know and learn and they will be informed of the math and literacy 
standards.  Parents will learn activities that promote listening skills and how reading, talking and 
playing can help their children succeed in school.  The workshops will be conducted in English 
and Spanish and parents of English language learners in all grades will be invited to attend. They 
will be held during the day and evening hours to make them convenient for parents to attend. 
 
-Schedule and duration: 
Parent Orientation will take place on Friday, November 16, 2018 from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. 
ESL classes for parents will take place every Friday from 2:25 pm - 3:25 pm. Classes will start 
on Friday, October 19, 2018 and they will end on Friday, May 24, 2019. 
Two parent workshops will take place on Monday, February 25, 2019 from 9:00 am - 10:00 am 
and Monday, April 1, 2019 from 9:00 am - 10:00 am.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
-Name of provider: The parent orientation, workshops, and ESL classes will be provided by the 
ENL Coordinator, Mrs. Perez-Ortiz. 
 
-The adult ESL classes will provided by Mrs. Perez-Ortiz on Fridays from 2:25 pm to 3:25 pm 
will be at cost to Title III. 
 
-How parents will be notified of these activities/Translation Needs: 
Parents will be notified via the school parent calendar, flyers, letters, and postings in the parent 
bulletin board and in the school library website in the parents' preferred language of 
communication. 
Our school currently has approximately 90 English language learners and of those 90 students, 
83 have Spanish as their home language. All notices will be sent home in English and Spanish. 
In addition, the person providing the orientation and workshops, ENL coordinator, Mrs. Perez-
Ortiz, speaks Spanish and she will be able to meet the translation needs of most parents of Title 
III students. We also have in-house staff members who speak Russian, Albanian, Arabic, and 
Vietnamese. For languages that we cannot provide translation services for, we will use the 
services of the DOE language line.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Some of the formative assessments we currently use include DRA (English and Spanish), TC writing pre-assessment and post-
assessment, unit tests for all subject areas, portfolio pieces for math, science, social studies, and writing. In addition, teachers 
administer running records to monitor students' progress for reading. Teachers also create checklists to check for 
understanding throughout each lesson taught. We also use the RLAT report to group students by proficiency levels and to 
guide instruction. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers create schedules to administer running records and to confer with students. When teachers confer with students, 
they take notes about students' strengths and next steps to support students. When administering DRA, teachers are not 
allowed to test their own students. Instead, a different teacher from the same grade level administers the DRA for that class. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

The school uses a color coded folder system to maintain students' work for each subject area (including unit tests, 
performance tasks, formative assessments, writing samples, and reading logs).  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Some of the summative assessments include beginning and end of year MOSL. The school also administers a math baseline 
assessment, mid-year and end of year assessment. In addition, teachers administer TC writing baseline and final writing 
sample for each unit of study. Teachers also create project based learning at the end of each unit of study. Based on these 
summative assessments, we identify the areas of needs. Our K-2 students need support in the following areas: phonemic 
awareness, letter identification and letter sound, sentence and paragraph structure, rules of grammar, capitalization, and 
punctuation. Our 3-5 students need support using text evidence, making inferences and drawing conclusions. Students at the 
entering and emerging levels also need support in phonemic awareness, developing academic and social vocabulary, and 
improving decoding and comprehension skills. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The administration provides common preps for grade level teams to meet weekly in order to discuss and analyze students' 
assessments and data.  At these common prep meetings, teachers also discuss interventions needed, they create unit plans, 
and plan lessons together that meet the needs of all the students. 
Teachers collect and analyze data to determine students who are at risk. AIS teachers meet with classroom teachers to discuss 
and create a list of students to provide additional instructional support. Depending on students' needs, AIS teachers pull-out or 
push-in to support students that are at risk. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use data to guide and improve the quality of instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework for 
students in grades K-5. We make sure that our students have quality opportunities to learn and that they are thriving 
academically.  After initial assessments and acquiring the educational history from parents, students are then placed in groups 
with a plan for systematic academic instruction based on the assessment information.  Strengthening classroom instruction 
using the RTI framework is the key to supporting English language learners who are at risk or who are experiencing difficulties. 
During ENL integrated instruction, co-teachers develop lessons around reading fluency by using strategies such as choral 
reading, error correction and word drilling techniques, and pair reading. 
Using Tier 1 model, teachers deliver instruction in small differentiated groups. Teachers service students with high quality core 
instruction utilizing methods of repeated reading including shared reading and reader's theater.  Using Tier 2 model, teacher 
utilize small homogeneous groupings (1:3 - 1:5). Teachers target instruction designed to remediate skills, strategies, and 
learning deficit of identified students. Teachers build on and reinforce Tier 1 instruction. Progress is monitored to ensure 
whether or not the student is making sufficient progress and whether modifications or reductions to the Tier 2 interventions 
are required. Using Tier 3 model, teachers design instruction that is explicit and targeted toward students' specific areas of 
need. Teachers utilize small homogeneous groupings (1:1 - 1:3).  Individualized programs are designed and implemented. 
Teachers monitor progress one per week or every two weeks to examine the rate and level of performance. 
Student progress is monitored and is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, and/or services. 
We also look at other factors to be addressed such as family dynamics, motivation, or health issues to provide appropriate 
support.   
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The school uses the RLAT report, NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math State Test results to create an ENL after school program to give 
additional support to the ELLs in reading and writing. Classroom teachers use the testing data to create small groups and 
provide additional  instruction.  In addition, the data is used by the AIS providers to determine ELLs who are at risk. The ENL 
out of classroom teachers meets with classroom teachers to collaborate and scaffold instruction to support the ELLs in each

proficiency level  inside and outside the classroom when the ENL teacher is not co-teaching. ENL teachers create a schedule to 
group students according to their proficiency levels to provide integrated and standalone instruction. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teachers meet weekly to disseminate these findings to make adjustments to the ENL programs. The teachers analyze 
student work and collaborate with content area teachers in order to meet the needs of all ENL students.  In addition, monthly 
workshops are provided by the ENL coordinator to support the ENL After School Program teachers. The ENL teachers in the 
after school program receive professional development to build strategies that are effective for English Language Learners. 
Teachers learn methodologies that are effective with ELLs and how students can use skills and strategies appropriate to their 
level of English proficiency to read, gather, view, listen to, organize, and interpret information.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school has a Freestanding ENL program which is comprised of content area instruction in English with home 
language support and appropriate scaffolds and an English development component. ENL is delivered through a 
stand-alone model and integrated ENL. In the stand-alone model, students receive instruction in order to acquire the 
English language needed for success in core content classes. In the integrated ENL, students receive core content (i.e., 
English language arts, math, science, and social studies) and English language development instruction from Mr. 
Silverio, an ESOL certified teacher. 
Our program delivers instruction in English with home language support, emphasizing English language acquisition. 
We use a balanced approach to literacy, infusing high-quality ENL methodologies and instructional practices to 
promote academic excellence for our ELLs. Our ENL program adheres to state aligned Common Core Learning 
Standards for all curriculum areas. The organizational model of our ENL program includes one self-contained first 
grade classroom. Our self-contained class is taught by a teacher certified in both ENL and common branches. ELLs in 
this class are grouped together in an ENL class, and stay together for the entire school day and for all content 
instruction. The teacher uses ENL strategies to provide the core content that is taught in mainstream classrooms. Our 
program model for the self-contained classroom is heterogeneous, meaning that the students in the classroom are at 
mixed proficiency levels. As for the ENL integrated and standalone programs, the grouping is mainly based on the 
students’ English proficiency levels and grades. Every effort is made to group students according to their language 
needs and grades so the ENL teacher can push in most of the time. The collaboration is fundamental to plan together 
to benefit the students. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Currently, our school does not offer a TBE program. However, if enough parents select this model in a grade or two 
contiguous grades, we would consider to open a TBE program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our school does not offer a DL program. If enough parents select this model, our school will honor their request. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 
In order to ensure that all students receive the mandated instructional minutes from Part 154-2, our ENL teachers incorporate 
stand-alone and integrated ENL over the course of the day. Entering ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL per week which includes 
one unit of study in ENL and one unit of study in ENL/ELA. Emerging students also receive 360 minutes of ENL per week which 
includes .5 unit of study in ENL, one unit of study in ENL/ELA, and .5 unit that can be stand-alone ENL or integrated 
ENL/content area. Transitioning students receive 180 minutes per week which consists of .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA and .5 
unit of study which can be stand-alone ENL or integrated ENL/content area. Expanding students receive one unit of study in 
ENL/ELA or other content area. Former ELLs continue to receive services for an additional two years. They receive .5 unit of 
study per week (90 minutes) of integrated ENL in ELA or content area. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The ENL program is aligned with English Language arts, content learning standards, and the core curriculum to provide 
continuity of rigorous instruction. In our self-contained classroom, language arts is taught using ENL and ELA methodologies. 
Content areas are taught in English using ENL strategies, while Native language support is provided through various forms of 
literature, visuals, and audio programs. Our pull-out teacher implements the same strategies and works closely with classroom 
teachers to deliver literacy instruction and make content comprehensible to ELLs. Content is made comprehensible for 
students through the use of visuals, Total Physical Response (TPR), songs, poems, realia, Readers’ Theater, small-group 
instruction, contextualized instruction, and other methods and materials. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

If students are entitled to ENL services and their home language is Spanish, they are administered the Spanish LAB and Spanish 
DRA upon arrival. They are also tested in writing, basic math computation skills and word problems. Based on these results, we 
are able to place the students appropriately. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Students with interrupted formal education require our special attention. They are provided with one-to-one academic 
intervention services designed to develop literacy and mathematics skills. There is also an emphasis on exposing them to 
crucial content that they may have missed so that they can begin to build age appropriate core knowledge. They attend after 
school programs, and are recommended for summer school.  In all these programs, scaffolding strategies such as 
contextualization, modeling, and schema building will be used for significant ENL and academic development. In addition, a 
buddy system is created for SIFE students. Another student who understands language and is familiar with classroom routines 
is assigned to pair up with the student.For our newly arrived ELLs who have not had any exposure to the English language and 
whose home language is not Spanish, we instruct them in a small group in English. A buddy system is also created for 
newcomers. Classroom teachers receive professional development and one-to-one support from the ENL teacher on how to 
welcome newcomers and involve them in classroom activities in a variety of ways that, in the beginning, do not require 
language. Newcomers are also given intensive support in their ENL groups to develop basic English language and phonic skills, 
reading comprehension, and math facts. In order to prepare these students for state testing after one year, students in 
newcomer groups are exposed to sample test questions and assessments to familiarize them with the format. In addition, 
instruction for newcomer is aligned with state ELA, math, and content standards. The CR Part 154-2 instructional unit 
requirements for the ENLs are met. The entering and emerging ENLs receive two units of ENL instruction per day, a total 
number of 360 minutes per week. The transitioning and expanding ENLs receive one unit of study per day, a total number of 
180 minutes per week.ELLs that have been receiving services for 4 to 6 years receive tailored instruction based on areas that 
need improvement. The ENL teacher analyzes NYSESLAT scores to determine which modalities need the most focus and works 
with students to develop proficiency throughout the school year so that they are more prepared for the NYSESLAT in the 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

spring. We provide extensive support in reading and writing. We also provide scaffolding strategies to assist them with the 
acquisition of CALP. We also build on students’ schema to enhance their conceptual knowledge and provide opportunities for 
students to extend their learning through extracurricular activities, AIS, and After School Programs.Currently our school does 
not have any Long Term ELLs who have completed 6 years.  If we have Long Term ELLs in the future, they will also receive 
tailored instruction based on their past NYSESLAT scores. They would be encouraged to attend after school programs, and 
would  receive one-on-one support when needed.ELLs who reach the commanding level on the NYSESLAT will receive 
continuing transitional support for the next two years. These students will receive 90 minutes (.5 unit) of study per week of 
integrated ENL in ELA and content area. Former ELLs receive unlimited time during the state ELA, Math, and Science 
assessments.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Students in self-contained special education classes participate in the same curriculum as students in the general education 
classes. Grade-level texts and materials are adapted and modified as needed in order for all students to access the content. For 
example, key vocabulary and concepts are highlighted and front-loaded in the beginning of units so that students are prepared 
when they encounter them in their work. In addition, assessments for special education ENL students are formulated 
according to their language proficiency and IEP goals. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have twelve ENL students in self-contained special education classes: two entering kindergarten student, two second grade 
ELL, four third grade ELLs, and four fourth grade ELL, and one fifth grade ELL. They are taught the same curriculum as the 
general education classes. The ENL teachers utilize integrated and stand alone ENL to deliver instruction that meets the needs 
of the SWDs. In collaboration with the special education teachers, they develop methods for working with the students that 
enable them to cover the necessary content, foster language development, and prepare the students for assessments. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide targeted intervention programs during the day as well as outside the school day. 
 
The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA/Social Studies are as follows: In all classrooms, small group instruction is 
the main intervention used for students struggling in ELA. In ENL self-contained classrooms, all sub-groups are targeted and 
small groups are formed according to proficiency level. Teachers of ENLs in non-self-contained classrooms are informed of the 
proficiency level of their ELLs. The teachers then form small groups using this information by placing ELLs with non-ELLs who 
have similar needs. Small group instruction for ELA takes place during literacy centers and/or independent reading time. The 
focus of these programs depend on the grade and proficiency level of the students. Interventions used include phonics 
development, word work, guided reading using leveled readers, strategies for reading comprehension, vocabulary and writing 
development, and exposure to ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas. 
 
Outside the classroom, we also have AIS teachers who work with K-5 ELLs in all subgroups. AIS teachers focus on phonics, 
guided reading, and vocabulary development. All interventions in ELA/Social Studies are conducted in English with Native 
language support as needed. 
 
The students reaching commanding level on the NYSESLAT are given transitional support during the school day and through 
after school classes. To provide additional testing support, students are also given test modification such as extended time 
(time and 1/2) on the standardized tests. 
 
-Targeted intervention programs for ELLs struggling in Math/Science are as follows: In all classrooms, small group instruction is 
the main intervention used for students struggling in Math. In ENL self-contained classrooms, all sub-groups are targeted and 
small groups are formed according to proficiency level. Teachers of ELLs in non-self-contained classrooms form small-groups 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

for Math by placing ELLs with non-ELLs who have similar needs. Small group instruction for Math takes place during Math 
Centers and the Math Games period. Interventions focus on reinforcing what is being taught in the Unit using manipulatives, 
visuals, charts, and other hands-on activities and experiments. Outside the classroom, we also have AIS teachers who work 
with ELLs in all subgroups. AIS teachers focus on basic math skills, word problem comprehension, and test taking skills. ELLs in 
grades K-2 participate in our Cookshop program with the rest of their class. This is a science rich program that incorporates 
vocabulary development and the five senses through inquiry based activities. All intervention in Math/Science is conducted in 
English with Home language support as needed. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data and trends, some of the improvements that we are considering for the upcoming school year include the 
purchase of a new language program "On Our Way to English" in order to support the entering and emerging students with 
vocabulary development and language acquisition. Our ENL teachers will collaborate with the mainstream teachers regularly in 
order to align ENL instruction with the monthly instructional calendar as a way to ensure that all students are accessing the 
core curricular.  In addition, we would like to improve upon our ENL After School Program by organizing monthly trips. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

The school closed the bilingual program because when the parents completed the Parent Survey and Program Selection Form, 
we did not have the minimum required number of parents who chose the Transitional Bilingual Education program as their 
first choice in two contiguous grades.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs in the building are provided with many opportunities to participate in after school programs and supplemental activities. 
Our school programs include the ENL after school program, the dance program, and the track and field team. All ELLs are given 
the opportunity to participate in these programs. Our ENL after school program is offered to all ELLs in order to provide them 
with additional instructional time. They are grouped together based on their English language proficiency. The program takes 
place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:25 pm to 3:25 pm. It covers all content areas and runs from October to May. Our 
newcomer students participate in activities designed specifically for English language acquisition. The program offers monthly 
trips to students. In addition, our ELLs, along with general education students, are invited to try-out for our track and field 
team. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Students in ENL classes have a variety of resources available for instruction. Bilingual and native language books are purchased 
for our school and classroom libraries. Quality language material books, audio systems, and other teacher resources are 
purchased from specialized vendors such as Hampton-Brown, Attanasio & Associates, Davis Publications, and 
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Every classroom has multiple computers and iPods and teachers have access to our laptop carts, in 
addition to the computers in the library and computer lab. ENL students are provided with opportunities to use language 
focused websites, such as www.starfall.com and kidstuff.com, in order to support their learning. All  classroom have been 
equipped with a Promethean, and our ENL teachers have a Promethean board or access to a Promethean board. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Each classroom in our school has a multicultural corner in which students have access to books in students’ home languages as 
well as bilingual dictionaries and Spanish thesaurus. Home  language support is delivered in our ENL classroom though the use 
of literature, bilingual and picture dictionaries, visuals, and audio programs. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The services we provide, and the materials that we use, help to further develop the English language acquisition and academic 
development of our ELLs. All services and materials are age and grade level appropriate. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In the beginning of the school year, we invite parents to attend orientation workshops to familiarize them with the materials, 
resources and ENL programs. Our ENL coordinator, Mrs. Perez-Ortiz, conducts interviews and offers orientations to inform 
parents of ELLs of the programs offered by the city of  New York. We also have an after school program which was specifically 
created for our ELLs. Classes are taught by three of our ENL teachers, Mr. Silverio, Ms. Perez-Ortiz, and Ms. Vitez and three of 
our content area teachers, Ms. DiMaggio, Ms. Guzman and Ms. Estevez. Our ENL after school programs offers monthly 
educational field trips. Our school counselor reaches out to parents and works with children t hat have been identified. In 
addition, our parent coordinator, Joye Torres,  works closely with parents; she serves as a liaison between parents and the 
school staff and administrators. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do not offer any language electives to ELLs because our students are provided instruction in English. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

At this time, our school does not offer a dual language program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our classroom teachers, specialists, paraprofessionals, and non-pedagogic staff are offered professional development focusing 
on how to differentiate instruction to meet the needs for ELLs and the use of scaffolding strategies to support student 
participation in content areas. These PD sessions take place during Monday faculty staff development. The sessions are run by 
our certified ENL teachers. Educational assistants are provided with professional development right alongside the teachers 
they work with. ENL teachers learn how to facilitate language acquisition in the various proficiency levels: SIFE, entering, 
emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding. Our occupational physical therapist receives PD at a different site. All 
new teachers participate in meetings dedicated to ENL best practices and assessment policies/procedures. In addition, 
teachers are given some insight into the ELL identification and programming processes.  
 
All our classroom teachers receive professional development workshop on ENL techniques where they learn how to identify 
the needs of our ELLs and how to prepare differentiated lesson plans. Classroom teachers use these techniques in order to 
better support the ENL population in our building. Some of the workshops include: Fundamentals of Language Acquisition 
(scaffolding techniques for ELLs, differentiated strategies for all five English proficiency levels), building background, and 
vocabulary development. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

The ENL Team at our school is providing on-site training to all staff members on effective ENL strategies. Over the course of the 
year, all staff will receive a total of 5.5 hours (15% of the total 175 hours) of required ENL training. 
Our ENL teachers are sent to professional development workshops offered by the office of English Language Learners. They 
will receive a total of 17.5 hours (50% of the total 175 hours).  P.S. 360 maintains agendas and attendance sing-in sheets to 
keep records for professional development activities. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to the already existing parent-teacher conferences, our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of 
ELLs to discuss goals of the ENL program, language development progress and language development needs in all content 
areas. Our self-contained ENL teacher and our ENL coordinator are responsible for scheduling these annual meetings which 
can take place during parent involvement day (Tuesdays at 2:20 p.m.). Teachers maintain a log as well as notes which are used 
to support students and to organize workshops for parents of ELLs. Written communication is translated by in-house staff in 
Spanish, Albanian, Russian, Arabic, and Vietnamese. When necessary, we utilize the services of the DOE Translation 
Department. During these annual individual meetings, we use staff members for interpretation and teachers use the services 
of Over-The-Phone Interpretation provided by the Department of Education. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The school promotes parent involvement by providing parent workshops to inform them of the literacy and math skills their 
children are required to demonstrate in order to succeed in school. These workshops are conducted in English and Spanish. 
Many parents attend these workshops, including parents of ELLs. Teachers also meet with parents and communicate with 
them on a regular basis. If necessary, we have many interpreters available within the school to aid in communication. Another 
popular activity is Family Library Access which includes a short mini-lesson. This program is held in the library every Friday from 
2:30 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. Parents are allowed to borrow books and the library has a parent resource room with a parent 
library.  Our librarian also offers reading night six times a year. In addition, the librarian offers a Pre-K literacy family workshop 
twice a year. The school has a P.S. 360 library Facebook group and a Twitter library account which informs parents about 
activities in the neighborhood. It also provides information about reading. Our ENL coordinator, Mrs. Perez-Ortiz, offers an ENL 
class for parents of our ELL population every Friday afternoon from 2:30pm to 3:30pm. In addition, our school has an annual 
ENL multicultural fair where students prepare oral presentations about their cultural background and all parents are invited to 
attend and to work closely with teachers in order to make this fair possible. The ENL teachers offer a NYSESLAT workshop to 
parents of ELLs. This workshop provides parents with tools to support their children at home and prepare for the NYSESLAT. 
Our parent coordinator, Joye Torres, offers Cookshop for parents once a month. She also offers a parenting and bullying 
workshop. We also engage parents in our annual food drive and Our Penny for Patients Drive.

Policy and Reference Guide, I, IRIS ALDEA-POLLACK, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication, 
parents are required to complete the language preference form when they register their children. The language 
preference form indicates which language the parent wishes to communicate orally and in writing. The language 
preferences are entered into ATS. This information is used to provide school staff with the written and oral 
translation and interpretation needs of the parents. The Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) is updated 
frequently. Our school also uses the UPPG report which provides preferred written and oral communication for 
ELLs and Non-ELLs. 

All parent communications are sent out in English and Spanish.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

All parents must fill out two blue Emergency Contact cards at the time of registration: one is kept in the main 
office and the other one is kept in the nurse's office. Teachers and school staff have access to the information on 
the cards. 

We also have in-house staff members who speak Russian, Albanian, Arabic, and Vietnamese. If the home language 
is other than Spanish, Russian, Albanian, Arabic, or Vietnamese, we will contact the Language Line so the staff can 
speak to all parents regardless of the preferred language.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

School staff is always available to translate and interpret as needed. Some of our staff members speak languages such 
as Vietnamese, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, and Spanish. In addition, to ensure that our staff can speak to all parents 
regardless of preferred language, we contact the Language Line to retain the services of an interpreter when a 
parent's preferred language of communication is one of the DOE covered languages. We also hire on-site interpreters 
when it's not a DOE covered language and we don't have in-house staff to help mediate a meeting in the parents' 
preferred language. 

The school provides a list to each teacher which includes their students' names and parents' preferred language and 
contact numbers. It also includes, in BIG BOLD letters, the 1-800-Language Line number so teachers can speak to all 
parents regardless of preferred language. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school will schedule a professional development session during Monday PDs on language access to ensure that all 
staff members are aware of the the Chancellor's Regulations A-663. Our personnel will receive information about the 
DOE's language access resources such as the Language Line and how to use the translation services and the over-the-
phone interpretation service. In addition, a memo will be distributed to all staff members to inform the school staff on 
language access requirements and the different resources available. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Letters in English and Spanish are sent to parents explaining their rights to receive information in their preferred 
language. In addition, a language identification Guide provided by the NYC Department of Education's Translation and 
Interpretation Unit is posted at the security desk. Flyers are also sent and posted throughout the building stating that 
if a parent needs translation services, all they need to do is contact a staff member. The Adult Preferred Language 
Report (RAPL) is used to determine if the translation services of the DOE Translation Department are required. A 
student handbook goes home at the beginning of the school year and parents are required to sign a form stating they 
received the handbook. If parents prefer a language other than English or Spanish, a language not spoken by our 
personnel, or the DOE covered languages, we will notify them of how to access the language assistance for their

language by posting additional signage around the school in the languages spoken by the parents. In addition, the 
school staff will utilize the Language Line to let parents know that they can speak to staff in their preferred language. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P.S. 360 will survey limited-English proficient parents in order to gather feedback on the quality and availability of the 
language services they receive. Our school will schedule a focus group of parents of all cultures and languages 
represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices on communicating with families. The school staff with 
translate the survey into Spanish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Albanian, and Russian. If parents prefer a language not offered 
by the DOE and not spoken by our personnel, our school will hire a translator to translate the survey. The survey will 
also be sent home to all parents who prefer a language other than English.
