Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement 

 

The John Wayne Elementary School is devoted to providing a safe and nurturing environment to encourage 
meaningful learning. Through a collaborative effort, the “team at Public School 380”, parents, staff and administrators 
– is committed to the vision that each and every student can and will meet the highest standards of educational 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

excellence. The students of P.S. 380 shall be successful, lifelong learners prepared for the future. They will be 
empowered to strive for excellence, to love learning, and to maximize their potential by: 

  being provided with a safe and orderly environment in which everyone is respected and encouraged to strive 

to do his/her very best. 

  being taught a multitude of academic and social skills that will enable them to become productive and 

valuable members of our society. 
fostering a strong home/school partnership, thereby enhancing student achievement. 

 
  providing a challenging curriculum to ensure a quality education for all students. 
 
 

addressing the individual needs of all students through differentiated instruction – remedial and enrichment. 
incorporating the arts into the daily educational program, thus encouraging cultural awareness, diversity and 
creativity. 

  extending the use of technology in our daily instructional program to better prepare our students for a 

technologically advanced society. 

  promoting students who are bilingual, bi-literate and bi-cultural through our dual language program 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

John Wayne is an elementary school with 592 students from Pre-K through grade 5. The school population is 
comprised of 20% Black, 71% Hispanic, 8% White, and 1% Asian students. The student body includes 23% special 
education students. Boys account for 51% and girls 49% of the student population. The average attendance rate for 
school year 2017-2018 was 92%. Our school also offers a special education bilingual Yiddish program. The program 
currently has 37 students enrolled.  

 

P.S. 380 is a school deeply committed to creating a safe and nurturing environment that encourages student learning. 
It is our belief that all students can learn and meet the highest standards given the appropriate support. 

 

To that end, our teachers work collaboratively during common preps and after school during teacher team meetings. 
We have always encouraged a strong home/school connection and will continue this practice with many activities 
planned this year.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school has a large Hispanic population (71%). Therefore, our teachers differentiate their instruction to foster 
vocabulary development and reading strategies. In order to improve the reading ability of our students, we have set 
aside a 45 minute independent reading time each morning. It is our hope that this initiative, along with improving 
reading comprehension, will develop a love of reading in our children. Through Professional Learning Teams, we have 
incorporated vocabulary development strategies to help teachers improve pedagogy in the area of literacy 
instruction. Since math word problems offer the greatest challenge to our students, we began and will continue to 
use the Exemplar Problem Solving Procedure. Beginning in the 2018-2019 school year, we will create a Professional 
Learning Team to help incorporate culturally responsive teaching.  

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school is very proud of the work done by our Professional Learning Teams with a focus on Parent Involvement 
and Higher Order Thinking Question Techniques this past year. The evidence of their work is visible in every classroom 
in the school. In order to identify the areas of focus for our professional development for the 2018-2019 school year, 
our teachers participated in a learning walk using the elements of the Framework for Great Schools as the lens with 
which they observed the various classrooms. The areas in most need were identified and will be studied by the 
Professional Learning Teams next school year, and their work will be brought into the classroom once again. 

 

Although P.S. 380 has always had strong collaborative teams, through the work of PLT’s, inquiry teams and learning 
walks this aspect of the Framework has taken on greater significance at the school. As per analysis of our last Quality 
Review and results of the 2017 School Survey, our focus for school improvement is to ensure the systemic 
implementation of rigorous instruction in all content areas.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

  Analysis of Fountas/Pinnell reading levels 
  Results of standardized ELA exams

The overall percent of students scoring at levels 3 and 4 on the NYS ELA exam slightly decreased in 2018 to 50% from 
51% in 2017. Analysis of performance of subgroups scoring at or above proficiency on the NYS ELA (levels 3 & 4) 
helped identify the existing achievement gap between English proficient students, general education students, 
learning English as a new language (ENL) and students with disabilities (SWD).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

  Analysis of teacher referrals of students who require support with social/emotional issues 
  Analysis of OORS reports, including severe incidents requiring outside providers (EMS-Police-ACS) 
  Analysis of administrative time allotted to students with severe social/emotional needs 
  Analysis of safety concerns expressed by teachers and students 

 

One of our strengths is our school-wide initiative in making sure our school is a respect for all school throughout the 
school year. Although we have always had a strong character education program we always look to increase the 
social/emotional support provided to students. For SY 2018-2019, we will be participating in the Leader in Me 
program to promote student leadership in monitoring of academic as well as social/emotional learning. We will also 
implement Therapeutic Crisis Intervention strategies in order to address students with severe social/emotional needs. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in students that report a positive response when dealing with academic and 
social emotional issues as demonstrated by comparison of pre and post survey of the Leader in Me program.

As a Leadership Team, we reviewed parent attendance at school events during the 2017-2018 school year and the 
results of the NYCDOE parent survey. We noted that parent attendance at our school-wide events was exceptional. 
However, parent attendance at our curriculum workshops offered during Parent Involvement Time on Tuesdays was 
minimal. On our 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, 94% of our parents responded positively to questions about 
strong-Family Community Ties. Based on our analysis and discussion, the following goal and action plan has been 
established.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) P.S. 380  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in our school. Therefore, P.S. 380, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. Our school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 
Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, Parent-
Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional 
development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will 
provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend our school and will 
work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also 
maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; and any other topic of parent 
interest/concern  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or 
evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions;

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The CS strategy is integrated into academic instruction through St. Nick's Alliance. Student reading levels have 
increased throughout the 2017-2018 school year and we have positively influenced school attendance, an enthusiasm 
for learning, social-emotional skills, and academic achievement through the following: 

-Instructional Programming during Expanded Learning Time (ELT) with the school teachers- 2 days per week 

-Integrate Leader in Me in ELT 

-Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) during ELT 

-Literacy during ELT 

-Daytime Programming such as: visual arts, digital media, theater, Seeds to Trees (Science), Yoga 

-Transformational coach to address students' social emotional needs 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June, 2019, there will be a 5% increase in students that report a positive response when dealing with academic and 
social emotional issues as demonstrated by an analysis of OORS reports. 

By June 2019, there will be a 3% increase in student attendance as demonstrated by a comparison of end of year 
attendance reports. 

 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?

lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

The principal will work closely with the Lead CBO to support the academic and social emotional needs of the school. 
The principal will meet with the director on a daily basis to talk about individual students on their academic, 
emotional and social outcomes. We will analyze students' reading levels to correlate academic needs to after school 
programming. St. Nick's Alliance will also support P.S. 380 in their initiatives of STEM, Leader in Me, visual arts, digital 
media, theater, and stress management through yoga.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Describe the direct instruction supplemental program here and include the 

rationale 

 
  subgroups and grade levels of students to be served  
  schedule and duration 
 
language of instruction 
  # and types of certified teachers 
 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
  
PS 380 will offer both an after school program and a Saturday program for English Language 
Learners in grades three, four and five. Both programs will focus on literacy and mathematics. 
 The after school program will be scheduled on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:00pm to 
4:00pm from October 16, 2018 - April 17, 2019. There will be 44 sessions. The Saturday 
program will take place from 9:00 am to 12:00pm for five sessions on the following dates in 
2019:  March 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30. 
 All of the students in the after school program are currently at the transitioning and expanding 
levels on the NYSESLAT.  The language of instruction in both programs will be 
English.  However, students’ native languages will be supported through the use of grade level 
books in the native language and bilingual dictionaries. There is one class of students for the 
after school program and two teachers in the classroom: one with ESL certification and one with 
a Common Branch license. The ratio of instructional time for the ENL/ESL teacher and the 
content area teacher will be 50:50. During each session the ESL teacher will meet all groups of 
students for fifty percent of the instructional time. The literacy materials in the after school 
program will be leveled fiction and non-fiction books from Sussman Publishing to be used for 
guided reading; book clubs; independent reading and other literacy activities. Crosswalk Coach 
Plus, ELA from Triumph Learning will also be used. These materials are supplemental to those 
used for daily instruction. For mathematics, teachers will use supplemental materials from Go 
Math as well as Crosswalk Coach Plus, Mathematics, from Triumph Learning, which is distinct 
from materials used in daily instruction. Attendance for this program will be taken by the 
teachers at every class meeting. These records will be located in the main office and will be 
reviewed by the administrator in charge of the program. 
There will be one class of fifteen third graders and one class fifteen of fourth and fifth graders in 
the Saturday program. There will be two teachers in the Saturday Program, one with 
ESL certification and one with Common Branch certification. The Saturday program will use 
Common Core Performance Coach from Triumph Learning for both ELA and mathematics. Both 
of these are distinct from materials used in daily instruction. Attendance for this program will be 
taken every Saturday by the teachers. These records will be located in the main office and will be 
reviewed by the administrator in charge of the program. 
The rationale for these programs is that on the 2016-2017 ELA test, 52% of the schools' English 
proficient students scored at levels 3 and 4 but only 26% ENL students scored at levels 3 and 4. 
PS 380's stated goal on its Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) is to decrease that achievement 
gap by 3% - from 26% to 23%. The program will also include mathematics instruction because 
on the 2016-17 Math exam, 54% of English proficient students scored at levels 3 and 4 while 
only 34% of ENL students scored at the same levels. (From the 2015/16 exams to the 2016/17 
exams, both groups of students increased in overall proficiency levels.)

Begin description here:            
 
Professional development will be provided after school on Mondays from 2:30pm - 3:40pm 
when teachers will work in small groups to look at enhancing instruction for ELLs.  Topics will 
include improving instruction in mathematics for ELLs; planning cross curricular connections; 
and student goal setting and development of strategy based improvement plans in reading. These 
groups will meet in two cycles. The first cycle will occur on the following dates in 2018: 
September 17, 24; October 15, 22, 29; November 5, 19, 26; December 3, 10, 17. It will finish in 
2019 on January 7, 14, 28 and 29. A second cycle will happen on these dates in 2019: February 
4, 11, 25; March 4, 11, 18, 25; April 1, 8, 15, 29; May 6, 13, 20 and June 3, 10,  and 17. Sign-in 
sheets and agendas for these meetings are maintained by the group facilitators who keep these 
records in binders in their classrooms and, also, by the payroll secretary for review by the 
principal. These professional development sessions will be at no cost to the Title III program. 
 Teachers in the Title III program attended professional development sessions at Brooklyn North 
Central Field Support Center: ESL Bootcamp on July 16 and July 17, 2018 from 9am -1pm and a 
Co-Teaching training from August 16-19, 2018 from 9am - 1pm. Records of teacher attendance 
for these meetings are kept by  by the payroll secretary in the main office and, also, by the two 
ENL/ESL teachers in their classrooms. These professional developments are at no cost to the 
Title III program.  
The rationale for this ongoing professional development is that research shows ELLs succeed 
when there is collaboration among ESL/ENL teachers and classroom teachers. The Title III 
program teachers will receive specialized professional development in working with ELLs which 
they will be able to share with classroom teachers. This close communication among their 
teachers will positively impact the progress of ELLs both in the classroom and in the Title III 
programs. 
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

what their children are learning and, also, when parents are involved in school activities.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Schedule and Duration: PS 380 will hold four meetings for parents on Wednesdays from 2:30 - 
3:15 on the following topics: 
 
For parents who children are in the Title III program: 
 
An introduction to the program and its goals; October 10, 2018; providers are two ENL teachers 
 
Family Literacy Day on Martin Luther King Day; January 21, 2019; providers are the principal, 
two ENL teachers and a common branch teacher 
 
All about the new social studies curriculum; March 8, 2019; providers will be an ENL teacher 
and a classroom teacher 
 
All about the science and technology programs at PS 380;  April 3, 2019. Providers will be the 
science and technology teachers as well as an ENL teacher 
 
Parents will be notified of these events through notices sent home in English and parents' home 
languages before each session. Notices include a tear off that allows parents to indicate whether 
they will be able to attend. These notices, agendas for these meetings and sign-in sheets are 
maintained by the ENL/ESL teacher in room 354 and, also, by the parent coordinator. 
Translations for these programs will be provided by bilingual school staff.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 380 assesses early literacy skills of ELLS by administering Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments four times a 
year.  Students are then assigned to guided reading groups based on these assessments. The school also uses weekly,  teacher 
created assessments to assess vocabulary, spelling and reading as well as Dibels Assessments. These results are used to 
provide targeted small group instruction to ENL/ESL students.  Most of P.S. 380's ELLs new admits are in kindergarten and are 
also non-readers.  
Students in the dual language Spanish/English program are assessed in reading using Spanish language Fountas and 
Pinnell reading assessments. They are also assessed using teacher made assessments. In the bilingual special education 
Yiddish/English programs, students' literacy skills in Yiddish are assessed with teacher made assessments. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Student performance data is reviewed by administrators and discussed at grade conference to ensure that student progress is 
monitored and instructional plans are revised as needed.  Administrators also meet individually with teachers to assess 
student progress toward instructional goals. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
First, P.S. 380 looks at the NYSESLAT results to evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs. The school examines the 
percentage of students  attaining proficiency and the percentage making progress from year to year.   In addition, for students 
in the ENL program, the school looks at reading levels and the results of the NY State ELA and Math Tests.  For students in the 
Bilingual Yiddish Special Education Program,  NYSESLAT results as well as Alternate Assessment results  are used to evaluate 
the program's success.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data is analyzed, at risk students are provided with academic intervention by teacher leaders.  Student progress is 
monitored during weekly AIS meetings.  Instructional approach and materials are modified based on student performance 
data.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 380 uses NYSESLAT scores, reading levels, state test results, and teacher made diagnostic assessments to guide instruction 
for ELLs. General Education ELLs students receive Tier I instruction in their classroom, along with ENL/ESL instruction as per 
mandated units.  Teachers focus on one reading and math skill a week, which they then assess. ELL students who are identified 
as at risk based on diagnostic screening measures and classroom assessments are monitored for 5-6 weeks by their classroom 
teacher and ENL/ESL teacher.  Students identified as at risk are then provided with Tier II instruction which consists of small 
groups instruction either within the classroom or in a stand-alone session.  These sessions are for 20-30 minutes 3-5 times a 
week.  Students' progress is monitored monthly.  Students who do not make progress in Tier II  are provided with Tier III 
instruction which takes place in small groups outside the classroom and is provided by trained school personnel such as the 
SETSS teacher.  Sessions are for 45 minutes 4 or 5 times a week.  Progress is monitored once every week or every two weeks.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
For the students at P.S.380 who receive ENL/ESL services,  the results were as follows. All ELLs in kindergarten were newly 
admitted students and thus took the NYSITELL. The majority of these students were at the Transitioning or Expanding 
levels.  In first grade, almost 50% of the students scored at the Expanding Level on the NYSESLAT;  20%  at the Transitioning 
level; and the remaining students at the Entering or Emerging levels.  In second grade, again, 50% of the students scored at the 
Expanding level; aproximately 30% of the students at the Transitioning level; and about 20% scored at the Emerging level.  In 
third grade, about 80% of the students scored at the Expanding Level . The rest  of third grade ELLs were evenly divided among 
the other levels.  In fourth grade, one-third of the students scored at the Expanding level; close to 40 percent at the 
Transitioning level; and the remainder at Entering or Emerging levels.  In fifth grade, 75%  of the students were at the 
Expanding Level; and the rest were evenly divided among the three lower levels. In the Bilingual Yiddish Program, all students 
scored at the Entering Level. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During weekly AIS meetings, assessment results are analyzed by grade facilitators, specialists and administrators to gauge 
student mastery of grade level content and to revise instructional plans if necessary. Assistant principals and grade facilitators 
then use this information to review program adjustments with teachers at grade conferences. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students in the freestanding ENL program are grouped in specific classes across proficiency levels. Entering students 
receive 180 minutes of stand-alone ESL and 180 minutes of integrated instruction.  Emerging students receive 90 
minutes of stand-alone ENL and 270 minutes of integrated ENL.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 
minutes of integrated ENL while commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL. In stand-alone ENL 
classes, students are grouped by grade, but across proficiency levels.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

In the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education Program, students are grouped in classes of two continuous grades.  All 
students received scores of Entering on the Spring 2015 NYSESLAT.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

In the dual language program EP and ENL students are grouped in a self-contained class.  Content is taught in English 
and Spanish on alternating days.  Literacy in kindergarten is taught based on the students home language. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            In the ENL/ESL program ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes are delivered through a combination of integrated and 
stand-alone ENL/ESL periods, according to CR Part 154.   Entering students receive 180 minutes of stand-alone ESL and 180 
minutes of integrated instruction.  Emerging students receive 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL and 270 minutes of integrated 
ENL.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL while commanding students receive 90 
minutes of integrated ENL. In stand-alone ENL classes, students are grouped by grade, but across proficiency levels. Home 
language support is provided through the use of bilingual dictionaries, bilingual and native language books, and instruction 
about cognates and other language similarities and differences. In the Bilingual Special Education Program, all of the students 
scored at the Entering level on the NYSESLAT, so instruction in both languages focuses on language acquisition, life skills, and 
content areas.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Core content in the ENL/ESL program is delivered for Transitioning, Commanding and Expanding students through integrated 
services where the ENL/ESL teacher and the classroom teacher collaborate to both make content comprehensible and foster 
language development.  All lessons are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  Entering and emerging students also 
receive stand-alone ENL/ESL where lessons focus more explicitly on academic language and literacy skills.  Grades K-3 uses 
materials from the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program.  Grades 4-5 uses the Wonders Reading Program as well as 
the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program.  In math, all grades use the Go Math program. The ESL teacher provides 
content area support by planning lessons with the classroom teacher and aligning language objectives with content area 
objectives. The ESL teacher also uses materials to support ELLs provided by the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program; 
the Wonders Reading Program and Go Math.  Core content in the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education  Program is delivered 
primarily through teacher made materials that are in alignment with students' Individual Education Plans and the Common 
Core State Standards.  In the dual language program,  reading and writing in both languages in Grades K-2 is delivered using 
materials from the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program. Core content in mathematics is delivered in both languages 
through the Go Math program. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 In the dual language program, students in grades K and 1 whose home language is Spanish are evaluated using Fountas and 
Pinnell reading assessments and through teacher made materials. In the bilingual special education program, students whose 
home language is Yiddish are evaluated using teacher made materials. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. P.S. 380 currently does not have any SIFE students.  However, if a SIFE student, were to be admitted, they would receive 
small group instruction within the classroom. They would also receive targeted support in learning academic vocabulary and 
study skills.   
b.  Newcomers -  In grades K-3, newcomers receive differentiated instruction through the supports for ENLs present in the 
Teachers' College Reading and Writing Program.  Students in grade K-5 are aided by  strategies and materials for 
differentiation available for ELLs in the Wonders Reading Program.  Newcomers in the Bilingual Yiddish program are first 
taught prereadiness skills in math and reading.  Multisensory approaches and small group instruction allow students to access 
the content areas in English and the native language. 
c. Developing ELLs benefit from guided reading groups in grades K-2 where instruction is differentiated based on reading 
level.  For grades 3-5, supports and strategies for differentiation for ELLs are provided in the Wonders Reading Program. The 
Go Math program used in all grades also provides materials targeted for ELLs.  Students in the Bilingual Yiddish program 
benefit from small group instruction. Their progress is also carefully monitored through teacher made assessments.  
d. P.S. 380 currently has no long term ELL students.  If the school were to have such students, the classroom teacher and 
ENL/ESL teacher would use NYSESLAT and classroom assessment results to determine the students' weaknesses, particularly in 
reading, and would differentiate instructions to address these needs while helping the student to access content at grade 
level. 
e. P.S. 380 differentiates instruction for former ELLs for up to two years after exiting ELL status by having the classroom 
teacher and the ENL/ESL teacher monitor the student's progress to see that the student's literacy skills and understanding 
have continued to remain on grade level.  If these students were found to not be making adequate progress, lessons would 
include strategies to meet their needs.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The school uses a variety of materials and approaches to provide access to academic content and accelerate English language 
development for ELL-SWDs in general education classrooms, ICT classes, 12:1:1 classes, and in our Bilingual Yiddish Special 
Education Program.  For students in the ENL program, the classroom teachers and the ENL teachers plan lessons for ELL-SWDs 
to focus on both content and language objectives.   During integrated periods, the ENL teacher can make the content more 
accessible to students while focusing on increasing language development.  In addition, ELLs-SWDs receive all mandated 
services such as SETSS, speech, and occupational therapy, where providers focus on IEP goals to to help students access 
content and language.The teachers in the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education Program use a variety of multisensory approaches 
and teacher made materials to facilitate their students' acquisition of both content and language.  In additon, technology is 
used to provide support to ELL-SWDs in accessing content areas and accelerating their English language development. 
Teachers plan lessons that utilize laptops and ipads for this purpose. ELLs-SWDs also attend weekly technology classes in the 
school's computer lab.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELLs-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain 
English proficiency within the least restrictive environment through collaboration among classroom teachers, ENL/ESL 
teachers, SETSS teachers and service providers.  Teachers and providers work together to differentiate instruction to allow ELL-

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

SWDs to access both content and language.  P.S. 380 uses a combination of both pull-out services and integrated instruction to 
support ELL-SWDs, according to CR-Part 154 so that they can remain in the least restrictive environment and participate fully in 
schoolwide activities.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and math include support from the ENL/ESL teacher who, along with the 
classroom teachers, focus on a specific reading and math skill each week and then assess these skills. Targeted intervention 
programs in social studies also include support from the ESL/ENL teacher and are based on student performance on weekly 
assessments.  Targeted interventions in science include support from the ESL/ENL teacher in both the content taught in the 
classroom and in the school's standalone science program.  ELLs are identified as needing support in science based on 
assessments given by both the classroom teacher and the science teacher.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The school will implement the Teachers' College Reading and Writing Program in grades 4-5.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs or services for ELLs will be discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs have equal access to all school programs, both curricular and extracurricular.  ELLs participate in science, art, movement, 
technology and gym classes, along with the other students in their classes.  P.S. 380 has dance shows twice a year in which all 
students participate.  The school also has  a future teacher program where fifth graders volunteer during their lunch period to 
help teachers in their classroom.  ENL students are among those chosen for this program.  All students participate in student of 
the month assemblies and the school's Respect for All assembly.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
For the ENL program in grades K-3, ENL students will participate in the Teachers College Reading and Writing program. In 
grades 4-5, students will continue to use the Wonders Reading Program which provides differentiated support for ELLs.  These 
students also complete writing units that focus on a different genre each month.  All students have access to classroom 
libraries and the school library. The Go Math program is used for instruction in all grades.  All students attend a technology 
class in the school once a week where the curriculum includes digital books, Brainpop and teacher made materials and have 
access to Reading A-Z. Both the Wonders Reading program and the Go Math program include Smart Board materials and other 
technology resources.  Classroom teachers and ENL/ESL teachers also plan lessons that allow students to use Ipads and laptop 
computers.  For ENL students, instructional materials include books in the native language and bilingual 
dictionaries.  Also,  ELL/ESL students have access to instructional materials in Spanish provided by both Go Math and the 
Wonders Reading Program.  In the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education Program, teachers use a variety of multisensory 
materials and teacher made materials to support students. These include materials in the home language. 
a) Newcomers use books in their home language when reading independently.  They also use bilingual picture dictionaries; 
notebook dictionaries and electronic dictionaries.  Students whose home language is Spanish are also able to access content 
through the Wonders Reading program and Go Math materials available in that language.  For science instruction, students 
whose home language is science are supported with books in their language; lists of cognates; and bilingual materials created 
by the  
school's science teacher. 
b) Developing ELLs are supported through the use of bilingual picture dictionaries; notebook dictionaries and electronic 
dictionaries. 
They are also provided with lists of cognates to increase comprehension in reading, math and science.   
c) P.S. 380 currently has no long term ELLs in its ENL/ESL program.  However, if the school did have students in this subgroup 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

they would be supported with bilingual dictionaries; teacher created materials; and online resources in reading and math and 
content areas.  Students whose home language is Spanish would receive support using materials for both ELLs and below level 
students provided by the Wonders Reading Program and Go Math.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the ENL program,  home language support is delivered through the use of bilingual dictionaries, bilingual books and books in 
the home language.  In the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education  program both content and language instruction are delivered in 
the home language primarily through the use of teacher made materials.  In the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education Program, 
home language support is delivered through explicit language instruction and incorporated into the content areas.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ELLs are placed in the appropriate grade level according to their age. All required services/resources and support materials 
are aligned to the Common Core Standards for each grade level.   
    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
For the ENL program in grades K-3, ENL students will participate in the Teachers College Reading and Writing program. In 
grades 4-5, students will continue to use the Wonders Reading Program which provides differentiated support for ELLs.  These 
students also complete writing units that focus on a different genre each month.  All students have access to classroom 
libraries and the school library. The Go Math program is used for instruction in all grades.  All students attend a technology 
class in the school once a week where the curriculum includes digital books, Brainpop and teacher made materials. Both the 
Wonders Reading program and the Go Math program include Smart Board materials and other technology 
resources.  Classroom teachers and ENL/ESL teachers also plan lessons that allow students to use Ipads and laptop 
computers.  For ELL students, instructional materials include books in the native language and bilingual 
dictionaries.  Also,  ELL/ESL students have access to instructional materials in Spanish provided by both Go Math and the 
Wonders Reading Program.  In the Bilingual Yiddish Special Education Program, teachers use a variety of multisensory 
materials and teacher made materials to support students. These include materials in the home language. 
a) Newcomers use books in their home language when reading independently.  They also use bilingual picture dictionaries; 
notebook dictionaries and electronic dictionaries.  Students whose home language is Spanish are also able to access content 
through the Wonders Reading program and Go Math materials available in that language.  For science instruction, students 
whose home language is science are supported with books in their language; lists of cognates; and bilingual materials created 
by the  
school's science teacher. 
b) Developing ELLs are supported through the use of bilingual picture dictionaries; notebook dictionaries and electronic 
dictionaries. 
They are also provided with lists of cognates to increase comprehension in reading, math and science.   
c) P.S. 380 currently has no long term ELLs in its ENL/ESL program.  However, if the school did have students in this subgroup 
they would be supported with bilingual dictionaries; teacher created materials; and online resources in reading and math and 
content areas.  Students whose home language is Spanish would receive support using materials in the home language 
provided by the Wonders Reading Program and Go Math.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Parents of newly enrolled ELLs in kindergarten attend a meeting in June to assist parents in preparing their children for 
school.  They also attend kindergarten orientation at the beginning of the school year. In September the school holds a family 
night where parents learn about the curriculum.  In addition, parents of ELLs attend ELL parent  orientation. The Parent 
Coordinator is also always available to answer questions.     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:    
a. The dual language model at PS 380 is self-contained.  EP and ENL students are integrated for the entire 
day. 
b. English and Spanish 
c. The language of instruction is based on alternating days between English and Spanish. 
d. Literacy is taught in the child's home language first (sequentially). 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
On the November 2017, Chancellor's conference day,  all staff will receive professional development on the following: 
a) Revisions to CR Part 154 
b) Language acquisition process 
c) Scaffolding instruction for ELL students 
On the June 2018, Chancellor's conference day, all staff will receive professional development on using student work to make 
curricular and instructional revisions for ELLs for the coming year. 
At grades conferences and inquiry meetings, assistant principals and grade facilitators will provide ongoing professional 
development on how to incorporate scaffolds across content areas for ELLs.  
 Lesson plans with scaffolds for ELLs developed by grade level teams will be collected and incorporated into curriculum binders 
distributed to staff members at the beginning of the school year.  
Sign-in sheets for all meetings and conferences will be collected and reviewed by administrators. 
At least one of  the school's ESL/ENL teachers will participate in professional development sponsored by Brooklyn North 
Teaching and Learning on the Topics aimed at supporting the instructional needs of students. ESL/ENL teachers will also attend 
workshops at Teachers College on scaffolding the reading and writing workshop for ELLs.  The ESL/ENL teachers will then 
turnkey  information to all staff on Chancellor's conference days as well as at grad and inquiry team meetings. 
The school's professional learning teams will be required to discuss/research implications for instructions of ENLs as it relates 
to 
school-wide topics that are listed below.  Teams will be required to devote 15% of their work to developing specific strategies 
to support ELLs in making progress towards grade level standards as part of their monthly agenda.  Weekly agendas will be 
reviewed by administrators. The professional learning teams topics include: 
Creating Higher Order Thinking Tasks in Grades 3-5 
Facilitating Student Discussion to Promote Student Engagement 
Strategies to support ELLs at different stages of learning development

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elsa Nunez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

20% of PS 380’s student population are English Language Learners. The school determines the language spoken by 
each parent by  

using the Home Language Information Survey, where parents are asked in what language they would like to 
receive information from school staff, and in what language they would like to communicate orally with school 
staff. This information is recorded in ATS. The ENL/ESL teachers then create a report that they update regularly 
with the languages parents speak by grade and class. Also parents indicate their preferred language of 
communication on blue emergency cards. One set of these cards is kept by each teacher in their classroom. 
Another set is kept in the main office.  

Slightly more than 15.00% of the school's parents speak Spanish as their first language and 5% speak Yiddish as 
their first language. All parent notices and report cards are sent home in both English and parents’ home

The welcome poster is on display in the front entryway at P.S. 380. The Language ID guide is at the security desk and 
in the main office. The school fulfills Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations regarding parental notification 
requirements for translation and interpretation services by sending home to every parent the Bill of Rights and 
Responsibilities. This document is sent home in English and in Spanish. Translations in these languages are available 
on the New York City Department of education website. Bilingual Yiddish staff provide this information in translation 
to parents whose home language is Yiddish. The distribution of these materials is supervised by one of the school's 
assistant principals, who ensures that these documents are provided in a timely manner.  

All school documents and signage are translated into Spanish by either school staff or taken from the NYCDOE 
website. All documents that are sent home are always sent in both English and parents' home languages (Spanish and 
Yiddish).  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P.S. 380 will gather feedback on the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services from parent 
surveys, through reports from the PTA and, also, through informal data gathered by the parent coordinator and the 
teachers when they meet with parents. The parent coordinator and an assistant principal will also organize a focus 
group of parents in the school, inclusive of all languages and cultures to gather feedback on the quality of translation 
and interpretation services..
