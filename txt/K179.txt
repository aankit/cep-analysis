Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school’s vision statement, “Building a School-Wide Culture of Learning for PS 179 includes staff, students, and 
families .” Our school’s mission statement is, “Success for all students by meeting the needs of individual learners 
through specific strategies in teaching with an emphasis on vocabulary and the four domains of literacy: reading, 
writing, speaking, and listening.” We will address our school’s vision and mission statement through our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S 179 is a PreK through Grade 5 school located in Kensington, Brooklyn, nestled between Park Slopes and Borough 
Park. We are a Title I school with an enrollment of 849 students. PS 179 is in it's second year as a Community School 
and also offers a Beacon Program. The partnerships with the 21st Century Grant (facilitated by The Leadership 
Program), and the Beacon program have enabled PS 179 to offer year-round resources to families, while also 
providing additional enrichment to students as part of our seamless day. 

PS 179 Services a diverse student population. Our English Language Learners, ELLS, comprise 47% of our student 
enrollment. Our school is 54.45% Asian, with a growing number of students from Uzbekistan and Banghledesh. There 
are also 25% students from a Hispanic background, 4% of Black culture, and 15% of a white origin which indicates 
students coming from diverse backgrounds and not one specific background. Students with IEPs make up 17% of the 
student population.  

The overall rating for the 2016-2017 Quality Review, QR, is Effective and Well Developed. . We provide our students 
with the Common Core Learning Standards in all grades which includes English Language Learners and Students with 
Disabilities. Our school’s strategic partnerships include the Office of English Language Learners, Literacy For Life(Orton 
Gillingham), and American Reading, provides opportunities for our teachers to become empowered with ESL 
strategies.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 179's SWD population comprises 17% of the school. Student classifications include Autism, Speech and Language 
disorders, Learning Disabilities, and Health Related Disorders among others. We offer ICT, SETTS and 12:1:1 program 
settings for students in grades K through 5. We also provide support services in speech, occupational therapy, physical 
therapy, adaptive physical education, counseling and hearing. The academic and social-emotioal needs of our SWD 
have shifted leading to an increase of students in 12:1:1 programs. These students need targeted differentiated 
instruction to meet individual needs. They also need social-emotional support in the form of coping skills and self-
regulation strategies. Parents need support, PD and counseling services in order to support their children.

Out ELL population comprises 47% of the school. Many of our families are experiencing English for the first time. Our 
school’s mission and vision statements support our school community’s uniqueness of having a student population 
coming from diverse backgrounds. Our students and families must have multiple experiences in English through 
reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The language barrier, contributes to many of our students not meeting 
proficiency in the Common Core Learning Standards. However, students are making gains in English proficiency based 
on the 2018 NYSESLAT results. Out of 408 students tested there were 9 Entering, 49 Emerging, 78 Transitioning, 196 
Expanding and 78 Commanding students.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school wide Instructional Focus is that by the end of June 2018 we will increase our daily application of 
implementing “the usage of assessment during instruction” by using Domain 3, component 3C and 3B – Engaging 

 

Framework for Great Schools: 

Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. Our focus will be to strengthen teacher teams through the Districts' s Guidance of Conducting Inquiry 
work in the subgroup of Students With Disabilities as a subgroup. 

 

The element of the Framework, Collaborative Teachers, is an area of strength in which our school has made the most 
progress. Our key area of focus is to continue to strengthen teacher collaboration with a focus on vocabulary. 

Using the Danielson Framevwork, Component 1E and 3C is the 2017-18 Instructional Focus. Component 3B 
Questioning and Discussion will support 3C.. Through professional learning communities within our building, as well 
as external professional development, we are analyzing the elements of effective assessment practices to inform and 
create effective instructional practices based on the Common Core Learning Standards and the most current student 
data. In addition, school leaders maintain an emphasis on 3D-Assessment in Instruction. The staff will focus on using 
assessment in instruction as a means to gather crucial data which will impact and inform planning curricula and 
instruction. Our goal is to create a flexible curriculum that meets the needs of all students. Data will be looked at 
frequently and in depth to ascertain trends and patterns. As a staff, we have identified benchmarks for reading, 
writing, and math to guide our analysis of data so that we may support our students and empower them to become 
college and career ready citizens of the world.  

 

We continue in special initiatives that include Guided Reading in the Kindergarten and 1 st Grade Classrooms.  

In the Framework of Great Schools, Collaborative Teachers is where our school has shown the most growth.  

● Our strengths include a cooperating staff who turnkeys strategies from their attendance at professional 
development to staff.

● We provide teachers with common preps so that they may be ready to support themselves in preparing their 
lessons with grade teachers. 

● We have a vertical and horizontal team to address the needs of all students 

● Teachers consistently monitor and adjust curricula 

● We program inter-visitations and have an instructional team who are instrumental in the turn-around of 
information to grade teams.  

In the Framework of Great Schools, Effective School Leadership has gained momentum because the administration 
leads by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff.  

● Our goals/mission support the staff and students and families 

● We strategically recruit, hire, and sustain personnel. 

● We have established a partnership with the Food Bank of New York. We are recipients of grants from the city 
council and assembly, Target, Healthy Foods, Materials for the Arts, Donor’s Choose, Mighty Milers, the Grow To 
Learn Garden Grant; Recycling Champions from Grow NYC; we received a NYC Eco Schools Litter-less grant; and PS 
179 received a grant from Growing a Wild Brooklyn and Queens Pollinator Grant, and Brooklyn Children’s Theatre.  

●We have a growing parent participation using the Cool Culture partnership in the lower grades. 

●All grades are involving the work of the Parent Teacher’s Association and the Parent Coordinator.

SOP 3.2 - The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of rigorous and 
coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted 
to meet the needs of students. 

School leaders make purposeful decisions with and continued emphasis on academic rigor. This builds coherence and 
promotes college and career readiness for diverse learners. Teachers have developed rigorous lessons that align with 
the CCLS and NYS content area standards. Resources, such as, ReadyGen, American Reading, Go Math and Math 
Exemplars, provide students with opportunities to interact with complex text and academic language. Teachers 
implement strategies to develop math fluency and critical thinking. Vertical and horizontal teams meet to ensure 
implementation of quality instruction. 

Data on the 2016-2017 NYS exam indicates that 32% of students in grades 3, 4 and 5 were proficient in literacy, and 38% 
were proficient in math. Our inquiry work revealed that students did not know how to think critically and logically. They 
could not demnstrate how to plan to address a problem. Our most recent Quality Review indicated that the 
effectiveness of our teaching and learning practes is Developing. Cycles of observation revealed that there was a lack of 
modeling instruction and too much teacher talk. For the 2017-2018 school year we focused our professional

development on strengthening teachers' modeling and developing implementation of the gradual release of 
responsibility. This work began in mathematics on all grade levels. Math exemplars were the vehicle that was used to 
provide high level math problems that required critical thinking. as a result, PS 179's math proficiency increased to 39% 
as measured on the 2018 NYS Math exam. This is a 6% gain from the previous year. 

Our 2018 NYS ELA results showed only a 2% increase in proficiency overall. Data from the 2017-2018 Scool Survey also 
shows a .10 decrease in our rating for Rigrous Instruction from 2017-2018. This data also shows that we are 8% below 
the District average as measure by Common Core Shifts in Literacy. This year through continued professional 
development, planning and inquiry we will focus on the workshop model in literacy through literacy, science and social 
studies while deeper embedding this practice in math. 

Finding time for professional development has been a challenge. Per diem funds were used to provide coverage for 
professional learning and planning sessions. This could not be sustained by the budget during 2017-2018. For 2017-
2018, we created a school schedule that embeds a weekly administrative period for each grade team. This time is used 
for planning and professional learning. To support one of the shift we are making toward Advanced Literacy, teachers 
are using the planning periods to develop a shared curriculum. This includes a coherence of learning objectives, 
language objectives and resources. One noted addition is the focus on vocabulary development and the opportunities to 
address al four modalities (reading, writing, listening, speaking) with each lesson. There is also time within the schedule 
to work with individual and small groups of teachers who need targeted support. Our Assistant Principal and an ENL 
teacher have attended Advanced Literacy training that is being used to support our focus on vocabulary. 

We are also focused on strengthening the instructional core. In the early childhood grades we are focusing on the 
development and mastery of phonemic awareness in all students before the end of second grade. Teachers have 
received professional development on phonemic awareness instruction and they are collaboratively planning lessons 
that align with the State foundational standard (RF.4). We have also incorporated the program Sounds in Motion into 
the classroom. This initiative brings the Speech teachers and classroom teachers together to provide phonemic 
awareness instruction through kenesthetic movements. This benefits all learner, especially ELLs who have no or limited 
exposure to the Engkish alphabetic system. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of teachers designing and implementing CCLS-aligned lessons that provide opportunities to 
engage in the four modalities (reading, writing, listening, speaking) there will be a 4% increase in proficiency, as 
measured by the Spring 2019 NYS ELA exam.

On alternating monthly workshops are offered by departments such as special education to educate parents about 
learning styles and resources. 

The PTA couples there monthly meeting with parent workshops. Topics include financial literacy, immigration and 
health issues. 

Monthly literacy nights have been planned called "Families Read Together". This series of workshops brings students 
and parents together while teaching parents how to work with their children at home. 

Family Literacy Night provides games and hands-on activities that make literacy engaging for all. 

Implemented by: Principal, Assistant Principals, Parent Coordinator, Coaches, Special Education Liaison, ENL teachers, 
RTI/AIS Providers. Translation is provided for each workshop. Parents who can not attend workshops are encouraged 
to reach out to the Parent Coordinator for handouts and related information.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, as a result of teachers designing and implementing CCLS-aligned lessons with differentiated 
scaffolds and supports for subgroup students, such as SWDs and ELLs, there will be a 2% increase in proficiency, as 
measured by Middle of Year (MOY) benchmark assessments. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Midyear Literacy assessment 

After analyzing our middle of year literacy assessment data, our students in grades K-5 have made a 9% proficiency 
growth in their independent reading levels as measured by Fountas and Pinnell for grades K and 1, and American 
Reading for grades 2-5 from September 2018 to February 2019. In September 2018, we had 68% of students reading 
at a level 1, 7% of students reading at a level 2, 13% of students reading at a level 3 and 12% of students reading at a 
level 4. In February 2019, we had 48% of students reading at a level 1, 18% of students reading at a level 2, 13% of 
students reading at a level 3 and 21% of students reading at a level 4. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

developmental health that is aligned to a curriculum or program that provides learning 
experiences and a safe and healthy school environment for families, teachers, and students.  

5.4  All school stakeholders work together to develop a common understanding of the importance 

of their contributions in creating a school community that is safe, conducive to learning, and 
fostering of a sense of ownership for providing social and emotional developmental health 
supports tied to the school’s vision. 

5.5  The school leader and student support staff work together with teachers to establish structures 

to support the use of data to respond to student social and emotional developmental health 
needs.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

5.3 The school articulates and systematically promotes a vision for social and emotional developmental health that is 
aligned to a curriculum or program that provides learning experiences and a safe and healthy school environment for 
families, teachers, and students.  

Our school has several teams in place to support students academic, social and personal needs. We are in our sixth year 
of implementation of PBIS systems. These systems incorporate Those teams include the attendance team, RTI/AIS, PPT, 
SIT and grade teams. All teams are data driven. Teams include guidance counselors, administration, RTI/AIS teachers, 
coaches, teachers and paraprofessionals. Our CBO coordinators from the 21st Century and the Beacon program also sit 
on our attendance team. 

While we have knowledgeable staff in specialized areas of the school, there is a need to increase the remaining staff's 
knowledge of the social and emotional development of our youth. Staff must be able to identify and understand social-
emotional benchmarks in students. Then they need to be able to plan and apply interventions and strategies to support 
all students, especially those in crisis. During 2017-2018 we developed an action plan with the Department of Mental 
Health to provide professional development to the staff.Teachers and paraprofessional participated in workshops to

help them support the emotional and social needs of autistic students, students with behavior issues, and students in 
crisis or going through trauma. Teachers also received workshops in bullying prevention and recognizing signs of 
distress. 

In order to provide more support in the classroom setting, all ENL services are push in. Classroom teachers and ENL 
providers use co-teaching models of parallel teaching, alternative teaching and station teaching to reduce the teacher-
student ratio and provide small group targeted instruction. Support is also given the ENL AIS by having ENL providers 
push into the clasroom of dual licensed ENL-Common Branch teachers to provide small group instruction there. 

The school is in it's sixth year of PBIS implementation. We created a comprehensive PBIS framework that includes 
weekly character building lessons, class discussions and meetings. It also establishes building expectations for staff and 
students. We have scheduled dedicated times for character building lessons through Sanford Harmony as well as times 
for class meetings. Monthly school-wide themes. The staff (including guidance counselors) have developed lessons 
around each theme. 

The NYC School Survey shows an increase in supportive environments from 3.72 in 2017 to 3.84 in 2018. Our goal is to 
keep this momentum going by building upon where we left of in June 2018.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 75% of teachers and paraprofessionals will be able to identify benchmarks in social and emotional 
development for students in pre-kindergarten through grade five resulting in a decrease in overall infractions as 
measured by the OORs Reporting System.

help find resources for families. Parents are also invited to numerous events, including the PBIS assembly, 
performances and open school week. 

In addition to this, we are striving to make communication with the school easier. We have a school Class Dojo 
account that is run by the parent coordinator in which important information as well as artifacts of celebrations are 
posted. We have our school website which informs parents of important events and the learning objectives for each 
month. families are able to use Google translate on the website to receive information in their home language. 
Additionally, any documents that are sent home are translated as well. Teachers communicate with parents through 
Class Dojo and parents are able to keep abreast of student data through IO EducationSkedula and the NYC School

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

4.3 Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)-based instruction 
that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

 

1. The 2017-2018 School survey states: 

95% of teachers say that they design instructional programs (for example, lessons and units) together.  

93% of teachers say that at their school the principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make the school run effectively.  

Our grade teams have three common preps and one adminstrative period scheduled each week where they are able to 
meet together to plan instruction. Our focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to strengthen the instructional core and 
support all leanrers (including ENL students and SWDs) by provided targeted supports to meet their individual needs. 
This aligns with the State standards and shifts in Advanced LIteracy. The shifts in Advanced Literacy are supported by the 
professional development received beginning in 2017 by our Assistant Principal. We also have a literacy coach and a

math coach who work with individual teachers, provide materials to grade teams and meet with teams to support them 
with planning andto provide professionall development. 

 

2. According to the 2016-2017 Quality Review, we need to continue to develop teacher pedagogy. Teaching strategies 
have yet to consistently reflect the use of multiple entry points towards challenging tasks in order to enhance the 
quality of student work products and discussions for all students. The Superintendent also noted the inconsistency in 
instruction, stated that all classroom instruction should be rigorous and provide a productive struggle for all students. 
More professional development and planning time is needed for content area instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal  

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 179, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS. 179 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The Community School strategy has enabled use to extend our school day and offer enrichment activities that we can 
not during the regular school hours. The 21st Century program provides academic enrichment in core areas including 
reading, mathematics, and science to support Common Core Standards. Enrichment activities include nutrition, 
health, art, music, theater, technology and sports. Participants also engage in project-based learning in and through 
the Arts. The most notable impact has been with our Students with Disabilities who participate in high numbers in 
theater, music and dance. Participation in these activities has improved their self-confidence and improved their 
participation in class as well. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, all students enrolled in afterschool programming will receive at least 1 academic enrichment class. 

By June 2019, at least 65% of students will take part in at least 1 community service project per year for up to 2 hours. 

By June 2019, at least 65% of regular attendees will improve their school attendance, classroom behavior, sense of 
self, positive life choices, sense of future and opportunity, and positive peer relationships,

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Achieving our Community School Goals will expose them to challenging material through project based learning. It will 
help them become good citizen by providing service learning activities. It will help students build their confidence and 
self-esteem by performing in sports or the arts. All of this will improve the academic and social-emotional well being 
of each child. As a result they will want to continue in each activity. This will lead to an improvement during extended 
time and during the regular school day.

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Based on the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT,  NYS ELA,  and RTI screeners: Star Early Literacy (K-
2), Star Reading (3-5) results, our ENL students need additional support through direct and 
guided instruction in reading comprehension and fluency, as well as basic literacy skills, such as 
phonics and phonemic awareness. School data indicate a large number of students that fall into 
the Newcomer category (86%). After studying the NYSESLAT results from the spring 2018, we 
observed a pattern where the highest number of ENL students fell into the Expanded level 
category across all grades. Many of these students, especially in grades 3-5,  seem to have stalled 
at this level for too long. Additionally, a large number of new ENL entrants to the NYC DOE 
warrant creating  a program that addresses their unique needs. Furthermore, data from the Spring 
2018 NYS Math assessments and curriculum chapter tests show that students lack fluency when 
performing basic computations and need support with problem solving. By providing 
our ENL students with additional intensive instruction we hope to move them  in grades 1-5 
towards academic success and proficiency as measured by the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math 
state exams.   
 
Therefore, we will create four supplemental programs to support the academic needs of our 
struggling ENL students in grades 1- 5. All programs will be in English language. 
 
One program will be designed for Transitioning and Expanding ENL students in grades 3-5 who 
scored 2 on state assessments. The purpose of this after school program is to increase their 
literacy and critical thinking skills through explicit instruction and intensive practice. Computer 
based programs, MyOn and will provide students with reading materials based on their areas of 
interest and the ability to self correct as they progress in their reading. Reading intervention 
lessons and strategies will be delivered through small group instruction to further develop 
students' reading accuracy and comprehension. This program will run for three 10 week 
cycles and will start In October 2018 and continue through May 2019.. 
The second program will include Entering and Emerging ENL students who are taking the state 
assessments for the first time. In this program students will increase their reading fluency and 
comprehension skills through a variety of reading passages at different readability levels with a 
focus on non fiction selections. This program will take place on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 12 
p.m.. There will be two certified ESL teachers and two Common Branch teachers for this 
program. This program will begin on January 28th and run through April 13th. The emphasis in 
this program will be on reading accuracy, stamina and vocabulary. 
Small group instruction and flexible grouping will be part of the daily approach.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The remaining two programs, called the "Wednesday  Welcome Class", will address the specific 
needs of the new entrants in grade bands 1-2 and 3-5 in language arts.  In these programs 
students will be supported in all four language domains (listening, speaking, reading, writing) 
while developing their vocabulary and comprehension skills. Activities will focus on language 
development (both conversational/social and academic) and vocabulary development Teachers 
will use visuals, realia, TPR, guided reading and other materials that are distinct from those used 
during the regular school day. Additionally, Orton Gillingham's  research-based word study 
system will be used to provide a variety of strategies to improve students' phonemic awareness 
and phonics skills. As part of this program,  students will also build their math fluency through 
math intervention strategies. There will be three 10 week cycles. Sessions will last  from 2:30 
p.m. - 4:00 p.m.  There will be three certified ESL/ Common Branch teachers and/or Bilingual 
Education Teacher. Teachers that will participate in this program will have common planning 
time before the beginning of each cycle to discuss student proficiency levels and how to group 
students accordingly,  what strategies will be the focus for instruction, what materials to use, etc.

Begin description here:            
 
 Since professional development is critical to the success of all teachers and their 
students, including immigrant students, our Title III funds will be used to provide professional 
development to the teachers to support literacy instruction for the Entering, Emerging and newly 
arrived ENL students. A consultant from Orton-Gillingham will work with six Saturday 
Enrichment Program teachers and the Literacy Coach. There will be additional support by the 
Orton Gillingham consultant throughout the year, who will work with respective  grades to 
solidify the implementation of the methodology.The professional development will support the 
utilization of effective systematic, explicit word study instruction. Teachers will be assisted in 
increasing instructional effectiveness through trainings, demonstrations and cycles of 
observation, feedback, modeling and reflection. 
Professional development will be provided throughout the year in MyOn Literacy Program, 
Orton Gillingham Methods, PS 179's literacy and math coaches, DELLS, Division of English 
Learners and the District ELL Support Specialist during the day and after school. 
 
1. Great Leaps- 10 total sessions September 2018 through June 2019; sessions will held during 
the school day for 1 hour each 
2. Orton Gillingham - 10 total sessions September 2018 through June 2019; sessions will be held 
during the school

Part C: Professional Development  
3.MyOn - program - 5 sessions September 2018 through June 2019; sessions will be held during 
the school day at cost 
 
The professional development  will include policies and procedures for registering new admits, 
strategies for working with the newly admitted ENL students, ENL students with special needs, 
Developing level students who are at risk of becoming long term ENLs, as well as the SIFE 
students. Included in these PDs are classroom teachers, ESL/ENL teachers, cluster teachers, 
secretaries, guidance counselors, assistant principals and the principal. 
 
The Brooklyn South Office support will continue, ensuring that all teachers are exposed to the 
array of practices for ELLs, including the students of low level proficiency as well as the new 
arrivals. Attending staff members will, subsequently, disseminate information during  grade 
meetings and school professional development days throughout the year.The main objective is to 
provide high quality professional development that will help the school to critically reflect on its 
current practices and how it is aligned to theNext Generation Learning Standards, students' needs 
and current research.  
 
Also critical to the success of the supplemental program is delivering differentiated instruction 
based on students' individual needs. Teachers will receive training from our Literacy coach in 
guided reading, phonemic awareness and the writing process. The teachers will learn how to 
collect and analyze student data and how to use that data to plan for guided reading instruction 
and student conferences. Topics will include:  data analysis of running records, phonemic 
awareness activities, holding effective student conferences. 
 
ENL/General Education Teacher Teams will continue to receive support in co-teaching 
strategeis. All teachers will receive training and support in advanced literacy methodologies. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact

Begin description here:            
Parental involvement is a critical component of the academic success of students and the school 
as a whole. Therefore, teachers and schools have an obligation to reach out to parents in the 
community in order to open and maintain a dialogue that will foster an effective collaboration 
between the school and the home. Parental activities will be planned according to parent  needs 
and interests obtained through the feedback from the New York City Learning Environment 
Survey, individual parent-teaching meetings and conferences, concerns raised through the school 
leadership meetings, and also the Parent Coordinator's Interests Survey. Since these surveys 
usually indicate that parents are especially interested in ESL classes, computer, and GED test 
preparation classes, these electives will be offered between September 2018 and June 2019. 
 The school is projecting to extend the event into having reading nights in multiple 
languages. The school will also organize thematic workshops such as: Help Your Child to Get

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Reading Assessment system for grades K-1. We use American Reading for 
grades 2-5. Additionally, the MOSL assessments are administered to all students in grades K through 5.  Furthermore, STAR (3-
5) and Early Reading (K-2) are used as screening and monitoring tools for students' literacy skills. This provides insight to 
students' reading levels that are a reflection of their phonological awareness, sight word recognition, word/vocabulary analysis 
and comprehension skills.  The scores are available online through STARS, etc. and analyzed by teachers and administrators.

This data help us to determine how to address the specific needs of our ELLS and to design adequate tiered instruction. 
Flexible student grouping is a reflection of such planning in the form of RTI. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students receive benchmark assessments in literacy and math three times a year. Teachers progress monitor throughout the 
year. Student receive assessments based on units of study. Teachers review and analyze student data. teacher work with grade 
teams and inquiry groups to plan supports for all students including ENL students. Planning for literacy and math is done in six 
week cycles.  The planning incorporates scaffolds and strategies for specific to ENL subgroups. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Throughout the year, our school evaluates the success of our ENL programs by analyzing  the information provided on the 
state tests such as the NYSESLAT,  ELA, Math, as well as the EDAT Tool, and the New York State Accountability Overview 
Report. These assessment  tools help us to determine the strengths and weaknesses of our ENLS and are used for instructional 
planning and choice of strategies. Upon determining  the progress our ENL students are making in listening, speaking, reading, 
writing, and math we identify instructional foci, and build self-contained ENL programs, revise them, or terminate.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

All students including ENL receive the STAR universal screener. That data is reviewed by the RTI team and classroom teachers. 
Tiered interventions are based on that data and the EDAT data. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We are using data from NYSESLAT, ELL Periodic, STAR, Early Reading, Fountas and Pinnel, American Reading Company and 
informal assessment tools to identify ENL students at risk. Currently the RTI/AIS teachers are providing push in AIS services to 
targeted classes based on the demonstrated and changing needs of ENLs. In addition, open access periods have been designed 
to pull out students that require intense intervention and high quality evidence-based instruction.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
On the 2017 NYSESLAT, 16% of the students tested reached the Commanding level. First grade (last year's kindergarten) had 
the highest percentage of students who were Commanding (33%). The lowest number of students (9%) who reached the 
Commanding level are in the 5th grade (last year's 4th grade). Looking at the continuum (45%) of the ELLs in the school are at 
the Expanding level. The data also showed that from the students who took NYSESLAT, 131 were Entering and Emerging.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The testing coordinator and ENL coordinators work collaboratively to provide teachers with the data on their students. 
Teachers are given the names and levels of all of the current ELLs they service in addition the the names of the commanding 
Ells and former Ells in their second year. Teachers are also given EDAT in order identify student's strengths, challenges and risk 
factors. In August, ENL teachers come into school to review the NYSESLAT data and begin making any changes in programming 
needed to meet State mandates. This allows for minimal movement of students when classes begins.

2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our organizational models consist of Self-Contained ENL in kindergarten,  (Co-Teaching) in grades K - 5 and dual 
licensed within both models, the Entering and Emerging Level ELLs receive 180 minutes od stand alone ENL 
instruction and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ ELA or ENL/content area instruction. The Transitioning and Expanding 
level ELLs receive only 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and content area instruction. Former Ells receive 90 
minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and content area  support for two years. All of our ENL teachers collaborate with the 
classroom teachers as well as the content area teachers to ensure consistency and alignment with curriculum and 
instruction. Our program models consist of heterogeneous and homogeneous groups.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

TBE program is not being offered in the school.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

DL program is not being offered at this school. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2a. All of our English Language Learners receive the New York State mandated ENL/ELA instruction time based on 
students’   proficiency levels. Entering and Emerging Level ENLs receive two units (360 minutes) of ESL/ENL - one unit of stand-
alone ENL/ENL and one unit of integrated ENL/ELA or content area instruction a week. Transitioning and Expanding Level ELL’s 
receive one unit (180 minutes) of ENL/ELA or content area integrated instruction a week. Additionally, former ELLs receive half 
a unit (90 minutes) of integrated language support per week. Most classes containing ENL students are of mixed proficiency 
levels. Some classes with students at higher proficiency levels have been formed. ENL teachers are then assigned to classes 
according to the number of mandated minutes needed to service ENL students. Classroom teachers and ENL providers work 
together to plan and implement ENL instruction. 
        
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our school has been using Standards aligned ReadyGen Literacy program for ELA instruction, GoMath for Mathematics and 
also teacher made materials for Science and Social Studies in an integrated ENL/ELA and/or content area model.  ESL/ENL 
teachers utilize multiple entry points to provide content area support during integrated instruction on a daily basis. They 
implement the scaffolded instruction portion of ReadyGen for ELLs, such as pre-teaching vocabulary, additional vocabulary 
practice and text analysis. Students’ vocabulary development is further enhanced through exploring vocabulary in context 
using EXCEL strategies. Additionally, in a stand -alone ENL/ESL model, real life examples and images are incorporated to 
provide a context for language and vocabulary. Computer technology is utilized to provide the opportunity for modeling 
reading and multiple exposure to text to promote fluency. The students can control their learning pace by pausing, and 
replaying, independently. Other  strategies include techniques such as Total Physical Response (TPR), role-playing, chants, 
concept posters, shared writing posters, word walls, books on CD’s and tapes. In addition, cooperative learning strategies are 
implemented through language practice games, group projects, and pairing of students by language proficiency levels. In a 
self-contained class, the ENL teacher integrates ENL strategies across all content areas to help ELLs reach grade-level 
performance standards. In the push-in integrated model the ESL/ENL teacher accelerates the process of new language 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72 

 

acquisition by using graphic organizers, sentence starters/sentence frames, books in students' native languages,  dictionaries 
and glossaries in students' native languages.This aids in making content comprehensible for students. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We ensure that our ELLs are appropriately assessed in their native languages by identifying the home language recorded on 
the HLIS. After the HLIS process is completed, the school determines the student's native language. The initial registration 
process includes an informal oral or written assessment to determine the student's native language proficiency. To date the 
school has not adopted a universal literacy screener in the ELLs home language. In the classroom students may use native 
language and bilingual dictionaries and glossaries when needed to facilitate comprehension in content area subjects. State 
math and science tests are available in some students' native languages. For languages that are not available in printed form, 
the DOE  Translation and Interpretation Service providers or their approved vendors are hired for oral translations . 
Additionally, ENLs are allowed to use bilingual glossaries during these tests. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.    In addition to the services provided through the stand -alone and integrated ENL/ESL models,  SIFE students are strongly 
encouraged to enroll in our after school English Language Learners Support Programs, and the Summer ENL Program in July. 
These students are also provided with Academic Intervention Services in reading and math. During the regular school day, the 
materials that are utilized are standard based and aligned with York City and State Common Core Curriculum. In addition, we 
have a "buddy" system for our SIFE students to facilitate the transition. 
b.     In addition to mandated services through stand-alone and integrated ENL/ELA models,  when newcomers arrive in our 
school they are paired with  "buddy"  students who speak  their native language. Special attention is given to these students in 
order  to welcome them and assist with the adjustment period. The classroom teachers are encouraged to use alternative 
techniques to communicate with the students i.e. drawings, gestures, chanting, acting out, etc. Translators are provided to 
speak with the students and the students' parents. We also plan to design a Saturday newcomers' program. Title III funds are 
utilized to support these students by providing additional support before/after the school day. In addition, the guidance 
counselor is available to support the ENL newcomer population with academic, social and assimilation issues. The school 
appreciates and nurtures culturally diverse backgrounds  in order to develop an atmosphere of understanding and inclusivity. 
Each cultural group’s attributes are explored, examined and discussed. The children are encouraged to find commonalities in 
the various ethnic groups in our school. Dual langauge books and native language dictionaries provide additional support. 
c.     In addition to mandated services through the stand-alone and integrated models,  English Language Learners who are 
being serviced 4-6 years are invited to attend all afterschool programs. They are included in Academic Intervention Services by 
ESL certified teachers . Title III funds are utilized to provide these students with additional academic support. To support 
content area instruction, ENL teachers use the push - in model and provide support to  students in reaching the Common Core 
Standards. Small group and one-to one instruction are part of daily practice to improve their reading and writing skills. 
d.    In addition to the mandated stand -alone and integrated models,  long term English Language Learners are serviced 
through differentiated instruction to meet the individual learning styles of these students in the classroom. These students are 
encouraged to attend our after school programs supported by Title III funds which will include test preparation for New York 
City and State standardized tests. Academic Intervention Services are provided for these students as well. Parent workshops 
are conducted throughout the school year so that parents can support their children at home. We also encourage these 
students to participate in the Title III summer school program that is designed for English Language Learners. 
e.     Former ELLs are given additional time accommodations on all tests for 2 years after reaching the Commanding level. 
Additionally, former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL support a week. These students are encouraged to attend 
afterschool programs designed for ELLs.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 For our English Language Learners with special needs, we use a combination of data to identify and hone in on the students' 
specific needs. We use the student's IEPs, communication with the School Assessment Team, classroom teachers and 
paraprofessionals to identify best strategies to meet the special needs of these students. Daily instruction is strongly supported 
by co-teaching, hands on activities, modeling, repetition, and visual aids. The school  inquiry team utilizes research based 
strategies to accelerate academic and language development.  PPT meetings are used to track and discuss student progress 
and next steps. Teachers use Orton Gillingham, Fountas and Pinnel, and American Reading to foster language and vocabulary 
development. Centers and learning stations are used to facilitate English language growth. Differentiated small group 
instruction takes place throughout every school day. Other strategies include TPR, using visuals, repetition, engaging students 
in hands- on activities, role playing, use of technology, books on cd, etc... Teachers of SWDs use a positive reinforcement 
system to motivate children and encourage academic success. If students' IEPs call for native language support, the school 
assigns alternate placement paraprofessionals to facilitate comprehension. Bilingual picture dictionaries/glossaries are used 
for additional support.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDS, students may be mainstreamed in areas that they are more proficient, based 
on formal and informal assessments and teacher recommendation. Curricular flexibility occurs according to students' needs 
and proficiency. Students are involved in small group instruction throughout the day. After school programs provide focused 
small group instruction and formal test preparation. According to their IEPS, students are eligible for accomodations that 
include timing, setting, and method of presentation in the classroom and during formal testing. According to IEPS, students 
receive flexible scheduling during respective content areas, such as  Math, ELA, etc. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Based on our literacy screening tools (STAR and Early Reading), RTI  intervention in ELA is designed for all students including 
ELLs who score 1 - 2 grades below grade level in grades K-5.  Students that were closest to the benchmark were given a 
priority. The intervention was then expanded and students that scored lower were included. The RTI program that the school 
has adopted is called GREAT LEAPS. It can be used to support students in both reading and math fluency. On a classroom level, 
teacher provides tiered instruction for designated groups.  Students that score 50% or lower on the end of unit GoMath 
receive RTI intervention in small groups by an AIS provider.  The instruction is in English, however, native language materials 
are used for additional support. The targeted intervention is infused with skills in content areas which align the curriculum to 
the Common Core Learning Standards to increase academic language and rigor.  The Dual Language class provides the native 
language support in Spanish.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The American Reading Program has been implemented for our grade 2-5 students, and Orton Gillingham is being used for our 
K-5 classrooms. This year, the school has adopted the  STAR and Early Reading as screening tools for data collection in grades 
K-5. Targeted students in grades K-5 are receiving AIS through a program called Great Leaps. Our data indicates a large number 
of ELL students in the Newcomer 0-3 years. After analyzing the RLAT, we found that we have students who are stalled at one 
proficiency level and are not showing growth over time. In addition, we have identified a weakness in the reading and writing 
modality. Therefore, we are considering new programs that are recognized by the DELL that may help to provide the 
appropriate ELL remediation. We have implemented the Common Core Ready Gen Curriculum for ELA and the Go Math for 
Grades K-5. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are given the opportunity to participate and are afforded equal access to all school-wide programs and extra-curricular 
activities. ELL students are invited to all school-wide programs through letters offered in the preferred language of 
communication that are sent to the families. ELLs are invited to all Afterschool programs. We offer enrichment programs for 
students in grades K through 5. The Beacon program supports students in grades K through 2. The 21st Century grant supports 
students in grades 3 through 5. The enrichment clubs offer programs that appeal to different ELL subgroups and provide 
enrichment in the arts and STEM. The activities provide opportunities for students to read, write, speak and listen in English as 
well as increase their background knowledge and memory skills. The Title III Saturday programs support all ELLs in literacy and 
math content. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
There is a variety of technological support for ELL students, such as ELMOS, Smartboards, overheads, laptops, computers and 
computer software. Students use Imagine Learning that provides native language support as well as BrainPop Jr., Starfall, 
Reading A-Z and MyOn and other academic internet sites. Students are able to access these academic sites from home.  Books 
on CDs and tapes, both in English and Spanish in a dual class, are also utilized to help our students increase their listening and 
speaking skills.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Dual language books are available in all classrooms. Bilingual and picture dictionaries are also commonly used. School staff 
support students in native langauges whenever possible. Translation services in students' native langauges are provided in 
science and math during formal assessments. Glossaries and word- to -word dictionaries are also available and distributed to 
all ELL and Former ELL students as well as their classroom and cluster teachers. In the First Grade Dual Language class 
instruction is delivered in Spanish and English in all content areas.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services provided to ELLS correspond to their age and grade level. All materials are grade, age and content 
appropriate. The content of materials is specifically aligned with student's native language when applicable. Lessons are 
designed based on the Common Core Learning Standards specific for each grade however, differentiation targets students' 
specific needs. Raz-kids and Reading A-Z allows students to access reading materials at both their reading and interest levels.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The school does not provide new arrival activities before the new school year. However, all newly arrived ELLs are supported 
from day one through activities that promote development of social language as well as academic skills. According to our 
motto: everyone is a teacher of ELL, these students are included in academic instruction with scaffolded support by ESL/ENL 
teachers and content area teachers. We have a well developed "buddy system" to facilitate acclamation. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

provides the support in implementing effective practices for stand-alone and integrated instruction. Furthermore,  PDs in 
effective ways of Co-Teaching, allow classroom and ESL teachers to apply and follow common core learning standards in a 
manner that meets the needs of individual students.  The Orton -Gillingham approach provides the tool that helps  ELLs solidify 
phonological awareness and vocabulary development which, in turn, enables students to effectively participate in all academic 
areas.  Additionally, new teachers of ELLs have the opportunity to consult with an experienced ENL teacher through the 
mentoring system.

teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers are provided with ENL professional development throughout the year. PDs are offered from DELLIS, BFSC, 
educational consultants and the UFT. This year our UFTTC coaches will provide professional learning that will address meeting 
the needs of our ENL students. These workshops will help to meet the required hours. 
 
 ELL training is provided to all staff members in accordance to the CR Part 154.2 that requires 50% of total hours for 
ENL/ Bilingual teachers and 15% of total hours for all teachers.  PDs provided by the BFSC, DELL and other offices are turn- 
keyed to the rest of the staff. All agendas and attendance records are maintained in a log by the ENL Coordinator. 
 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to parent orientation meetingand DOE scheduled parent -teacher conferences, ENL teachers meet with parents of 
ELLs individually during parental sessions on Tuesdays.  Parents of ELLs are invited to discuss the purpose of ESL services, the 
student's language development progress, assesment results and language needs in all content areas.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are continuously encouraged to become members of our PTA and to volunteer in the school community. They assist 
teachers during literacy activities, participate in Dr. Seuss' Day celebrations reading to students, and also work with individual 
students. The parent coordinator has an important role to recruit and organize parent volunteer and involvement and starts 
the process with an annual welcome meeting early in October. Parents' presence is felt in the entire school through a variety 
of other activities, such as food bank distribution, picture day and seasonal celebrations: Pumpkin Patch and all inclusive 
holiday celebrations. The PTA and the entire school community assist in holding movie , Bingo and International nights, 
Spelling Bee and monthly celebrations of student achievement. An additional way to foster parental involvement is to provide 
parents with the skills that are necessary to help their children to succeed by organizing thematic workshops. Some of these 
workshops are: Help Your Child to get Ready to Learn (PK - 2), Library Workshop (PK - 5), Healthy Cooking Workshop (PK - K), 
Get Out and Go (PK - K). 
The Parent Coordinator supports parents in understanding the core curriculum in all academic areas. During the conferences 
parents are made aware of their children's progress, are informed of the student and parental expectations and are provided 
guidance in how to achieve learning goals. During all parent teacher conferences, parent workshops and PTA meetings, the 
school provides translation/interpretation services to ensure effective communication. The staff uses head-sets for 
simultaneous interpretation and also "Language Pens" which translate from English into major languages spoken in our school. 
Open school weeks are especially popular among parents of ELLs because they have an oppportunity to observe instruction 
and develop techniques that they can apply at home.

adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During registration, each family fills out a Home Language Identification Survey for each child entering NYCDOE 
school. This form, along with an interview, determines the child's home language. The HLIS also asks the parents 
what their preferred language of communication is, both oral and written. The home language is entered into the 
ATS screen for every new admit. A RCPL report can be run to help assess the language needs of all the parents in 
the school. Parent language information is also filled out on the admission application and each copy of the child's 
blue emergency card.

All preferred languages are updated by the Pupil Accounting Secretary in September. the parent coordinator oversees 
the translation of documents sent out to parents throughout the school year. Administration and event facilitators 
secure translators for events. 

Translated signage for parts is posted on the Flat Screens in the lobby and the office. Posters from OELL and School-
made posters and flyers are displayed at the entrance and around the school. Staff is utilized as translators. Service, 
such as The Big Word are contracted as needed.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In addition to being notified of their rights during registration and orientation, the school refers parents to the NYC 
DOE website for information about translation and interpretation services. The school obtains necessary notification 
documents via the Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet site. Additionally, the Parent handbooks that are 
distributed at the beginning of the school year and at the time of registration are translated into several languages, 
such as, Bengali, Urdu, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The parent survey is a reliable source of feedback on the quality of translation and interpretation services that the 
NYC DOE provides. Also, parent coordinator, teachers, and paraprofessionals provide additional input. The school is in 
the process of setting up a focus group composed of parents inclusive of different cultures and languages 
representative of the school in order to gather optimal feedback.
