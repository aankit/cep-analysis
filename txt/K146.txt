Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 
At the Brooklyn New School, we believe that children are creators of meaning in their own lives. They are naturally 
thoughtful and curious, and they work to gain understanding of the world they inhabit. When the adults who care for 
children foster their inquiry, children become lifelong learners. Parents and educators are partners in this process. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

Every child follows their own developmental path. We recognize the uniqueness of each child and meet children 
where they are. We encourage them to embrace challenges and support them on their journey. By working and 
learning together, children grow to appreciate and value the way others experience the world. 

Collaboration allows our collective strengths to shine. We envision a democratic and diverse world in which people 
come together across differences. We strive to create such a community within 610 Henry. We hope that this 
experience will equip our graduates to bring such a world into being.  

 
 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

THE BROOKLYN NEW SCHOOL (BNS) has a current enrollment of 686 children. BNS was founded in 1987 by parents 
and teachers who wanted to create a school with a racial, ethnic and economic balance, where children engaged in 
active learning, where children of different skill levels work together, and where parents are involved in their child’s 
education. BNS is committed to academic and personal success for all students. We believe that children are creators 
of meaning in their own lives. They are naturally thoughtful and curious, and they work to gain understanding of the 
world they inhabit. When the adults who care for children foster this effort, children become life-long learners. BNS 
students master concepts as active thinkers and doers. Math, science, social studies, art and music are integrated in 
hands-on exploration. Children study the city, the environment, history and culture. They learn to ask questions, use 
tools to measure, make estimates and draw conclusions about what they see and feel. Children learn their ties to 
other people, to the past and to the future. They become stronger readers and writers by using reading and writing as 
tools to carry out their investigations. Our inquiry based curriculum enables students to problem solve and to effect 
change. They apply knowledge gained in school to real life situations. Students develop projects with teachers in and 
outside of the classroom. We are committed to education, which stresses cooperation rather than competition. 
Classes are not tracked and there is no gifted program. BNS families are crucial in their children’s education. To inform 
this partnership, our teachers write descriptive progress reports and every family is scheduled for at least two half-
hour conferences each year with their child’s teacher. Teachers and families also communicate regularly through 
notes and letters sent via the student’s folder, text messaging and email. Families are seen as unique resources for 
the entire school and are welcome in every classroom. Participation is encouraged, whether it involves coming on a 
class trip, a weekly or monthly commitment to help with a particular classroom activity, volunteering for our Parent 
Tutor program, or a contribution focused around an annual event such as June Share. BNS is pleased to have a 
partnership with Brooklyn Arts Exchange, which provides creative dramatics and movement to all classes. Music is 
taught to all students. BNS practices reflect training from Bank Street’s Emotionally Responsive Practice, The 
Morningside Center, Responsive Classroom and NYU's Metrocenter/ESI. Students learn and practice conflict 
resolution in peace education lessons. Student teachers come to train at BNS from many education programs, 
including Bank Street, Brooklyn College, LIU, Oberlin, Syracuse and NYU. BNS partners with high school internship 
programs at Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies, City as School, and the Institute for Collaborative Education 
(ICE). BNS shares its building with the Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies, and together the two schools 
collaborate in many ways, including the sharing of a well-resourced library. Brooklyn New School maintains a well-
equipped computer lab. Each classroom has an extensive library, and classroom computers are distributed 
throughout the school.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have approximately 30 percent special education students who are taught in integrated co- teaching classes. A 
SETSS teacher, speech and language teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapist and guidance professionals 
are available to meet special learning and social needs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Many families who self-identify as having adopted family members and gender nonconforming family members seek 
out our school because of our social emotional approach to learning.  

Our school is also a part of the NYC Diversity in Admissions Pilot. As such, admission priority goes to low income 
families. 

  

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

BNS is a PROSE school, and this year we focused on refining our performance based assessment system as a way of 
listening to children and looking at a work sample. All third to fifth grade students participated in one round of 
performance based assessment. In each grade level, a different work sample was used. Third grade students 
presented their West Africa projects, while fifth graders talked about their Mayan research and shared both a 
project and a paper. These assessments took place in March. In June, fourth graders presented their historical 
fiction related to New Amsterdam. Each child was listened to and interviewed by a panel of adults. Included on the 
panel were the child’s teacher, another teacher, and administrators, paraprofessionals, and parents, as well as 
outside visitors. Panel sizes ranged from three to four. In addition to informing the panel about their topic, the 
students also discussed their learning process. This allowed teachers to support students’ in their metacognitive 
thinking. The ongoing implementation of the PBAs was a major undertaking and a huge accomplishment for the 
school. All staff participated in this work. This work will continue in the 2018-2019 academic year.  

In the 2017-2018 school year, the school codified its math curriculum while also providing professional 
development devoted to deepening staff understanding mathematics. Teachers discussed how to be responsive to 
inquiry from children around math and how to facilitate conversations with children that support the development 
of their number sense. In addition, a vision statement for mathematics instruction was developed with input from 
our entire staff. In 2018- 2019, we will continue this work and expand a piloted intervisitation model into the early 
grades.  

There will be a continued focus on the social emotional and physical health of our children. We are excited to refine 
and document school-wide wellness initiatives around mindfulness with the goal of having a common language in 
this area. We intend to seek out and participate in health and wellness related training as a staff. 

Additionally, we will focus our efforts on documenting our growing and changing inquiry work in the early and 
upper grades, including Forest School (Pre-K) and Shore School (Kindergarten).  

Finally, Brooklyn New School is excited to participate in the Showcase Schools program, and looks forward to 
sharing our inquiry practices with others for a second year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
As as staff, we have engaged and will continue to engage in conversations about race, racism, equity, and inequities in 
our school, school system, and our world. The diversity initiative requires that all teachers are culturally sensitive to 
the different ways in which our children experience school. We must work together to share experiences. We have 
worked with different organizations at different points in our journey so far, and our internal Race and Equity 
Committee is dedicated to continuing this work during the next school year. This committee met for a full day of 
"June Planning" in June 2018, to discuss the importance of various elements of this work, including developing safe 
and brave spaces, community building, direct teaching and conversation with our children about race and racism, and 
affinity group work in a variety of formats. Our children are empowered to speak about their experiences, and 
through created spaces like Conversations of Color and our GSA (Gender and Sexuality Alliance), students can elect to 
discuss their experiences and observations. 

A guiding text that came to us through a few sources (The Chancellor's Conference and through our work with 
ESI/Critically Conscious Educators Rising) is titled Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain, by Zaretta Hammond. 
By reading excerpts of this text as a community (staff reading groups, SLT reading, parent shared reading 
experiences), we can deepen this work across all areas of our day. This will meet our need for shared vocabulary and 
open discussions about difficult topics. In addition, deepening our shared definition of "rigor" as a community will 
serve to decrease miscommunications and expand parent understanding of the work we are doing each day. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

In the 2018-2019 school year, we will have direct conversations and further our approach to teaching around 
topics of race racism. We will frame our work with the lens of Culturally Responsive Teaching. We will discuss 
how progressive education, race and privilege intersect in our school community, and how rigor plays a role in 
this conversation for each of us.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH).

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
By sharing the concept of Culturally Responsive Practice with The School Leadership Team and families, we are able to 
extend the learning to our whole community. While teachers will go deeply into the tenets of culturally responsive 
teaching and the effects on the brain, parents will become cognizant of the theory as they observe its impact on their 
children. We will know we have done the work when families can articulate the underpinnings of this theory in 
practice. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The School Wellness Council has worked tirelessly to support the staff and children around social emotional learning. 
Composed of the health and PE teachers, the administration, the guidance staff and the school social worker, the 
School Wellness Council has supported the development of a school wide curriculum related to wellness. This 
curriculum begins with the use of emotionally responsive practice in early childhood and culminates with a unit 
entitled, “What Are You Willing to Stand Up For?” in grade five. In addition to supporting children with curriculum 
units on anti-bullying and self-regulation, the School Wellness Council broadens this work to connect children to the 
outside world. The big idea of educating the whole child is embraced. Curriculum units around nutrition, HIV/AIDS, 
and physical and mental health are school-wide. Children understand that teachers are responsive to their needs. 
Teachers work together to support struggling students, including for example, working with individuals on peace 
contracts and meeting with them on a bi-weekly basis in order to help them achieve personal goals. School-wide town 
meetings around bus behavior and health issues such as cancer and diabetes support all students in understanding 
the needs of others. Mindfulness strategies are taught and staff share mindfulness techniques and language in order 
to provide a consistent school tone.  
As a school staff, we reflect that we do not feel as confident in the areas of physical health and well-being, i.e. first aid 
and seizure response, as we do in the realm of social emotional health. As we continue to grow and welcome students 
with a range of medical needs, we plan to expand our comfort and responsiveness in this area.  
With the addition of a second PE teacher through the PE Works partnership, our Wellness Council will have increased 
bandwidth to tackle this work.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
In the 2018-2019 school year, we will host health-based professional learning opportunities to increase our exposure 
and comfort with medical issues that exist within our school community. We will work to know our children through a 
health and wellness lens, engaging in professional learning around that topic. We set a goal for all of us to be more 
prepared and better equipped to respond. Additionally, we want to expand our school-wide knowledge of the Autism 
spectrum.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Brooklyn New School is fortunate to have a math coach who works directly with teachers and students to develop 
the curriculum, which includes EngageNY and other math programs. Teachers meet every other week with the math 
coach. Together they look at student work and determine instructional needs. Teachers share a tension they feel 
between our structured, sequenced approach to math, which is in stark contrast to the inquiry-based, individualized 
approach we take to every other subjects. Teachers express concern about students’ math understandings from one 
year to the next and about curriculum expectations not being aligned with individual student needs. At the same 
time, the math coach sees a need to further teachers' understanding of mathematical concepts. This past year, 
Brooklyn New School participated in Internal Coherence Work, in which we looked for areas of inconsistency. After 
having every teacher complete a survey, we zeroed in on math instruction with the goal of improving school-wide 
coherence in this area. Professional development in mathematics was implemented as well as the creation of a school 
wide vision statement for math. Expanding on this work, we see a need to continue to get into teachers' classrooms 
to observe common practice and collaborate on teaching methods and ideas.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Building on the Internal Coherence work of our third and fifth grade intervisitations, we will expand their pilot, focusing 
on the structure of teaching math in grades K, 1, 2, and 4. As we staff, we will continue to think about the use of 
consistent tools and models such as the tape diagram.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At the Brooklyn New School, children come from a range of neighborhood and cultures and enter the school with a 
variety of needs. The Pre-K and Kindergarten classes are made up of new students while every class in grades one to 
five services some new admits every year. Many of the new students need time and support to adjust to a different 
school, different environment and an approach to teaching and learning, which may be unfamiliar. Also, students 
switching schools in grades one to five may have issues around self regulation. Knowing that some children can feel 
very vulnerable and fragile during the school day, the school administration works with the teachers and the crisis 
intervention team to support their efforts to support their students. Most students respond to emotionally responsive 
practices and to the structure of the classroom. A few students need more. More may come in the form of time with 
the principal or a member of the crisis intervention team, or a session with the guidance counselor or school social 
worker. More may also require time out of the classroom to process big feelings and reactions. Truly working through 
a difficult moment often requires a quiet, safe space.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

In the 2018-2019 school year, students in crisis will feel the support of the crisis intervention team, while 
learning calm-down strategies and language to process their big feelings in the space of our new "calm down 
room." In these moments, the response for students in crisis will come from a broader team, so that the 
classroom teacher experiences support alongside the child in need.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The community at the Brooklyn New School is a diverse one. Children are coming from very different neighborhoods, 
given that our school is not zoned to a single district. Their experiences and traditions vary, and we believe that it is 
essential that all of their voices are heard and stories are told. We are continuing to explore ways to bring the less-
engaged families into our school through community events. We continue to organize events and gather reflective 
feedback to build a program for family engagement to meet the needs of our diverse community.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  

With a focus on increasing parent participation in the school community and bringing to light the many rich 
traditions and experiences of the range of families in our school, we plan to offer opportunities for family 
gatherings across all seasons of the school year, with intentionally structured "mix it up" community building 
activities to engage families in conversations with families they do not yet know.

Rethink engagement strategies for "New Families Picnic" to 
encourage families to talk to each other and build connections 
(such as labeled/color-coded name tags and a community 
building game). 

The Race and Equity committee will lead the staff in ongoing 
community building activities, with the intent for teachers to 
utilize these protocols during parent engagement events. 

Our School Wellness Council will lead us in a Family Wellness 
Night in the Winter, with events led by staff members and

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 146, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 146 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community;  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 146, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The Brooklyn New School uses the ECLAS-2 and Fountas and Pinnell systems to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  The 
information obtained from these assessments is used as a valuable tool for collecting and recording data about a child's oral 
reading and comprehension as well as enabling teachers to match students to appropriate books.  Furthermore, our teachers 
design formative assessment that is linked to the curriculum and daily instruction.  Teachers use student work to understand 
what students know and how they think.  Our data has revealed that students who have a strong base in their native language 
are  much more successful academically in English than those who struggle in their native language.  Furthermore, we see that 
most of our ELLs have come to us with functional language in English, but lack conceptual skills in their native language.  This 
presents significant challenges, as the linguistic abilities of our ELLs do not often match the demands of the classroom.  We 
have observed that our ELLs in the early grades do well with concrete language and the use of visuals in the classroom, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

 

that the greatest indicators of successful learning are the concepts that they bring to their new language.  Yet, as the demands 
of the curriculum increase, beginning in fourth grade, our ELLs often struggle with the abstract academic language used in the 
classroom.  Review of our 2016 data has indicated the need to further support our ELL students in literacy, especially around 
non-fiction.  This data has allowed the school community to design specific intervention services to further support our ELLs 
and drive our school's instructional plan.  Assessment results reinforce the need to emphasize academic language for our 
ELLs  in the upper grades as well as reinforce the need for our ELLs to develop a toolbox of strategies for reading 
comprehension. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Our AIS Committee meets bi-weekly to discuss specific intervention services that are needed.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
BNS has an online database and teachers are required to fill in student benchmarks periodically.  At the beginning of the year, 
teachers are asked to review data.  Furthermore, teachers administer reading assessments and fluency screenings several 
times a year.  The ECLAS2 is administered periodically in the lower grades.  Additionally, our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students 
complete performance based assessment in ELA/social studies and their performance is evaluated according to teacher 
designed rubrics.  Students present their work to a panel of teachers, administrators and parents. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our AIS Committee and our classroom teachers gather and analyse data from our summative assessments and make 
instructional decisions based on their findings. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our entire school uses data from our ongoing informal assessments to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to 
Intervention framework.  We all engage in end of unit assessments from the core curriculum, leveled running records, 
orthographic assessments and anecdotal notes.  RTI navigates our entire school improvement process for all learners in order 
to reduce the number of students who experience academic and behavior obstacles.  As a school, our teachers work together 
within the RTI instructional model to engage in ongoing informal assessments and monitoring that identify at-risk-
learners.  We provide appropriate academic intervention support for those students who are struggling with both academic 
and behavioral issues.   We focus on what students can achieve and search ways to personalize instruction and build on our 
students' strength  for all our learners, including ELLs.  Our Academic Intervention Team works closely with our ENL teachers to 
ensure that all ELL students receive intervention at each tier of the RTI system: in the classroom, in small groups led by 
intervention specialists, and from their ENL teachers.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Outcome assessments data from the NYSESLAT is used to evaluate and inform our ENL program.  Our ENL teacher uses the 
RLAT from ATS to monitor the listening, speaking, reading and writing progress of our ELLs and design curriculum accordingly. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teachers share these findings with our AIS committee in order to make adjustments to our program.  Our school 
administrators monitor all adjustments to our program.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ELL instruction in our freestanding English as a New Language program at BNS is organized through both integrated 
and standalone ENL in grades K through 5 as per CR Part 154.2.  Whenever possible, ELL students are homogeneously 
placed in one class on a grade so that our ENL teacher can provide integrated ENL instruction along with the general 
education teacher to support academic language learning for our ELLs.  If there are ELLs needing an Integrated 
Collaborative Team Teaching class, we also try to program the ELLs together so that our ENL teachers can support 
these students in an Integrated ENL model as well as provide the mandated hours of standalone ENL.  Because our ELL 
population is so small, we are able to arrange schedules so that ELLs are serviced within their classroom as well as in 
the ENL room.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our close attention to ELL scheduling and our limited number of ELLs allows us to meet the linguistic needs of all our ELLs and 
ensure that all our ELLs receive the mandated units of study as per CR Part 154-2.  Our entering and emerging ELLs receive 180 
minutes of standalone ENL per week and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  Our transitioning ELLs receive 90 
minutes of standalone ENL per week and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA per week.  Our expanding ELLs receive 180 
minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week and our commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
instruction per week for two years after they achieve commanding status.  Because of our limited ELL population, the number 
of instructional minutes our ELLs are receiving is easily monitored by our pupil accounting secretary and our 
administration.  Furthermore, ELL students are picked up from their classroom and brought into the classrooms with their 
peers to receive integrated ENL services.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content area instruction at BNS is delivered in English.  Math, science, social studies, art and music are integrated with hands-
on exploration.  Children see the city, the environment, history and culture.  They make conclusions about what they see and 
feel.  Children learn their ties to other people, the past and to the future.  They become stronger readers and writers by using 
reading and writing as tools to carry out investigations.  Our inquiry based curriculum enables students to problem solve and 
to effect change.  Children apply knowledge gained with teachers in and outside of the classroom.  Instruction is experiential 
and hands-on with a standards-based curriculum that also focuses on children’s individual needs and interests.  Instruction in 
our early grades makes use of concrete materials and manipulatives that make meaning easy.  BNS has implemented an ENL 
program that ensures continuity of instruction and language development as well as academic rigor.  Our ELLs participate in a 
rigorous instructional program that is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  Our method of instruction is a 
combination of TPR, CALLA and The Natural Approach.  Our New York State certified ENL teachers work with our staff to 
support scaffolding classroom learning and differentiated instruction for our ELLs.  Our Balanced Literacy approach follows the 
workshop model of Teachers College and our teachers provide scaffolds to enable our ELLs to process new information.  This 
rigorous standards-based instruction that meets the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards utilizes a variety of 
materials that integrate listening, speaking, reading and writing and foster critical thinking skills.  These materials are aligned 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

to our school curriculum and reflect the native language of our English language learners.  Included in these materials are 
colorful photo libraries, bilingual picture dictionaries with accompanying workbooks, Words Their Way Word Study Notebooks, 
Jazz Chants for Children, Scott Foresman Newcomer books, Hampton-Brown Avenues Level A-D, Benchmark English Explorers 
social studies and science books, as well as our comprehensive classroom libraries and music CDs.  To support use of the native 
language, our classrooms libraries contain many culturally relevant bilingual picture and chapter books, bilingual non-fiction 
science and social studies books and bilingual picture dictionaries.  The native language is used in the classroom to support 
high challenging content area instruction.  Furthermore, all our ELLs are provided with a variety of instructional strategies to 
assist them in the development of academic language and literacy in content areas.  The six major types of scaffolding – 
modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, text-representation and meta-cognition – are evident in all our 
classrooms.  We believe that when ELLs are given appropriate rigorous instruction, school experiences, academic intervention 
and high expectations, they can achieve at the same levels as their peers.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All entering Spanish speaking ELLs are administered the LAB in Spanish when they first enter our school.  Our NYS certified 
Spanish teacher, Taura Ottey, administers this formal assessment.  Because we are a school with a diverse population of 
Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, French, Italian, Arabic and Japanese staff speaking staff, we are able to devise our own informal 
assessments to appropriately evaluate ELLs in their native languages. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Because BNS is a diverse learning community, our instruction needs to be differentiated.  Furthermore, our ELL students have 
different languages, backgrounds, interests, styles of learning, reading levels and different degrees of skills and strategy 
mastery that necessitate a flexible approach to teaching by varying content, process and products.  Brooklyn New School has a 
plan for SIFE students even though we presently have no SIFE students.  This includes making an individualized student needs 
assessment, creating an AIS plan for the student that focuses on the literacy and math component, utilizing grade appropriate 
instructional support materials, differentiating instruction in all areas and providing our staff with professional development in 
both identifying and scaffolding instruction for these students.  BNS also has a plan for ELLs in school for less than three 
years.  These Newcomers are welcomed into our school and made to feel comfortable and secure.  Our buddy system pairs 
newly arrived ELLs with students who speak the same language and also serve as good English models.  Teachers create 
opportunities for our Newcomers to listen to English and interact with other students in small groups as well as opportunities 
for newly arrived ELLs to participate in classroom projects that support language development.  Targeted academic 
intervention, such as Wilson Reading and Great Leaps, is also offered to our Newcomers.  Newcomers are encouraged to 
attend our After Care School Program and make social connections.  Additionally, to prepare for ELA testing after one year, our 
Newcomers are given individualized student needs assessments, with an AIS plan that focuses on literacy and math and 
provides differentiated instruction using grade appropriate instructional support.  All test accommodations for ELLs and 
Former ELLs including extended time, use of word to word dictionaries and separate location, if necessary,  are 
provided.  Similarly, our instructional plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years involves intensive daily academic intervention 
in Wilson Reading, Guided Reading, Great Leaps and small group math pullout support.  Although we presently have no Long-
Term ELLs, our action plan for Long-Term ELLs, whose scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments suggest that their 
challenges are in reading and writing, involves daily targeted intervention in reading and writing, monitoring the progress of 
students in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs and encouraging participation in after school literacy 
programs.  Former ELLs also receive literacy intervention from our Academic  Intervention Team and are provided with testing 
accommodations for two years after achieving proficiency.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

Our teachers of ELL-SWDs use a variety of instructional strategies and grade-level materials that provide access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English language learning.  Our method of instruction is a combination of TPR, CALLA and The 
Natural Approach.  Our ESL teachers work with our staff to support scaffolding classroom learning and differentiated 
instruction for our ELL-SWDs.  Our IEP coordinator oversees that mandated services are delivered as per CR Part 154-2. Our 
Balanced Literacy approach follows the workshop model of Teachers College and our teachers provide scaffolds to enable our 
ELLs to process new information.  This standards-based instruction utilizes a variety of materials that integrate listening, 
speaking, reading and writing and foster critical thinking skills.  These materials are aligned to our school curriculum and reflect 
the native language of our English language learners.  Included in these materials are colorful photo libraries, bilingual picture 
dictionaries with accompanying workbooks, Words Their Way Word Study Notebooks, Jazz Chants for Children, Scott 
Foresman Newcomer books, Hampton-Brown Avenues Level A-D, Benchmark English Explorers social studies and science 
books, as well as our comprehensive classroom libraries and music CDs.  To support use of the native language, our classrooms 
libraries contain many bilingual picture and chapter books, bilingual non-fiction science and social studies books and bilingual 
picture dictionaries.  The native language is used in the classroom to support high challenging content area 
instruction.  Moreover, all our ELL-SWDs are provided with a variety of instructional strategies to assist them in the 
development of academic language and literacy.  The six major types of scaffolding – modeling, bridging, contextualization, 
schema building, text-representation and meta-cognition – are evident in all our classrooms. Each classroom from grade 2 
through grade 5 includes a SMARTBoard, as well as shared personal computers and word processors (AlphaSMART keyboards 
and Chromebook computers), which allow our ELL students to explore academic language through the use of technology.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELLs-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment.  We began with one third grade ICT class several years ago, and slowly expanded the program so that 
there is now there is at least one ICT class on each grade.  Students who need more continuous support than they receive in 
SETSS but who do not require the intensive support of a smaller 12:1 classroom, now have an appropriate supportive 
classroom placement in our school.  With fourteen ICT classes and numerous general education students receiving SETSS, 
speech/language support or occupational therapy support, we now have a larger number of ELL-SWDs.  This year, more than 
half of our ELLs have their own Individual Educational Plans, reflecting their individual needs and goals.  Our plan for these 
students has been a collaboration between the ENL teacher, the classroom teachers and the IEP teacher to ensure that all our 
ELL-SWDs are serviced as per their IEP and are receiving proper accommodations and modifications. Children are learning 
amongst their non-disabled peers as often as possible, to meet their individual needs.  Because the ICT model is proven to be 
successful in meeting needs of ELL-SWDs, this placement recommendation is carefully considered by the IEP team which 
includes our ENL teachers before placement is determined.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
BNS has comprehensive Academic Intervention for all students in need, including entering, emerging, transitional, expanding 
and commanding English language learners.  Targeted intervention in literacy, math and science takes place throughout the 
school year and our ELLs are afforded equal access to these services, offered in the English language.  All our supplemental 
programs for ELLs are embedded within the scheduled day, which begins at 8:10 AM and ends at 2:30 PM.  Our extensive AIS 
program offers Reading Room, Reading Recovery, Great Leaps, Wilson Reading, Fundations and 1:1 tutoring to ELLs in 
kindergarten to grade five with a reading intervention specialist.  Our ELLs are invited to participate in this program through 
the use of translated letters and permission slips to parents.  Additionally, teachers offer reading comprehension, phonemic 
awareness, Wilson Reading and content area reading during the school day.  In the area of mathematics, BNS offers At-Risk-
Math and Great Leaps Math to our ELLs.  Furthermore, teachers, volunteers, our Math Staff Developer and our Math Coach 
offer support in English to small groups of students, including ELLs.  Social studies content is pre-taught and re-taught in ELL 
sessions using picture-rich texts and visuals to support content-area learning for our ELL students.  Science instruction, led by 
our Science Coach, are often times for our integrated ENL programming to provide targeted intervention supports within the 
classroom context. Native language is always used when possible.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, we will expand our Academic Intervention Program by increasing our AIS staff and extending 
the program to serve many more students, including ELLs.  Additionally, conversational English classes for ELL parents are 
being considered for the upcoming school year.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There are no programs or services for ELLs that will be discontinued.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Translated letters are sent home to invite them.  Furthermore, ELL-
SWDs are integrated into the regular ENL classroom and have equal access to ENL with the regular education ELL 
population.  Our extensive academic intervention program in reading and math is available to all ELLs.  Additionally, our after-
care program is also available to BNS students, including ELLs.  A range of workshops and activities is offered in this program, 
and over the years has included basketball, jewelry making, cooking, dance, hip-hop, chess, soccer, photography, music, 
reading and math.  Moreover, Jugamos a Cantar, a popular after-school class acts as support to our Spanish classes, taken by 
all BNS students.  At Jugamos a Cantar, students learn through Spanish song, rhymes and games. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
There are a variety of instructional materials, including technology, used to support ELLs that have already been 
mentioned.  The materials used in our Freestanding ENL program are aligned to the Common Core Curriculum.  This includes 
the use of high interest texts and primary sources.  Materials also include native language sources and instructional technology 
to support both English and the native languages of our ELLs.  Word work and grammar review are incorporated into the 
curriculum.  To support learning, ENL libraries include leveled books in social studies and science and hands on materials and 
leveled books for math.  Moreover, BNS maintains a state of the art computer lab with a Smartboard and updated 
computers.  Computers are installed in nearly all of our classrooms and all of our grade 2-5 classrooms house 
Smartboards.  Our science program also uses a multisensory approach to learning which is extremely beneficial to our ELLs as 
well as other types of learners.  Our math program encourages the use of a variety of manipulatives in order to solve 
problems.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Because educators at BNS recognize that a child's native language is a valuable asset to be fostered, we also offer native 
language support to our ELLs through our Spanish classes and through daily interactions with our large staff of bilingual 
teachers and paraprofessionals.  Additionally, the Spanish language and Latino culture are important parts of the school-wide 
curriculum and we take pride in our yearly 4th grade musical which includes original Spanish songs and poetry. BNS is 
fortunate to have many staff members who are bilingual and who assist in assessing the native language of our ELLs. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  In the early grades, for example, ELLs and ELL-
SWDs participate in our Fundations Reading Program.  In the later grades, ELLs receive Wilson Reading and Great 
Leaps.  Analogously, in the early childhood years, ELLs are exposed to age appropriate literature and multicultural read-
aloud.  In later years, teachers introduce age appropriate chapter books and nonfiction. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our K-5 school shares a building with Brooklyn Collaborative School, a 6th to 12th grade school, and we are fortunate to have a 
very close bond with our sister school upstairs.  There is  a great deal of collaboration between our two schools.  Older 
students upstairs partner with our young students downstairs and act as mentors that foster community.  Furthermore, our 
young students benefit from being read to by the older students and establishing social bonds in our mutual space.  Moreover, 
younger ELLs are introduced to older ELLs and regularly visit each other.  Both schools host a joint fund raiser at the end of the 
year in addition to celebrations throughout the year.  Our two schools share a gym, a library and a cafeteria, and our staggered 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

school schedules ensure that our shared spaces are used harmoniously.  Both Brooklyn New School and Brooklyn Collaborative 
School administrators meet regularly to ensure that all of our ELLs' academic, linguistic and socioemotional needs are met. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Brooklyn New School offers ELLs and their families many opportunities to ease the transition into our school.  During the 
month of May, incoming students and their families attend orientation, meet our staff and visit our classrooms.  In addition, 
our New Families Picnic, held every June in Prospect Park, enables new students, including ELLs, another opportunity to meet 
our staff and get to know other children who will soon be attending school.  During the summer, classroom teachers welcome 
all of their new students with an introductory letter.  This letter is translated into the home language of our new 
students.  Additionally, on the first day of school, BNS holds two parent orientations, one early in the morning and another 
later in the afternoon.  To meet the needs of parents of ELLs, we provide oral interpretation and translation services at all our 
activities, with the assistance of our dual language staff members and volunteers from our active parent body and 
community.  Throughout the year, new ELLs meet weekly with their reading partners from upper level classrooms and 
maintain relationships that foster community.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

ELLs at our school are offered Spanish elective classes. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development, provided by school staff, is a high priority at Brooklyn New School.  Our ENL Teachers have recently 
attended Differentiating Instruction Language Development workshops at Bank Street College Graduate School of Education as 
well as Professional Learning Community Meetings at Teachers College.  In the recent past, our ENL teachers have also 
attended Quality Teaching English Learners (QTEL) workshops, the Wilson Reading Program training and TC Calendar Days.  As 
part of our continuing commitment to maintain and expand professional development, we place staff development concerning 
the needs of English language learners at the top of our agenda.  At our weekly Monday afternoon staff meetings, we continue 
to offer ongoing study groups with a focus on both language goals and content goals for our ELLs in meeting the Common Core 
Curriculum Standards. During weekly planning times set aside for grade-level teams (two periods coupled with lunch once per 
week), student work is carefully examined, sorted, and assessed by teachers.  ELL student work is carefully analyzed.  Every 
Monday, our full staff comes together to discuss our CEP goals and our inquiry work for the year, as well as our progress.  Our 
ELL students continue to come up in these discussions as we make instructional decisions for all of our learners in all content 
areas.  To assist our ENL teachers in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards, our ENL 
teachers  attend monthly PD at the Brooklyn North Field Support Center that revolves around the Common Core Learning 
Standards and ELLs.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our bilingual Guidance Counselor, Dalisa Gomez-Brown, provides staff with information about local middle schools that 
specifically service ELLs as they transition from elementary school to middle school.  Dalisa attends workshops and has 
personally visited many middle schools in our district and nearby districts to provide personal experience and description in 
the home language of families to assist ELLs and their families as they transition from elementary to middle school. Our ENL 
Coordinator and ENL Teacher, in collaboration with our staff members who speak Spanish, Cantonese,  Mandarin, Italian and 
French, provide professional development that meets the 15% of total- hour -requirement for all teachers as per CP Part 154-
2.  This PD addresses second language acquisition, including scaffolding learning for ELLs, integrating content and language 
goals and differentiating instruction for our English language learners.  Teachers College workshops are one example of the 
ways that our ENL teachers meet the 50% of total hours requirement. Our Principal keeps records for professional 
development activities, including agendas and attendance.  Our administrators, subject area teachers, guidance counselors, 
related service providers, secretaries, paraprofessionals, parent coordinator and School Based Support Team attend this 
PD.  As a community we examine our curriculum maps and units of study and design templates for integrating specific 
language structures, functions, scaffolds and vocabulary for our ELLs, as our staff understands that every content lesson for 
ELLs is, indeed, also a language lesson.  Furthermore, our ENL teachers attend monthly ELL Liaison Meetings which 
include   ELL-specific professional development.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Each year, in addition to initial parent orientations, parent-teacher conferences and grade level breakfasts, our ENL teachers 
meet individually with the parents or guardians of all English language learners.  At this annual meeting, many topics are 
discussed including goals of the ENL program, language development process, language proficiency assessment results and 
language development needs in all content areas.  Interpretation and translation is provided as needed. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

BNS families are crucial in their child’s education.  To inform this partnership, our teachers write descriptive progress reports 
and every family is scheduled for at least two twenty to thirty minute conferences each year with their child’s 
teacher.  Teachers and families also communicate regularly through notes and letters sent via the student’s folder and 
email.  Families are seen as unique resources for the entire school and are welcome in every classroom.  Participation is 
encouraged, whether it be coming on a class trip, a weekly or monthly commitment to help with a particular classroom activity 
or a contribution focused around an annual event such as the Curriculum Share.  Our welcoming school environment 
celebrates diversity and encourages parents of English language learners, as well, to become part of our school community by 
participating in informal morning breakfasts, writing celebrations, Parents-As-Partners classroom events, parent workshops 
and school trips.  Displays of student work in the main entry of our building and outside all classrooms greet our ELL family 
members as they drop off and pick up their children.  In addition, parents of ELLs are invited into our classrooms to share their 
culture, language and life experiences.  Parents of English language learners are a valuable resource within the classroom and 
often assist BNS teachers with cooking, art projects and musical performances.  As required by Part 154, we offer Parent 
Orientation Workshops led by our Parent Coordinator to parents of new ELLs in September and when necessary, throughout 
the school year.  We also offer two other workshops, which address such topics as Homework and Study Skills and 
Understanding Your Child’s Curriculum, to parents of ELLs during the school year.  Translation is available as needed during 
these events.  Topics of these workshops range from ELA/ENL Standards and Assessments to Promotional Policy.  Our Parent 
Coordinator acts as a liaison between the school community and parents as they are integrated into our community, and as we 
learn what they can bring to it.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anna Allanbrook, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In an effort to develop the necessary lines of communication with families who have limited or no English 
language oral and/or written skills, BNS has various structured mechanisms. When first entering the NYC DOE 
school system, our students’ families are given the Home Language Survey (HLIS) in their native language. The 
survey identifies the language of the student and the home language spoken by the family. Furthermore, our 
Language Access Coordinators send the DOE Parents’ Preferred Language Form to all families. The data from 
these forms is inputted into ATS, added to our Student Emergency Cards as well as our ELL Information Binder. 
Our Language Access Coordinators ensure that all information to our parent community is translated into the 
preferred language in a timely manner.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school will make limited-English Proficient parents aware of their right to receive information. BNS families 
receive a copy of Parent Guide to Language Access in their preferred language. Furthermore, there is a Language ID 
Guide at our security desk. In our main office, which all visitors must go through, we have signage which describes the 
languages spoken by school staff and in which languages parents can have translated materials. Lunch forms and 
health forms are provided in the parent's preferred language. Moreover, special education conferences are conducted 
in the preferred language of the parents by bilingual school staff. Our Language Access Coordinators ensure that all 
brochures, fliers and letters are translated into parents preferred languages. Furthermore, simultaneous translation is 
provided at all our PTA and School Leadership Meetings as well as our parent engagement events. 

   
 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our parent surveys help us gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. Our Language 
Access Coordinators work together to ensure that all parental voices are heard, including limited-English proficient 
parents. Based on parental feedback, our school has recently reached out to NYCDOE@thebigword.com to inquire 
about translating IEPs. Furthermore, our school has purchased translation tools and paid bilingual staff per session to 
expedite our translation needs.
