Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

We aim to equip students, academically and socially, with the tools they need to succeed in high school, college and 
their careers. Our school will develop leaders who are prepared to influence the forces that shape their communities, 
the nation, and the world. To accomplish this goal, our strengths are that we have invested in Common Core aligned 
curricula in the core subjects to prepare our students for the challenging demands of the new standards. We provide 
after school academic support for our students in need of intervention and also provide academic intervention during 
the school day in small group AIS. We offer Regents courses in Common Core Algebra and Living Environment and 
provide test preparation for the Specialized High School Examinations for our 7th Grade students. We have adopted 
the Core Ready curriculum in ELA and the Key Elements of Mathematics curriculum in math. Teachers receive 
coaching support in both curricula to effectively implement both common core aligned programs. We are also utilizing 
iReady to assess student mastery of the common core standards and are providing AIS for all students in need of 
further supports after school and during the school day. We have partnered with Community Based Organizations 
Xposure, Team First and East Side House to expose children and adolescents in to the worlds of Science, Technology, 
Finance, Work Ethic, Nutrition, Community Service and stronger Parent/Child Partnerships. We have also partnered 
with Beacon after school to provide homework help, sports and activities designed to promote academic and social 
well-being.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

About 28% of our population are students with special needs. Our needs range primarily from emergent reading 
levels, and numeracy below grade level expectations. In order to better serve this population we need to look at our 
explicit instruction, differentiation, and targeted AIS programs. Data shows that we are inconsistent with this 
population and need to do a better and more measurable job with this cohort of students.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress is Effective School Leadership. 
According to the 2016 Quality Review, "School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff. 
Expectations connected to career and college readiness are shared with families." The school budget, coupled with 
staff input, resulted in the strategic use of resources that were well aligned to the School Comprehensive Education 
Plan (SCEP) and school-wide instructional goals. Teachers attended external PD opportunities, turn-keyed strategies, 
and collaborated with external coaches who provided pedagogical support to individual teachers and teacher teams. 
Additionally, ELA and math consultants worked with targeted teachers to support their planning and instruction, with 
an emphasis on integrating literacy into the content areas, as well as an emphasis on NTN/ KEMS implementation in 
math. A strategic decision that demonstrated growth in Tenet 2.3 was retaining a dean to support the social, 
emotional and behavioral needs of our students by implementing a PBIS initiative, which led to a decrease 
suspensions and overall student behavior incidents as measured by OORS data. 

The key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 School Year are: 

• Expanding on the process of the refinement of CCLS aligned curricula across all grades and content areas in order to 
build coherence and emphasize rigorous skills to prepare all students for the next level.  

• Strengthen the alignment between teacher practice and the school’s beliefs about learning, to ensure high levels of 
engagement and thinking, so that all learners reach their full potential.  

• Ensure engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to 
Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

 

Our 2018-2019 Instructional Focus: 

IF Mott Hall Community School addresses student needs through goal setting, one on one conferencing and small

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Mott Hall Community School (MHCS) will work to support and facilitate the quality implementation of rigorous and 
coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and also ensure that unit and lesson 
plans that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS coherent curriculum are instrumental in stimulating higher-order 
thinking and building deep conceptual understanding and knowledge for all students.  

Our Strengths: 

According to the Framework for Great Schools, a successful classroom requires a strong curriculum aligned to the 
Common Core — that challenges students, scaffolds their experience, and is enlivened by teachers who are engaged 
with their craft. We are continuing to utilize CCLS aligned curricula Core Ready and KEMS and we are utilizing the 
Inspire curricular resource for science and the Passport Curriculum for social studies. We have provided time in our 
schedule for Grade Level and Content Area Meetings where teachers share best practices, analyze curricula to make 
adjustments to raise student achievement and analyze student work. We will be partnering with external curriculum 
experts to foster teacher collaboration within and across grades and subjects to enable students to have access to a 
robust curriculum that incorporates the arts, technology and other enrichment opportunities. 

Priority Needs: According to the 2016 Quality Review, "Across classrooms, teachers use or create assessments, and/or 
rubrics, that are loosely aligned with the school’s curricula. Across classrooms, teachers’ assessment practices 
inconsistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding. As a result, students receive limited feedback and 
there are inconsistent adjustments made to instruction in order to meet student-learning needs." Mott Hall needs to 
ensure that teachers are providing concrete, actionable and timely feedback to students during instruction. Also, 
across classrooms, teaching strategies inconsistently provide multiple entry points into the curricula and student work 
products and discussions reflect uneven levels of student thinking. As a result of inconsistent implementation of 
multiple entry points, there is uneven engagement in appropriately challenging tasks and uneven demonstration of 
higher-order thinking skills in student discussions and work products.  

 

Action Plan: Mott Hall Community School will align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading 
practices, and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and 
classroom levels. MHCS will support teacher teams to make necessary adjustments to all curricula ensuring high levels 
of cognitive challenges for all students. We will partner with curriculum experts and coaches to create scaffolds and 
multiple entry points for all students, including students with disabilities and ENL students. Professional development

will also be provided to all teachers on rigorous habits and higher-order skills across grades and subjects so that all 
learners, including ENLs and SWDs, can demonstrate higher-order thinking.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
During the 2018-2019 School-Year, Professional Learning Communities will work together to produce unit plans that are 
CCLS-aligned and engage students in higher order thinking and discussion that will result in high quality student work 
that aligns with or exceeds the expectations defined by grade-level standards. Quarterly revisions to unit plans are 
preceded by the monthly examination of student performance via "thin slicing" student artifacts, allowing for curricular 
and pedagogical adjustments to promote engagement and performance.  
These processes will lead to increased rigor in the classroom, with standards based instruction consistently and 
uniformly applied in all instructional areas, affording students points of access regardless of academic performance 
level.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In reflecting on Tenet 5, Mott Hall Community School has created structures to ensure that each student is known 
well by at least one adult who helps to coordinate attendance, social-emotional learning, child/youth development, 
and guidance/advisement supports that align with student learning needs. 

Our Strengths:  

For the 2018-2019 School year, we have partnered with high quality organizations, Xposure, East Side House, Team 
First, CHAMPS and Beacon to provide after-school enrichment and homework help to all participating students. We 
have incorporated electives into the schedule to allow students to choose between music and art, as well as coding. 
We have a PBIS point system to recognize positive behavior and a School Implementation Team (SIT) that meets 
weekly to plan interventions for at risk students. MHCS has an active Student Government that participates in the 
decision making process with School Leaders. We also have two full time guidance counselors who facilitates peer 
mediation and at-risk counseling for those students in need. 

Our Needs:  

The school leader and the support staff are developing a plan for teachers to begin to understand how to use data to 
address student social and emotional developmental health needs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, staff and students will participate in comprehensive programs to promote student enrichment, 
academic support, personal behaviors for success and individualized student goals resulting in a 10% reduction of 
Principals and Superintendent suspensions as evidenced through OORS reports.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to our 2016 Quality Review, "The majority of teachers are engaged in structured professional collaborations 
teams; however, they are ineffectively connected to school goals and assessment data for students they share. 
Professional collaborations allow for observations about student work and data. However, these actions do not yet 
result in improved teacher practice or progress toward goals for groups of students.  

Our Strengths:  

We have provided time in our schedule for Grade Level and Content Area Meetings, we provide professional 
development on best practices to improve instruction and provide opportunities for teachers to attend external 
professional development opportunities. We utilize data to inform instruction and we utilize expert coaching support 
to develop our teachers.  

Areas of Need:  

MHCS will work to support teachers to stimulate deep levels of thinking and questioning in students through the use 
of adaptive CCLS (or content based standards) instructional materials that contain high levels of text and content 
complexity and multiple strategies to provide a wide variety of ways to engage in learning. 

Priority Need  

Provide professional development and inter-visitation opportunities to support teacher pedagogy to support the CCLS 
Shifts across all content and grade levels. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will meet in teacher teams to incorporate strategies to improve student learning which will 
result in a 5% increase in students meeting proficiency levels on F&P leveled assessments.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

A. Weekly department Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs) where teachers and school leaders analyze data and 
refine curriculum centered on feedback received in observation 
cycles. Department meetings are used primarily for curriculum 
updates, pedagogical discussions, and data analysis. Discipline-
specific teams collaboratively look at student work across grade 
levels in order to gain a longitudinal perspective on the 
strengths and weaknesses of the school’s curriculum and 
pedagogy, and teachers are able to share successful practices 
and activities with their departmental colleagues. (SOP 4.2)  

B. Understanding by Design template and principles will be the 
framework for unit planning in all core subject areas, and each 
unit will be aligned to Common Core Learning Standards in 
literacy and mathematics. Webb’s Depth of Knowledge will be 
the framework for designing questioning and discussion 
techniques, as well as infusing and tracking higher-order 
thinking skills in the curriculum. Universal Design for Learning 
will be the framework for differentiating instruction and 
providing access to all learners, including the development of 
multiple entry points for ENLs and students with disabilities. 
(SOP 4.3)  

C. Professional development in unit and lesson planning will be 
facilitated with all teachers, including: lesson plan clinics with 
network achievement coach, PD cycles in the implementation of 
the Core Curriculum in ELA and math facilitated by publishers 
and central DOE curriculum staff, PD cycles in refining 
curriculum maps, unit and lesson plans to align with the 
Common Core Instructional Shifts facilitated by literacy and 
math consultants, and additional PD facilitated by school 
leaders. (SOP 4.2)  

D. School leaders will gather, assemble, and disseminate school-
wide data for administrative and pedagogical review to inform 
instruction. (SOP 4.5)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to our 2016 Quality Review, school leaders provide training and have a system of accountability for meeting 
identified expectations. School leaders and staff offer ongoing feedback to families to help them understand their 
children’s progress towards expectations. 

Our Strengths:  

School Administration looked at observation data from the previous year to determine trends in teacher practice, 
instructional challenge areas, and opportunities for staff leadership and growth. 

Our Areas of Need:  

Focus on open-ended questions that invite discussions among students is not yet the norm. For example, during the 
last Quality Review, classroom teachers asked questions directed to individual students, yet follow-up questions 
about how they arrived at an answer were not always prompted. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will provide coherent CCLS aligned instruction through the infusion of UDL, checks for 
understanding and high order thinking strategies through the support of effective school leadership via weekly 
departmental meetings and feedback through the observation cycle, resulting in a 3% increase in students reaching 
proficiency on the NYS Math and ELA Exams.

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

A. Formal and informal observation cycles aligned to the 
Advance teacher evaluation system provide feedback and next 
steps to teachers to facilitate differentiation in the classroom. 
Observations will occur monthly from September until April. 
Feedback from prior observations will be cycled into the next 
observation to ensure that all feedback is actionable. (SOP 2.5)  

B. Professional development surrounding the domains of the 
Danielson framework will be provided to all staff, facilitated by 
school leaders, instructional leads in literacy and math, 
administrative interns, network achievement coaches, and 
outside consultants. (SOP 2.5)  

C. Weekly department meetings where teachers and school 
leaders analyze data and refine curriculum centered on feedback 
received in observation cycles. Department meetings are used 
primarily for curriculum updates, pedagogical discussions, and 
data analysis. (SOP 2.3; 2.4)  

D. Students requiring additional targeted instruction beyond the 
regular school day will be referred to extended day tutoring on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays for 90 - minute blocks of small-group 
targeted instruction. Data sources are consulted and utilized to 
refine student groupings based on analysis of the most current 
data. Usage of F&P levelling and technology equipment will help 
support student academic and social needs.

According to the 2016 Quality Review, parents stated that they "receive monthly packets that outline what their 
children will be working on. This packet provides families with information on upcoming units and expectations in 
student work. Additionally parents stated that through Pupil Path, an online grading book, they are able to track and 
monitor their children’s achievement, including projects and missing homework. Parents shared that in addition to 
Pupil Path, they receive emails, text and phone messages, from the school." 

Our Strengths:  

The entire school community utilizes Datacation and Global Connect: texting, email and voice messages, monthly 
information packages, monthly workshops, bi-weekly parent newsletter and weekly parent outreach. 

We have instituted open office hours on Tuesdays for parents to meet with the Principal, no appointment necessary, 
to promote dialogue and support student success. 

We have also instituted a monthly Breakfast with the Principal to strengthen communication between parents and 
the Principal.

A. The Title I Committee consists of parent volunteers that, in 
consultation with, and approval of, the School Leadership Team, 
are responsible for allocating Title I funds from the school budget 
earmarked for parent involvement and engagement. The 
committee will survey the community, gauging interest on a 
variety of workshop topics. Based on the results of the survey, 
the committee will work with the school to secure highly 
qualified consultants to facilitate workshops that closely match 
the topics indicated in the survey as highly desirable by the 
community. (SOP 6.4)  

B. MHCS administration, staff, and parents will collaborate on 
the development of a parent handbook. This handbook will be 
distributed to every parent. Additionally, a monthly calendar of 
Mott Hall events will be distributed to all families as well as 
maintained on the school website and in the main hall, in both 
English and Spanish. Mott Hall Community School will increase 
the number of events parents are invited to, including awards 
ceremonies, talent shows, curriculum nights, and workshops. 
Additionally, MHCS will improve communication efforts; in 
addition to backpacking flyers home, the school will make phone 
calls home, mail letters, follow up with Blackboard Connect calls 
and emails. (SOP 6.3)  

C. The parent coordinator will develop and lead parent 
workshops on topics parents find most useful, including 
Engradepro online grade book, NYC School Accounts and the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Also, parent workshops in 
preparation for state assessments, navigating the school 
website, the high school selection process, and assisting students 
with organizational and study skills will be offered. The school 
will make a coordinated effort to reach out to parents inviting 
them to chaperon monthly field trips, and encouraging their 
involvement in dances and other events. (SOP 6.2; 6.4)

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Mott Hall Community School Parent Involvement Policy  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Mott Hall Community School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. The school will maintain this information.  

 

 

Mott Hall Community School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The Community school strategy is to support academic instruction through our three objectives which 

are improving student attendance, exposing students to high school articulation process and STEAM 

programming. Community School partnered agencies offer various programming focus on STEAM for 

our students such as Robofun, Sprout By Design, and Coding through Lego Robotics. Through these 

programs students will be able to enhance their skills which will help them expand their career 

objectives through student exposure and support of these three goals. It will also reinforce in class 

learning, and afterschool participation. 

 

An additional element of this work will be to enhance our after school programming with the help of 

East Side House, Team First, and Xposure in an effort to encourage scholars to remain in the school building longer 

and to target the “whole child” by offering programs that fall outside of the CCLS-aligned curriculum. 

Our SONYC program is STEAM focused. 

 

Our community school staff will track daily attendance, hold weekly student success summit meetings 

to discuss data and scholar progress allowing us to put focus on the Framework for great school (Strong 

Family- Community Ties). As part of the interventions already implemented, a mental health 

coordinator will focus on community building and social emotional welfare of the community schools 

while building welcoming, encouraging and developing partnerships with families, businesses and 

community based organizations. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

ELT- Through our STEAM based programs students will be able to obtain exposure of the various science career fields. 
Students will begin to be exposed to the next generation of technology innovations. These 

hands on program will provide the necessary skills and information needed for students to expand their interest in the 
STEAM world. Attendance Supports- Advisors/ Success Mentors will be assigned to students in Tier 2 who have a 
difficult time arriving to school/ on time. Advisors/ Success Mentors will work with students to develop a plan which 
will help the student increase their attendance. By having an advisor/ success mentor students will have daily 
accountability to check in with the advisor. Family Engagement- We will continue to partner with the parent 
coordinator and the mental health coordinator to plan and implement workshops and events based on the needs of 
the school and families. Families participating in events/workshops provides them the opportunity to see what the 
students are learning in school. It also encourages families to have dinner conversations about their child’s school day. 
Health and Wellness- Through our on site Mental Health Clinic students will receive on site services and prevention 
offered by on site clinician. Vision Screening Services provided by Warby & Parker was a good success. Also a Mental 
health coordinator will be hired to provide added support to families and will be able to provide families with 
resources for things they may be in need of. Parent Resource Specialist- By offering these services, we will help 
students remove any academic barriers that would impede their enrichment. students should only have to worry 
about being a student and not life responsibilities. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
MHCS will increase family participation by making the school a hub of family and community activity and building 
family-school partnerships around student learning and we will fully integrate the broader community and culture 
into the school through activities such as community tours, the Asset Mapping and Needs Assessment process, and 
service provider fairs to share information on available resources. Our CBO also supports us in ensuring that parents 
are enlisted as partners in their child’s education and in developing and implementing the Community School vision 
and ELT is provided for enrichment and tutoring services.

families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.

Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At Mott Hall Community School, the Language  Proficiency Team (Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Ms. Melissa Rosano )/ESL 
Teacher; Ms R Maschio (Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/Spanish Teacher; Mr M Islam (Arabic)/Para 
Professional; Ms F Rahaman (Arabic)/ Related Servic Provider; Ms Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W Robinson/Attendance 
Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent Coordinator; Ms J Negron (Assitant Principal); Mr B Coleman (Spanish)/Parent President,  uses 
various assessment tools to assess the ELLs in our community.  Reading fluency and comprehension are evaluated through 100 
Book Challenge and Codex Materials.  Teacher created assessments are also used to check for understanding and cognitive 
abilities.  Oral questions as well as writing samples guide instruction and indicate how broad an academic backgroundoffers 
each ELL offers.  
This approach provides insights to where the strengths and weaknesses lie and serves as a starting point for instruction for the 
classroom, in addition to assessments done by  Mr O Ling, the ESL teacher.  Instruction is then guided and driven based on ELLs 
baseline performance and benchmarks are noted.  This information is used for differrentiation or indivudualizing instruction 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

and is incorporated in the school's instructional plan as an objective to increase their listening, speaking and writing 
capabilities.            
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have included grade and departmental meetings weekly to review assessment data and set interventions accordingly. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Mott Hall uses various tools to measure the success of the ELLS.  Dated portfolios and anecdotal records are kept on all ELL 
student folders.  Code  X and the 100 Book Challenge where running records are used for those Early Production  and more 
advanced ELLs.  Audio books/ listening centers are also used as benchmarks.   In addition, the meeting Adequate Yearly 
Progress (AYP) is  attained by advancing one proficiency level on the NYESLAT between two consecuitive years; or making a 
total gain of 43 points on the NYESLAT; or scoring at the intermediate level or above on the NYESLAT is a great evaluative tool. 
  
    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Tier II interventions are offered in extended day, and Tier three interventions are individualized and offered during the school 
day. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Mott Hall use data, from Response to Intervention .  This takes on the form of brief, that efficient and repeated testing of age-
appropriate skills or behaiors on all students as well as ELLs works to improve attaining new language skills.  These results are 
used to identify 'at-risk'  ELL students who are in danger of academic failure. These scores are monitored for learning 
difficulties and are assessed to determine the need for suplemental instruction.  A multi-tier model (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) is 
used to mark progress as an ELL is monitored closely.  ELLs can start in a Tier 1 depending on their language proficiency/ score; 
in classroom/small group. Further interventions can be provided in a small group in Tier 2: pull out in nsmall group.  Tier3 
intervention are for those ELLs  who demonstrate insufficient progress in Tier 2: one on one instruction.  The school 
implements the multi-tier model through a Inquiry Group which meets weekly. ELLs are discussed and progress is noted as 
each member of the Inquiry Group is assigned a task/strategy to be implemented. 
Different assessments and data are also used guide ELL  instruction.  This takes on many forms (i.e. abbriviated spellings; 
shorten test format; oral quiz; projects summarizing concepts; home language answers accepted; ipads used to translate 
responses). Results from a multi-disciplinary approach renders a more complete assessment of where the ELL student is and 
what the ELL has mastered.  This can provide a good discussing point with the Inquiry group and a starting point for further 
instruction. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The Language  Proficiency Team (Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Ms. Melissa Rosano (Chinese)/ESL Teacher; Ms R Maschio 
(Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/Spanish Teacher;; Ms F Rahaman (Arabic)/ Related Servic Provider; Ms 
Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W Robinson/Attendance Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent Coordinator; Ms J Negron 
(Spanish)/Assitant Principal ;reviews inconsistencies which are apparent in the performances of some ELL students.  Other 
students demonstrate a consistency in scores.  All would benefit from more oral practice and one on one interactions with 
schlors which are proficient in English.  Data Patterns across performance levels on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and grades reflect 
some inconsistencies with some students. In other students, strong gains and insights to where the ELLs are in Second 
Language Acquisition.    
The NYSITELL confirms the child’s eligibility and is only administered once upon registration if there’s an indication of a 
language other than English on the Home Language Survey. The child’s score will determine if he or she is entitled to receive 
services and will determine the level of English Language support.  Levels in the NYSITELL include: Entering, Emerging, 
Transitioning,, Expanding and Commanding.  This test includes multiple choice, short answer response, long written response 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

and oral response questions in listening, speaking, reading and writing.  The NYESLAT assess annually English language 
proficiency.  It is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and New Language Arts Progressions.  There are various 
Performance Levels. Its focus is through an integrated approach to various modalities.  The complexity that it presents is 
through a grade-level text with a content focus for all levels.  It also its relevant because it is instructionally s academic 
language. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Consistent student and parent forums review and disseminate information pertinent to accrued data.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

For ELL students,  the FreeStanding ENL program provides some instruction in the home language,  
emphasizing English Language acquisition.   The two types are:  
(1) Stand-alone ENL: This is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in  
core content courses.  This is delivered by a certified ENL teacher, Mr O Ling.   
(2) Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction.  It is  
delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or coteaching by a certified ENL teacher and  
a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies).  Both methods  
of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language development using  
ENL strategies.  All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum  
number of units of integrated ENL.   
A combination of the push-in and pull out models is practiced in the Free Standing ENL. 
This enhances student understanding of English while learning classroom content.  At the same time, this  
provides an opportunity for as well  English-proficient peers to serve as language models.”  Push-in models  
promote collaboration between the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher, decrease in-class instruction  
time loss, and decrease student travel time.      

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 Not applicable.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           At Mott Hall, the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided in accordance to the ELLs proficiency level as 
reflected by the score on the NYESLAT.   The five proficiency levels have a mandated total minimum mintues per week in 
accordance with their profiiency level and grade: If the ELL student in in grade 6, 7, or 8, and  s a Beginner/Entering then 360 
minutes per week; if Low Intermediate/Emerging;, then 360 per week;  if Intermediate/Transitioning;, then 180 min utes per 
week;  if Advanced/Expanding then 180 minutes per week; if Proficienct/ Commanding, then 90 minutes per week.  The

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   There are three instructional modells: the Transitional Bilingual model; the Dual Langauge Model; and the ESL model. 
 In a Transitional Bilingual education program,   ELLs have an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing in English.  They also receive a minimum of 2 content-area courses/subjects in the home language and 
English at the entering and emerging levels.  Empahsis is placed on  home language arts component designed to develop skills 
in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students’ home language while cultivating an appreciation of their history 
and culture. It is interesting to note that all of the students in a TBE program share the same home language.  Materials in their 
home language to foster a reading and content skills in their native language as well as materials in English are used. 
  
In a Dual Language Model, all content-area courses and subjects are taught in the home language and English.   A home 
language arts component is designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the students’ home 
language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture.  In this model, 50% of the students are ELLs of the same 
home language; 50% of the students are not ELLs (former ELLs or never ELLs).  Materials in their home language are emphasize 
to create a mastery of their native language and also emphasize the acquisition of English. 
  
In the ESL Modell, ELLs  receive part of their ENL through an integrated model, in which students receive core content area 
(i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies) and English language development instruction.Core content is 
delivered to ELL students through a push-in model.  Materials in core subjects and in English reflecting different levels of 
language proficiency.  Their home language is used to assist and bridge any possible gaps of understanding.  
  
Mr O Ling, the ESL Teacher ciculates and monitors student's comprehension and progress.  Re-Stating Content area, stressing 
one or two main points, peer instruction and modeling responses aids in making information more comprehensible.  Grouping 
ELLs with peers who speak the same language reinforces content area.  This consists in making the ELLs feel more successful 
and motivated in making progress. 
  
Of utmost importance, Mr O Ling/ESL Teacher stives for providing comprehensible input (ie understanding the message that is 
conveyed); make the lessons visual (ie visual representations of new vocabulary words); link new information to prior 
knowledge (ie link instruction to personal, cultural, and world experiences); determine key concepts (ie present unit of study in 
student -friendly terms); modify vocbulary (ie direct instruction of new words with pictures); use cooperative groups (ie work 
in small groups who speak the same home language if possible); and modify testing and homework (ie drawings; oral).  Some 
methods used by Mr O Ling/ ESL Teacher are: (A) the Total Physical Response (ie physical representations); Community 
Language Learning (ie personal links are fostered to enhance learning); and the Natural Approach (risk-free/ no correction of 
errors; emphasis is placed on the use of authentic materials).   Sheltered English is  used to make academic instruction in 
English understandable to ELL students.  Students in these classes are "sheltered" in that they do not compete academically 
with native English speakers since the class includes only LEP students.   In the regular classroom, English fluency is assumed. 
In contrast, in the sheltered English classroom, teachers use physical activities, visual aids, and the environment to teach 
important new words for concept development in mathematics, science, history, home economics, and other subjects. 
  
Ms. Rosano,, ESL teacher provides content area comprehensible by using the home language.  He does this by circulating and 
monitorsing student's comprehension and progress. By Re-stating content area, stressing one or two main points,  peer-
instruction through the home language and modeling responses  he provides support  and reinforces topics and new ideas.   
These methods are in allignment because the texts which are provided is a complex grade-level text which has been modified 
and made more comprehensible to the ELL learner.

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      The Language Profiecency Team(Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Mr O Ling (Chinese)/ESL Teacher; Ms R Maschio 
(Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/Spanish Teacher; Mr M Islam (Arabic)/Para Professional; Ms F Rahaman 
(Arabic)/ Related Servic Provider; Ms Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W Robinson/Attendance Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent 
Coordinator; Ms I Williams/Coach; Ms J Negron (Spanish)/Coach monitor and do on-going testing in the home languages.   In 
addition, content area testing is translated orally and in written fashion.  Responses are then evaluated in both oral or written 
fashion.  In addition, there are on line screeners which can be used to assess content area in the home language. 
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

At Mott Hall, differentiated instruction takes many forms by modifying the curriculum in a classroom. 
Getting to know as much as possible about each ELL is fundamental and adds to the building of a rapport  
and trust.  This will help setting and enforcing reasonable and attainable expectations.  
  
A) A SIFE/ELL student would benefit from solely being pulled out and one-on-one; one important point at a  
time can be emphasized; have the ELL repeat and or explain the teaching point to check for understanding.    
Responses from a SIFE/ELL can be assessed in a check-off list in the home language or in English.   
  
B) A Newcomer/ELL student would benefit from instruction from a peer who speaks the home language.  
The ELL can be responsible  the peer-assigned and learn new vocabulary.  Re-assurances that the ELL is not  
alone creates for a nuturing atmosphere.  Support is given in the home language as well as with English. 
  
C) Devloping/ELL  would benefit from colaborative group where he can hear other's ideas and build the  
ELL's own;  write sentences with vocabulary words/nouns from the lesson.  The use of flexible grouping  
allows teachers to match students with different peers for different types of activities. Support when  
needed is given in the home language, as well as in English. 
  
D) Long Term/ELL would benefit from working with peers in cooperative groups and leadership roles.  Here,  
the ELL leads the discussion; write sentences with vocabulary words.  Support is given in the home  
language, as well as in English. 
  
E) Former ELLs/ who receive at least one half of one unit of study of ENL (90 minutes per week) for two  
years after exiting would benefit from leadership roles and 'peer mentoring'  which would support the  
student’s language development and academic progress.  Support is given in the home language as 
needed, as well as in English. 
  
All Ells are afforded  testing accomodations.  Some of them are:  
1) Time extension (all exams) for ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments and on Regents examinations, such 
as  
"time and a half"    
2) Separate location (all exams):  for ELL students are provided optimal testing environments and facilities . 
3) Third reading of listening selection (English Language Arts exams only): Proctors may read the listening passage three times 
for   
ELLs students on grades 3-8 English Language Arts assessments and on the Regents Comprehensive Examination in English. 
4) Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries: ELLs may use bilingual glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

except languages other than English exams (LOTE) for direct one-to-one translation of words; not for definitions. 
5)Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. If 
SED  
provides translation of state examinations , then ELLS may use both English and home language edition.  This is information 
that  
is so indicated on the answer sheet. 
6) Oral translations for  ELLs for low incidence languages are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations.  ELL student  
may be provided with an oral translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by SED. All  
translations must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. Written translations are not allowed. No clarifications or  
explanations may be provided. Translators should receive copies of the English edition of the tests one hour prior to  
administration. 
7)Writing responses for the ELLs in the home language is not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. ELL student  
making use of alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to the 
open- 
ended question in their home languages. Scoring the tests is the responsibility of the school. 
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In Mott Hall we use many instructional strategies and grade level materials (in home language, in English)  
for ELLs -SWD. They are of high-interest and relevant.  All Materials are alligned to CCLS and the Linguistic  
Demands derived from the New Language Arts Progressions.  All curriculum is modified and adapted to  
meet the different proficiency levels.  Exemplars and posters with main ideas are presented as summarie of  
the objectives. These serve as motivation and incentives to accerlate English Language Proficiency. 
  
Some instructional strategies and approaches for teaching ELLs-SWD  (are presented in home language and  
in ENL): 
-Provide comprehesive input so as to make the home language or ENL information relevant to them; ie information that they 
can relate to or makes sense. 
-Make as many lessons as visual as possible in home language or ENL; ie have as many props and visuals as possible.  
-Link information in home language or ENL to prior knowledge so that they can make connections to something that is known: 
use scaffolding for SIFE/ELLs.  Information needs to be made similar to something they have experienced. 
-Modify intructional vocabulary in home language or ENL to a few words-so that they are not overwhelmed with 20 words; ie 
present 5 words, instead of the 10 words. 
-Use of collaborative learning groups to create a safe/risk-free environment to speak and be heard in  
home language or ENL; ie speaking in small groups is more confidence building and provides a risk-free  
environments to make mistakes. 
-Adjust testing and homework assignment so that it becomes a do-able task in home language or ENL; 
 ie making the test oral; limiting the homework to less. 
-Create interactive lessons with hands on learning so as to make experience more memorable and  
meaningful in home language or in ENL; ie using roleplaying/ re-enactment to portray a scene in a book.  
-Encourage creativity and flexibility in the responses that are expected so as to establish a risk-free  
environment in home language or in ENL; i.e. present different responses in a risk-free environment. 
-Enhance and support the curriculum in home language or ESL by creating activities for all ELLs and students to become 
successful; ie create activites  in which an Emerging ELL can do by pointing or saying a few words. 
-Play cognitive games, i.e. vocabulary bingo, to facilitate vocabulary and language comprehension;  
-Incorporate pocket charts with sentences strips to be manipulated by the ELLs to create new sentences or  
confirm vocabulary meanings; ie noun strips and be placed with correct verb bearing sentence. 
-Include Tecnology and software to facilitate independence and practice in newly presented information. 
This in particular supports all ELL sub-groups as a good many students are savy regarding technology and  
computers. Although the ELLs may not have access at home to technology, in the classroom it becomes a  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

strong instructional strategy/approach which motivates students of all ages and proficiency levels.  (For  
those SIFE ELLs, you can peer s/he with an ELL who is non-SIFE). Here on-line reading programs in the  
home language can be strengthen; or reading materials in the home language heard.  Vocabulary can be  
introduced in English followed with representations of it. On line programs, like ACHIEVE3000, which  
differentiates inreading levels is visual and very appealing. Achieve3000 is available in English and Spanish. 
  
The Language Proficiency Team ((Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Ms. Rosano /ESL Teacher; Ms R  
Maschio (Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/Spanish Teacher; Mr M Islam (Arabic)/Para  
Professional; Ms F Rahaman (Arabic)/ Related Servic Provider; Ms Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W  
Robinson/Attendance Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent Coordinator; Ms J Negron  
(Spanish)/Coach ensures that all mandated related services for the ELL-SWD are rendered.  
ELLs-SWD  whose IEP mandates ESL instruction and Bilingual Instruction are also followed  by the Language  
Proficiency Team.  Mr J Jeanty, Assistant Principal reviews all IEPs with the Ms R Maschio, IEP Teacher to  
confirm that all are being served.  The ESL eligibility is also shown in ATS, where both General Education  
and Special Education are listed. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  The school offers  SETSS (Sepecial Education Support Services) model, Integrated Co-teaching model, and  
Flex Scheduling, and to ELL-SWD who are ready for Least Restrictive Environment(LRE).  If the ELL-SWD is  
meeting or has met their IEP goals then they are ready to meet goals in the next Least Restrictive  
Environment. The School (ie through an Annual Review) or SBST/SAT (School Based Support Team/School  
Assessment Team: through a Triannual) can make the recommendation  for an ELL-SWD to be placed in a  
Least Resctrictive instructional setting.   The school achieves this by offering a SETSS setting (i.e General E 
 ducation placement with the assistance of a push-in SETSS Teacher),  an ICT setting (i.e placing the ELL- 
SWD in a Integrated Co-Teaching setting where there 15 General Education students with only 10 IEP  
students);  scheduling Flex Schedule (ie ELL-SWD is placed in one or two General Education classes). These  
placements foster and encourage ELL-SWD to achieve not only their IEP goals but their English profiency  
goals in a Least Restrictive Environment.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
At Mott Hall, the following are many Intervention programs for ELLs, some are offered in home language (Spanish), some in 
ENL.   All programs are open to the ELL subgroups: SIFE, Newcomer, Developing, Long Term and Former ELLs.  ELL students 
who are failing, in danger of failing, recommended by teachers, or parents are welcome to the Intervention. 
  
-Academic Intervention Services (AIS), is an intervention program which is offered after school in ELA and Math in ENL for 
ELLs.  Attendance Sheets and folders are kept on progress; gains are recorded. 
IEP goals for ELLs are printed and monitored for mastery in ELA and Math.  Their work toward the goal completion is kept in 
folders. Summary Progress chartsare often posted are kept to ensure progress. 
  
-Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) in ELA and Math are offered in English, Spanish/Arabic and ENL. 
Attendance Sheets and folders are kept on progress; gains are recorded. IEP Goals for ELLS are printed and monitored for 
mastery.  Their work toward goal completion is kept in folders.  Summary Progress charts are kept in the classrooms to ensure 
progress. 
  
-Early Period Interventions are offered for ELLs for Social Studies and Science.

Williams/Coach; Ms J Negron (Spanish)/Coach assists in conducting some of the programs offered above. They are also 
instrumental in monitoring outcomes in these programs. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

At Mott Hall, early morning programs for ELLs  will be considered to benefit the ELLs.   Ell students are dropped off early, 
before breakfast. and would benefit from doing something meaningful. This consideration has come from some students, as 
well as parents.  Students have voiced a need for somewhere to go and get help for homework that was not understood.  At 
parent-teacher conference, ELL parents have also inquired as to the existence of an early morning program. 
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

All Programs/services at the school are expected to continue through the school year.     
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At Mott Hall, equal access to all ELLs to school programs are afforded through the availibility of mulit-lingual staff (ie Language 
Proficiency Team (LPT) (Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Ms. Melissa Rosano ESL Teacher; Ms R Maschio (Spanish)/Bil IEP 
Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/Spanish Teacher; Mr M Islam (Arabic)/Para Professional; Ms F Rahaman (Arabic)/ Related 
Servic Provider; Ms Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W Robinson/Attendance Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent Coordinator; Ms I 
Williams/Coach; Ms J Negron (Spanish)/Coach) which conduct each program with all students in mind. ELLs are represented in 
all areas of school life.  They are able to participate in clubs and Intervention Programs to the fullest through a nuturing ESL 
trained staff who is sensitive to their needs. The LPT  reach out to ELLs to explain and answer questions regarding the activity. 
They invite the ELLs to visit and try the club.  This  Some School programs include: (1) Exposure (Enrichment Digital) for ELLs 
and well as non-ELLS, provided by bilingual staff .  The (2) Chess Club for ELLs explains the strategies needed to play chess, is 
offered  by Ms T Plummer/ Guidance Counselor, who has been trained in different ESL methodologies. 
ELLs report to have enjoyed themselves in the club.  Their attendance and their mastery of the art (ie chess digital fotography) 
indicate how welcomed they felt.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The school, uses various instructional materials to support ELLs.  Some examples of this are: 
-technology: use of ipads and pcs; websites 
-cognitive games, ie bingo using content vocab words; hang man; 
-pocket charts with sentence strips      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In Mott Hall, home language support is delivered by the Language Proficiency Team((Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Ms. 
Melissa Rosano/ESL Teacher; Ms R Maschio (Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/Spanish Teacher; Mr M Islam 
(Arabic)/Para Professional; Ms F Rahaman (Arabic)/ Related Servic Provider; Ms Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W 
Robinson/Attendance Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent Coordinator; Ms I Williams/Coach; Ms J Negron 
(Spanish)/Coach;  depending on the need of the ELL student and the program model.  Bilingual books and iPads  are used to 
support the acceleration of the English as a New Language.  Support staff is available from the Language Proficiency Team to 
assist in all three models to accelerate English asquisition. 
  
In the Dual Language program model,  instruction is maintained in both languages (home and ENL).  In this model, half of the 
instruction is done in English and half in the home language.  ELL students are taught alongside English-speaking students so 
that all students become bi-cultural and fluent in both languages. 
  
In the Transitional Bilingual Education program model, instruction  includes Native Language Ats and subject matter in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

home language, as well as intensive instruction in English as a New Language.  Here, as the student develops English 
proficiency using the strengthened knowledge and academic skill in the home language, instruction in English increases and 
home language instruction decreases. 
  
In the Freestanding English as a Second Language, program model, all subject matter instruction is provided in English through 
the use of specific instructional strategies.  Support in the home language may be provided. 
           
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The School ensures all required services/ resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels through strict vigilance from the 
by the Language Proficiency Team 
(Mr J Jeanty/Assistant Principal; Ms. Melissa Rosano/ESL Teacher; Ms R Maschio (Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia 
(Spanish)/Spanish Teacher; Mr M Islam (Arabic)/Para Professional; Ms F Rahaman (Arabic)/ Related Servic Provider; Ms 
Plummer/Guidance Counselor; Mr W Robinson/Attendance Teacher; Ms D Leidy/Parent Coordinator; Ms I Williams/Coach; Ms 
J Negron (Spanish)/Coach.   Records from ATS are crossed –referenced with birth certificates to confirm current grade and age 
placement. 
  
 ESL eligibility, proficiency levels; parental ESL selection; etc.  are  reviewed through documents and ATS reports.   
  
Required services as mandated by the IEP are  reviewed with the  on line program SESIS and Ms McGill, Special Education 
Administrator.   
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The school, uses various instructional materials to support ELLs.  Some examples of this are: 
-technology: use of ipads and pcs; websites 
-cognitive games, ie bingo using content vocab words; hang man; 
-pocket charts with sentence strips      
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Some of the activities that Mott Hall offers before the beginning of the school year for newly enrolled ELLs  is an orientation for 
the new incoming ELLs which happens in early September.  Here, all the new incoming ELLs are invited to take a tour of the 
school. They are introduced to the Main Office, classrooms, bathrooms, library and cafeteria.  The Principal, Mr B Basile 
welcomes all. The Language Profiency Team is introduced: (Mr J Jeanty, Assistant Principal; Ms. Melissa Rosano/ ESL Teacher; 
Ms R Maschio (Spanish)/Bil IEP Teacher; Ms G Mendia (Spanish)/ Spanish Teacher; Mr M Isalm (Arabic)/ Para Professional; Ms 
F Rahman (Arabic)/Related Service Provider; Ms T Plummer/ Guidance Counselor; Mr W Robinson/ Attendance Teacher). 
Library and other organizations are explained in the home language.  Flyers are distributed to ensure that information reaches 
home. High School choices for the Eight graders are discussed.  Light refreshments are served 
  
For the ELLs which are enrolled through out the school year, a similar orientation is done on the day they register.   The ELL is 
taken on a tour of the school: Main Office, classrooms, bathrooms, library and cafeteria.

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Mott Hall offers Spanish as a language elective.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Mott Hall offers Professional Development for all personnel staff who have direct contact with the school (including Para 
Professionals; ESL Teachers; Speech Therapists; Physical Therapists; Occupational Therapists;Secretaries and Parent 
Coordinators; scretaries) The Principal, Mr B Basile together with Mr J Jeanty introduce the ELL students' names and their 
proficiency levels early on.    In house Professional Development might have the school based coaches, Ms I Williams and Ms J 
Negron review the four stages of Second Language Acquisition (i.e. Pre-Production; Early Production; Speech Emergence; 
Intermediate Fluency). They present  instructional activities relavant to each stage.  Teachers then devlop activities that would 
be appropriate and relevant for each of the stages.  A Calendar of future Professional Devlopement days that will cover more 
in depth aspects of ENL are shared.  An Email from the Division of English Language Learners and Student Support Services are 
forwarded to encourage outside opportunities for NYC DOE Educators learn more about ENL. Leadership Institues course for 
Teachers of ELLs; and a Guidance on Implementing the Amended Comissioner's Regulation (CR) Part 154 for ELLs is offered 
with easy on line registration .  In addition to informational courses, the email presents opportunities for NYS Certification in 
PK-12 English as a Second Language; as well opportunities for ELL youth (ie Application for the 2015 Angelo del Tor 
HispanicYouth Leadership Institute (ie skills learn about the Senate; debating; writing skills;).  The American Institute for
