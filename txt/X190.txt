Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement: We are a collaborative school community dedicated to improving our students’ academic 
performance while fostering their physical, mental, social, and emotional growth. We provide a nurturing 
environment, standards and data driven instruction to address the needs of each student. Through continued 
collaboration of parents, administrators, staff, and community-based organizations, we will prepare every student to 
meet the needs of an ever-changing society. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Vision Statement: We envision that each student values education, holds high personal and educational expectations, 
is accountable for his or her own learning, communicates effectively, excels in all areas, connects school and real life 
situations and develops into a life-long learner. 

The mission statement exemplifies the commitment of every member of E.S.M.T. – I. S. 190 to address the needs of 
our students and to prepare them for the future. Our vision demonstrates the high expectations we have for each 
student. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Environmental Science, Mathematics and Technology School – Intermediate School 190 (E.S.M.T. - I. S. 190) is 
located in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, New York . The school shares the building with Francisco Oller - 
Community School 61 (C.S. 61). We are located on the fifth floor of the building. 

We offer the following academic subject areas: English Language Arts (ELA), Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, 
Physical/Health Education, Theatre Arts, and Spanish. We enrich and supplement our school curriculum with special 
programs and initiatives. Thus, we are able to provide enrichment activities through After School Academy, 
C.H.A.M.P.S./ Police Athletic League Program, Urban Advantage, Urban Park Rangers, New York Edge ( formerly Sports 
and Arts in Schools Foundation), The Pierre Matisse Foundation, guidance and counseling, and educational trips. 

As part of the college and career readiness, three Regents courses are offered in Grade 8: Algebra 1 (Common Core), 
U.S. History and Government, and Living Environment. One hundred percent of 8th graders who took Algebra 1 
(Common Core) passed the June 2018 Regents Exam. Ninety-two percent of the students who took Living 
Environment Regents Exam passed while 87% passed the U.S. History and Government Regents Exam. As a result, 
32% of our 8th graders earned from two to six high school credits. The names of colleges and universities where our 
teachers graduated are displayed throughout the school to emphasize the importance of college education. Our 
school participated in the College Access for All Middle School Initiative during 2017 - 2018 school year. The seven 
grade students received class instruction on college readiness once a week from January 2018 to April 2018. They also 
visited several colleges and universities in New York and New Jersey through the initiative. 

To maintain an environment that is safe and conducive to learning, we have developed and implemented the Positive 
Behavior and Supports (PBIS) initiative for the past six years. Expectations on how to be Safe, Organized, Accountable, 
and Respectful (SOAR) in every area of the school are taught and reinforced throughout the school year. In addition to 
PBIS initiative, we have been implementing the Leader in Me program since September 2014. The program was 
created to introduce students to the principles in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens. Through the use of the 7 
Habits, students begin to realize that they have control over much of what happens in their lives and that they can be 
true leaders. Leadership is a concept we don't normally consider when thinking of students; however, we believe that 
students are very capable of learning leadership skills and using them at home and at school. By developing well-
rounded students who know their strengths, we help them unleash their individual worth and potential to lead their 
own lives and to influence others. 

Restorative Circles initiative is going to be implemented this school year to help the school prevent or deal with 
conflict before it escalates. The circle process enables a group to get to know one another, build relationships and 
establish understanding and trust, create a sense of community and learn how to make decisions together. Circles can 
be effective as both a prevention and intervention strategy. Staff members are undergoing training for the effective 
implementation of this initiative. 

One of the Community Based Organizations that support family and community engagement in our school is New 
York Edge (formerly Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation). New York Edge offers after school program in different 
areas - academic, sports, arts, technology, and leadership skills. It prepares our students to face academic and social 
challenges in middle school and beyond. It provides our students with the tools and resources to help them and their 
families achieve their goals. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

ESMT - I. S. 190 has also partnership with the Urban Advantage (UA). UA is a standards-based partnership program 
designed to improve students understanding of scientific inquiry through collaboration between urban public school 
systems and science cultural institutions such as zoos, botanical gardens, museums, and science centers. 

We received a five-year arts grant from The Pierre Matisse Foundation to enrich our existing arts program starting this 
school year. Our goal is to develop an arts program that is an extension and beyond our current theatre arts program. 
We will employ both conventional and non-conventional pedagogical methodologies that are purposefully crafted to 
include end products that feature drama, dance, music and visual arts through digital and traditional approaches. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

ESMT - I. S. 190 is a sixth to eighth grade middle school that serves a population of approximately 275 students: 
Hispanic (188) - 68.36%, Black (79) - 28.73%, Asian (4) - 1.45%, Native Americans (2) - 0.73%, White (1) - 0.36%, and 
Multi-Racial (1) - 0.36 

Our special student populations comprise of Students With Disabilities (SWDs) - 21.82% and English Language 
Learners (ELLs) - 12.73%. These two groups of students have different as well as similar specific needs.  

The 2017 NYS ELA and Mathematics Common Core Tests show that SWDs score increased from 2% to 7.5% in ELA, but 
decreased from 6.1% to 6.0% in Mathematics. Although 21.7% of ELLs became proficient in 2017 NYSESLAT Tests, this 
subgroup did not show improvement in the 2017 ELA Common Core Tests. ELLs score in Mathematics increased from 
0.0% to 4.5%. 

The 2018 NYS ELA and Mathematics Common Core Tests show that SWDs score increased from 7.5% to 11.9% in ELA 
and from 6.0% to 10.0% in Mathematics. Although the ELLs subgroup's score increased from 4.5% to 9.5% in 2018 NYS 
Mathematics Test, it remained 0.0% in 2018 NYS ELA Test. However, this subgroup showed progress on 2018 
NYSESLAT Tests - from 21.7% to 34.8%. 

Upon analysis of the 2018 ELA and Mathematics tests results and 2018 Measure of Student Performance Tasks 
(MOSL), it was found out that both groups, like other subgroups had difficulty with constructed-response questions, 
reading comprehension, citing textual evidence when making claims and inferences, writing essays, and grasping 
abstract concepts.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As per 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide Report, we made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction. Our school's 
score increased from 3.00 to 3.27. Although our scores in Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership, 
Supportive Environment, and Trust decreased, we are still meeting the target. 

Collaborative Teachers and Strong Family-Community Ties are our key areas of focus this school year. The 2017-2018 
School Quality Guide shows that we scored 2.77 in Strong Family-Community Ties Framework Element, which is 
equivalent to approaching target. This is our lowest score among the six Framework Elements.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide shows that E.S.M.T. - I.S. 190 made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction. 
Our score increased from 3.00 to 3.27. This score came from the results of 2017 - 2018 Quality Review and NYC School 
Survey. Quality Review indicator 1.2 - Pedagogy was our area of celebration. It states that "Across classrooms, 
teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect shared beliefs about how students learn best that is 
informed by the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Students engage in frequent discussions and support each 
other's work products through peer feedback. Student work products and discussions reflect high levels of student 
thinking and participation through leveraging technology, small group iinstruction, and collaborative teaching 
practices." As a result, we achieved a proficient rating in this indicator. As per 2017 - 2018 NYC School Survey, our 
school's score is 4.07. This is the highest score among the Framework elements in the survey. 

A three-year trend analysis of student performance data on state assessments was conducted. The NYS School Report 
Cards show that based on the 2016 and 2017 NYS English Language Arts (ELA) Common Core Tests, the Students with 
Disabilities (SWDs) subgroup did not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Although the 2018 NYS ELA score 
increased from 7.5% to 11.9%, the result is not sufficient for this subgroup to meet the AYP again.  

Although ELLs has not been an accountability subgroup for the past years, it greatly affected the scores of other 
subgroups because most ELLs, like SWDs, belong to at least three subgroups. The ELLs scored 0.0% for two 
consecutive years - 2017 and 2018 NYS ELA Tests respectively. The 2016 NYSESLAT Tests shows that no ELLs became 
proficient while the 2017 NYSESLAT Tests shows that 21.7% are on proficient level. The ELLs made progress again on 
the 2018 NYSESLAT Tests 

Through the analysis, it was determined that both SWDs and ELLs have underperformed all other accountability 
subgroups for the past three years. Consequently, we have made progress for our SWDs and ELLs subgroups as one of 
the goals for 2018 - 2019. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

By June 2019, we will have increased proficiency in our SWDs and ELLs subgroups as evidenced by a 5% increase in the 
percentage of students scoring at or above Level 3, from 11.9% to 16.9% for SWDs and from 0.0% to 5.0% for ELLs as 
measured by the 2019 NYS ELA Test.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Academic Intervention Services (AIS) will be provided to all 
SWDs, ELLs, and other high-need student subgroups through 
small-group and one-to-one instruction during and after school 
hours 

Professional learning activities will be differentiated based on 
teacher needs and feedback during grade and departmental 
meetings. In addition to workshops offered by the NYC DOE, UFT, 
and other organizations, professional learning opportunities that 
enable teachers of SWDs and ELLs to engage in rigorous 
instructional practices will be provided in-house by the 
administrators, instructional leads, master teachers, and 
consultants.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
To maintain an environment that is safe and conducive to learning, we have developed and implemented the Positive 
Behavior and Supports (PBIS) initiative for the past six years. Expectations on how to be Safe, Organized, Accountable, 
and Respectful (SOAR) in every area of the school are taught and reinforced throughout the school year. 

In addition to the PBIS initiative, we have implemented The Leader in Me program for the last three years. The 
program was created to introduce students to the principles in The 7 Habits of Effective Teens. Through the use of the 
7 Habits, students begin to realize that they have control over much of what happens in their lives and that they can 
be true leaders. Leadership is a concept we don't normally consider when thinking of students; however, we believe 
that students are very capable of learning leadership skills and using them at home and at school. By developing well-
rounded students who know their strengths, we help them unleash their individual worth and potential to lead their 
own lives and to influence others in positive ways. 

Referrals of behavior problems are recorded in SWIS. Upon analysis of the 2018 SWIS Report, we found out that the 
highest reported infractions happened in the classroom. In addition, only 50% of students had positive responses 
concerning classroom behavior on the 2017 - 2018 NYC School Survey. This is equivalent to a score of 2.00. This is one 
area that we need to improve. Consequently, we scored 2.96 out of 4.99 in Supportive Environment as indicated on 
the 2017 - 2018 NYC School Survey.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school's score on Supportive Environment will have increased from 2.96 to 3.10 as measured by the 
2018-2019 NYC School Survey by maintaining a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, 
students, and families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The school will enhance the quality of implementation of the 
Leader in Me/PBIS initiatives by creating a team of student 
leaders to help maintain a school environment that is safe and 
conducive to learning. 

Continue to provide training to all staff, parents, and students for 
effective implementation of "The Leader in Me" program.  

Provide learning opportunities for teachers, students, and 
parents to understand the New York City Department of 
Education (NYCDOE) measures that most closely align to 
Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment. 
It includes, but is not limited to selected components of Quality 
Review, Danielson Framework for Teaching, and NYC School 
Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Teachers have a greater impact on student success than any other school factor as decades of research have proven. 
In order to successfully implement the key elements detailed in the Framework for Great Schools, school communities 
must develop a shared understanding of what effective instructions look like.  

Quality Review Indicators 4.1 and 4.2 are aligned with Collaborative Teachers Framework Element. The school 
received Proficient ratings in both indicators from the 2017-2018 Quality Review. Quality Review Indicator 4.1 
indicated that "Effective observation feedback and analysis of student work and data articulate clear expectations for 
teacher practice and support teacher development." Indicator 4.2 stated that Collaborative teams promote the 
achievement of school goal and strengthen the instructional capacity of teachers through the sharing of practices and 
discussions of student work. Teachers have a voice in key decisions that affect student learning across the school and 
are building leadership capacity through instructional lead positions." 

The average percentage of teachers and students who agreed or strongly agreed to the questions related to 
Collaborative teachers in the 2018 NYC School Survey was 83%. The Collaborative Teachers Element measures include 
the following: 

  Cultural awareness and inclusive classroom instruction, 
  Quality of professional development  
 
  Peer collaboration and Collective Responsibility 

School commitment 

As per 2017-2018 School Quality Guide Report, we scored 3.41 in Collaborative Teacher Element, which is equivalent 
to meeting the target for the year. This is our highest score among the six Framework Elements. 

We received Proficient ratings in QR 4.1 and 4.2, but Developing rating in QR 2.1. This is one of our areas of focus for 
this school year. The QR findings stated that "The school is developing in their use of common assessments to 
measure and track student progress toward goals across grades and subject areas. Across classrooms, teachers' 
assessment practices inconsistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding and student self-assessment, 
so that not all teachers are making effective adjustments to meet all students' learning needs." For next steps, it was 
suggested that the school should develop and use common assessments to measure and track student progress. To 
track student progress, we are going to use a data tracking tool to record the student performance on common 
assessments such as the NYS ELA and Mathematics Tests, Baseline Assessments, Periodic Assessments, and Measures 
of Student Learning (MOSL). It will be an important tool to support the school's goal of increasing the number of 
students achieving proficiency levels on the NYS ELA and Mathematics Tests. The teachers will collaboratively analyze 
formative and summative assessment data and record them on the data tracking tool to measure and track student 
progress across content areas.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teacher teams will have collaboratively analyzed formative and summative assessment data to continue 
the cycle of inquiry that will result in at least 5% increase in all students scoring at the proficiency levels, from 35.3% to 
40.3% in ELA and from 19.4% to 24.4% in Mathematics, as measured by the 2019 NYS ELA and Mathematics Tests.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Quality Review Indicators 1.3 - Leveraging Resources, 3.1 - Goals and Action Plans, and 5.1 - Monitoring and Revising 
Systems are aligned with Effective School Leadership Framework Element. Our school received Proficient ratings in all 
three indicators. In addition, we received also Proficient rating in QR 4.1 - Teacher Support and Supervision. The 
findings stated that "School leaders support the development of teachers with effective feedback and next steps from 
frequent cycles of classroom observation and analysis of student work and data. Feedback accurately captures 
strengths and growth along with next steps aligned to the Danielson Frameqork for Teaching. Teachers reported that 
feedback is "timely' and that leaders conduct follow-up observations to see a next step implemented." The 2017-2018 
School Quality Guide Report shows that we scored a total of 3.27 on this Framework Element. Although there is a 
decrease of 0.71 points, we are still meeting target and this is our second highest score among the six Framework 
Elements. The total score of 3.27 is the combined average score from Quality Review and NYC School Survey. 

An analysis of the End of Year Rating of teachers show that on average, 26% of teachers received Developing rating on 
three components of Domain 3: 3b - Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3c - Engaging Students in 
Learning, and 3d - Using Assessment in Instruction. Quality Review Indicator 2.1 is about assessment. We received a 
developing rating on this indicator. The QR findings stated that "The school is developing in their use of common 
assessments to measure and track student progress toward goals across grades and subject areas. Across classrooms, 
teachers' assessment practices inconsistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding and student self-
assessment, so that not all teachers are making effective adjustments to meet all students' learning needs." 

To support teachers as we continue to implement higher standards using the Common Core, school administrators 
will continue to use the Danielson Framework for Teaching to serve as the tool for teacher development and 
evaluation. The focus will be on Domain 3 of the Framework which aligns with Quality Review 2.1. In addition, the 
administrators will provide more frequent, formative, actionable, and time bound feedback to help teachers grow as 
professionals, thus providing even higher levels of support for teacher learning that will impact student achievement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, administrators will have provided research-based professional development workshops that are 
applicable to current school community's needs and to strengthened teacher pedagogy as measured by a 15% increase 
in teachers improving one performance level in Domain 3 of Danielson Framework for Teaching.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In collaboration with the Parent Association (PA), Parent Coordinator, and Family Worker, the teachers have been 
successful in maintaining an open line of communication between parents and the school community. The Parental 
Engagement period every Tuesday is being utilized to invite parents to have one-to-one conferences with the 
teachers. Communication between school and home is also done through telephone calls, letters, and emails. Every 
teacher maintains logs of their calls and conferences with parents.  

The attendance records of the four Parent-Teacher Conferences held last year showed that on average, 65% of the 
parents attended the conferences, which was an increase of 15% from the previous year. The 2017-2018 NYC School 
Survey showed that parents' participation in the survey increased from 89% to 92%. 

We received a rating of proficient in indicator 3.4 of 2017-2018 Quality Review Rubric - "How effectively does the 
school partner with families to support student success?" The findings indicated that "School leaders consistently 
communicate high expectations for professionalism and instruction to the entire staff. Teacher teams and staff 
establish a culture for learning that consistently communicates high expectations for all students. There is a 
communication of and support for families' understanding of high expectations for college and career readiness." 

The Parent Coordinator, in collaboration with the administrators, teachers, and Parent Association (PA) conducted 
workshops every month. Parents and families were invited to attend to school events and activities such as 
award/honor assembly, cultural awareness celebration, PA meetings, SLT meetings, and educational trips. On 
average, parents' attendance to workshops and school events was approximately 10%. The 2018 NYC School Survey 
shows that our score in this Framework Element decreased from 3.28 to 2.64, which is approaching target. This is our 
lowest score among the six Framework Elements. Upon analysis of the survey questions and answers on Parent 
Involvement in School, we found out that only 77% of parents agreed or strongly agreed that they have had 
opportunity for parent involvement in the school. This is the main factor for the decrease of our score in this 
Framework Element. As a result, parent involvement in school will be one of our priority needs this school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will have provided learning opportunities, activities, and events aimed at increasing parent 
involvement in the school which will result in a 8% increase, from 77% to 85%, in the percentage of parents who will 
agree or strongly agree that they have had the opportunity for parent involvement in the school as measured by the 
results of 2019 NYC School Survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. E.S.M.T. – I. S. 190 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.. 

 

E.S.M.T. – I. S. 190 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA, State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
All ELLs new to the NYC DOE are given the NYSITELL in order to determine their English language proficiency  and the Spanish 
LAB in order to determine their Spanish language proficiency.  Twice per year, the ELL Benchmark assessment is given, as well 
as NYC Performance Assessments (MOSL)  in core subject areas.  Our school uses Gates MacGinitie Reading Tests to assess the 
early literacy skills of our ELLs each fall and spring.  We also use the San Diego Quick and Fountas and Pinnell to obtain a 
baseline level and then conduct these assessments two more times during the year to track progress.  In addition, the i-Ready 
reading program is used to assess literacy skills and provide individualized, direct instruction based upon student need. The 
language skills of all incoming ELLs are assesses as per the procedures in the ELL Policy and Reference Guide (EPRG).  In 
addition, periodic assessments, baseline, and benchmark exams are administered according to the NYCDOE testing calendar.  
These assessments provide both baseline and ongoing data relating to individual ELL progress in the four modalities of reading, 
writing, listening, and speaking and provides us with a wealth of information about our ELLs' reading literacy skills including 
accuracy, fluency, comprehension and phonemic awareness, phonics, letter learning, and high frequency word 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

knowledge.  This data is used to guide instructional planning during teacher team meetings, departmental meetings, and 
monthly ELL Liaison meetings.  This information helps inform our schools instructional plans and shared with all of the ELL 
teachers so that instruction can be rigorous and differentiated, as well as aligned to standards for these students in all content 
areas.  A review of the quantitative data available on our students shows that many ELLs are on reading levels that are one to 
three grades behind their actual grade.  
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The language skills of all incoming ELLs are assessed, as per the procedures in the ELL Policy and Reference Guide (EPRG).  In 
addition, periodic assessments, baseline and benchmark exams are administered according to the NYCDOE testing 
calendar.  This data provides us with a wealth of information about our ELLs' reading literacy skills including accuracy, fluency, 
comprehension and phonemic awareness, phonics, letter learning, and high frequency word knowledge.   
 
This data is used to guide instructional planning during weekly teacher team meetings, weekly departmental meetings, and 
monthly ELL Liaison meetings.  The ENL teacher collaborates with content-area teachers during the weekly team meetings, as 
well as the weekly departmental meetings.  This weekly collaboration includes the review of ELL assessment data and utilizing 
this information to inform our schools instructional plan so that instruction can be rigorous and differentiated, as well as 
aligned to standards for these students in all content areas.  A review of the quantitative data available on our students shows 
that many ELLs are on reading levels that are one to three grades behind their actual grade.  teracy skills including accuracy, 
fluency, comprehension and phonemic awareness, phonics, letter learning, and high frequency word knowledge.  This data is 
used to guide instructional planning during teacher team meetings, departmental meetings, and monthly ELL Liaison 
meetings.  This information helps inform our schools instructional plans and shared with all of the ELL teachers so that 
instruction can be rigorous and differentiated, as well as aligned to standards for these students in all content areas.  A review 
of the quantitative data available on our students shows that many ELLs are on reading levels that are one to three grades 
behind their actual grade.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs based on the gains and success they obtain on baseline/benchmark and 
summative assessments such as the periodic assessments, NYSESLAT, and NYS ELA, Math, and Science tests.  In addition, we 
also take into consideration the students' class work, portfolios, report cards, teachers' observations, parental and student 
feedback about our program.  We refer to NYS School Report Card to determine whether or not the ELLs meet their AYP.  We 
also refer to NYC School Quality Guide to determine the progress made by ELLs.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

E.S.M.T.-I.S. 190 offers a variety of interventions, focusing on ENL, ELA, and math skills, which are in place to address 
interventions for ELLs.  These interventions include: 
 
-ELA After School Academy:  This After School Academy meets by grade level, on a weekly basis, and targets core ELA skills. 
-Math After School Academy:  This After School Academy meets by grade level, on a weekly basis, and targets core math skills. 
-ENL After School Academy:  This After School Academy meets on a weekly basis and targets core ENL skills relating to reading, 
writing, listening and speaking. 
-i-Ready Reading and Math Programs:  i-Ready is an adaptive assessment, that uses  technology to provide a deep, customized 
evaluation of every student and to track student growth and performance consistently and continuously.  The program 
dynamically adapts based on student response patterns and this allows the assessments to accurately and efficiently pinpoint 
students’ needs. 
-Matheletics and Math XL: Technology-based math intervention programs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

RTI and AIS support services are considered for ELLs who score below Expanding on the NYSESLAT, taking into account the 
following information: 
 
-Number of years of instruction in an ENL program 
-English and home language literacy 
-Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE) 
-English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs 
-Results on the NYSESLAT 
-ENL teacher recommendations 
-Content area teacher recommendations 
-Parent or guardian request 
-Sample of student work in English and, if possible, their home language 
-Bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has or is suspected of having a disability 
 
The support services provided are aligned to the AIS intervention plan ESMT-I.S. 190 is providing to all students.  Tier I RTI and 
AIS support for ELLs is provided by the content area teachers.  Tier II and Tier III support and intervention is provided by an 
additional teacher. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The  ATS RLAT report is used to access each student's ENL proficiency level, history and progress by modality, and to determine 
the  necessary  mandate of  ENL minutes and setting.  In addition, the ELL Data Analysis tool is used to further identify areas of 
strength and concern for each ELL, relating to ELA and math state test results.  This data is analyzed on an ongoing basis in 
order to program and group the ELLs and former ELLs for the mandated weekly minutes of standalone and/or integrated ENL 
instruction.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The RLAT and EDAT are reviewed by the ELL Coordinator on an ongoing basis.  This data is used to make initial ENL 
programming decisions, as well as to make necessary adjustments to the existing ENL program.  This information is 
disseminated, as necessary, so that teacher programs and STARS can be updated.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ESMT- I. S. 190 has a Freestanding ENL program in which instruction is delivered to ELLs in a combination of stand-
alone and integrated instruction.  Stand-alone ENL is instruction designed to develop English language skills so that 
students can succeed in content courses.  Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content 
area instruction.  
 
As per CR Part 154.2, all ELLs and former ELLs (up to 2 years after exiting ELL status) must receive a minimum number 
of units of stand-alone and/or integrated ENL instruction.  Entering ELLs receive 360 minutes (180 stand-alone, 180 
integrated ELA), Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes (90 stand-alone, 180 integrated ELA, 90 stand-alone or 
integrated-other content area), Transitioning ELLs receive 180 minutes (90 integrated ELA, 90 integrated-other 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

content area), Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes (180 integrated ELA or other content area), and commanding ELLs 
receive 90 minutes (ENL or other content area).   At ESMT-I.S.-190, stand-alone and integrated ENL instruction of all 
current and former ELLs is programmed by proficiency level, in accordance with CR Part 154.2.  The stand-alone 
instruction is delivered by the ENL teacher, and the structure of the integrated instruction is one ENL teacher and one 
subject-area teacher, per class.  The program models are Ungraded and Homogeneous for stand-alone instruction and 
Block and Heterogeneous for integrated instruction.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 ESMT - I. S. 190 ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels by 
placing all general education ELLs in one class per 6th, 7th, and 8th grade level as well as all special education ELLs in one class 
per 6th, 7th, and 8th grade levels.  Through this arrangement, the ENL teacher can provide them with their mandated number 
of minutes 
 a.  Explicit ENL instructional minutes are delivered through standalone and integrated instruction.  Integrated instruction is 
provided during ELA, Mathematics, and Social Studies instructional periods. The RLAT report is printed from ATS  and students 
are programmed and provided with their mandated ENL instructional minutes and setting, based on their levels of proficiency 
(360 minutes/ standalone and integrated for entering and emerging, 180 minutes standalone/integrated for transitioning, 180 
minutes integrated for expanding, 90 minutes integrated for commanding) during ELA, Mathematics, and Social Studies 
instructional periods during the week.  This information is then entered into STARS, and updated when necessary. 
NLA supports are provided during the instructional periods in these subject areas using materials that are grade and age 
appropriate that are aligned with the school’s curriculum and state standards.  In addition to native language materials, the 
ENL teacher and paraprofessionals provide native language support orally and with explanations.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All content is delivered to the students in English along with a variety of ENL strategies including an emphasis on key 
vocabulary and visual supports.  In our block scheduling program model, students travel together to 45 minute periods for all 
content area classes including Science, Social Studies, French, Theater Arts and Gym. However, there are double blocks of 90 
minutes for ELA and Mathematics.  An example schedule for an ENL student at our school would show two ninety minute 
blocks of both ELA and Math, one forty five minute period of science, social studies, Spanish, and Theatre Arts.  All instruction 
is given in English, though native language support is present in the classroom to help make content comprehensible.  Native 
language support occurs through students who speak the same native language, support staff that speaks the student’s 
language, dictionaries, glossaries and books that are grade and age appropriate that are aligned with the school’s curriculum 
and state standards.  Many of the student textbooks used in our school have translated copies in Spanish which provided 
further native language support.  The Total Physical Response (TPR) Approach, Language Experience Approach and Balanced 
Literacy Approach are used to serve the needs of the ELLs.  In addition, scaffolding techniques including modeling, 
contextualization, prior knowledge, schema building, visual aids, graphic organizers and guided practice are used to make 
content comprehensible and support the language development of the ELLs in ENL and content-area classes.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, the Spanish LAB-1982 is administered to the students, 
when necessary.  As we have a Freestanding ENL Program, all instruction and assessment is in English.  However, translated 
versions of the citywide and state assessments are requested and provided to ELLs as needed. They are also provided with 
bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries.  In addition, the Spanish Proficiency Examination is administered to 8th graders in June. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated for all students including ELLs and has a specific plan for each subgroup.  Instruction for ELLs is 
differentiated according to their proficiency levels and individual needs.  a. Our staff is trained to identify SIFE students using 
the Multi-Lingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS).  The MLS is a state-wide diagnostic tool that was created to determine SIFEs' 
literacy levels in their home language in order to provide or to design appropriate instruction for these students.  We also 
assess the students using the Fountas and Pinnell system, as well as the Gates MacGinitie Reading Tests to determine the 
students reading level and comprehension and to provide us information about the students' writing abilities.  The data, in 
addition to teacher observations and assessments, is used to set individual goals for this student.  Depending on the students 
proficiency in their native language, native language support materials will be used to provide support to student. Instruction 
in the classroom will be differentiated to suit the needs of SIFE students, while still maintaining academic rigor. b. Our 
instructional plan for newcomer ELLs in school less than three years is to provide both integrated and standalone ENL 
instruction targeted toward vocabulary, reading comprehension and writing development.  Since ELLs take the ELA state test 
after one year, support these ELLs by familiarizing them with the ELA testing format and vocabulary while using guided 
scaffolded instruction that integrates strategies and skills similar to those required on the exam.  This instruction for ELLs is 
differentiated according to their proficiency levels and individual needs. c. Our instructional plan to help move 
developing  ELLs, receiving 4 to 6 years of service, to commanding level is by using assessment data (from the NYSESLAT, ELL 
Periodic Assessments, New York State Tests, STAR Classroom, alternative assessments and observations) to identify student 
weaknesses and strengths that will drive differentiated rigorous instruction across all content areas.  The data will be used in 
goal setting across all content areas.  Trends have shown that ELLs in this subgroup at our school tend to need interventions in 
reading and writing which  is taken into consideration when teachers are planning their lessons. d. Our instructional plan to 
move Long-Term ELLs to proficiency is by using assessment data (from the NYSESLAT, ELL Periodic Assessments, New York 
State Tests, alternative assessments and observations) to identify student weaknesses and strengths to drive differentiated 
rigorous instruction across all content areas.  All Long-Term ELL data is carefully reviewed and used to target very specific skills 
or areas in need of improvement.  If certain interventions or instructional strategies are not effective they will be addressed by 
the ENL and content area teachers.  This information will be used to set individual goals across all content areas. e. For at least 
two years following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status, former ELLs receive at least one half of one 
unit of study of English as a new language (90 minutes per week).  In order to best serve our former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after 
testing commanding) we take into account the styles and settings in which these students learn best and differentiate 
instruction to meet their needs. We also utilize technology-based programs, such as i-Ready, that are engaging and challenging 
for each  student.  They are provided the same testing accomodations as ELLs. All ELLs and former ELLs, for up to two years 
after testing out, are eligible for ELL testing accommodations, in addition to any accommodations on their IEPs or 504 Plans, if 
applicable. ESMT-IS 190 provides testing accommodations to ELLs, on all NYS ELA and content-area assessments (i.e., 
mathematics, science and social studies). Testing accommodations for ELL students include the following: •Time extension (all 
exams): time and a half• Separate location (all exams) NYS assessments may be administered to ELLs in small groups in a 
separate location. • Bilingual word-for-word dictionaries and/or glossaries:  ELLs may use bilingual word-for-word dictionaries 
and/or glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects except languages other than English exams (LOTE).• 
Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions of State examinations.  In cases of low incidence languages for 
which there is no translation available, oral translations will be arranged.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELLs-SWDs ensure that students have access to the curriculum by using various strategies in the classroom.  These 
strategies include, but are not limited to, visual supports, graphic organizers, vocabulary scaffolding, charts and small-group 
work.  Both general education as well as special education teachers scaffold and differentiate the materials being presented in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

class to meet each individual student’s needs.  The teachers collaborate regularly to plan and implement the strategies 
necessary in the classroom.  Based on students’ learning styles, teachers plan accordingly to make the greatest impact on 
learning.  The team meets weekly to discuss any changes that are made to IEPs that may affect classroom instruction.  The 
special education team also collaborates at the weekly meetings to share best practices and teaching strategies so that 
students can access the curriculum and be academically and socially successful.  The special education department ensures 
that the special education students receive their mandated ENL services by staying up to date with what is required as per the 
IEP and ensuring that each student is in the appropriate program.   Although we do not currently have any ELL-SWDs whose 
IEP mandates bilingual instruction, if this does occur, the appropriate steps will be taken to ensure that the mandated services 
are provided.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
To meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment, the following initiatives are being 
implemented: 
- ENL instruction through integrated co-teaching and standalone instruction, as determined by the proficiency level of each 
ELL. 
- AIS push-in model, targeted RtI, Flexible Child Study Team, least restrictive environment/mainstreaming, sharing of best 
practices through intervisitations. 
- The special education works diligently to regularly analyze academic and behavioral student data to determine if students are 
in their least restrictive environment.  Each individual is provided a schedule that reflects their academic needs so that they 
can meet their IEP goals and be challenged by the curriculum while still receiving the necessary support. Students at our school 
may have a flexible schedule in which they are always in the least restrictive environment as it pertains to their academic 
needs. The Special Education team uses their weekly meetings to discuss progress and ultimately recommends changes to 
IEPs at annual review meetings with parents. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Currently, all ELLs are receiving intervention services in all content areas during school hours.  All the programs are offered in 
English. The students are provided with bilingual dictionaries and if necessary, an interpreter.  ELLs who fall under the state-
mandated cut-off scale scores in 2017 NYS ELA and Mathematics Common Core Tests will be receiving academic intervention 
services. In ELA, Imagine Learning, a computer-based program is being used to focus on improving literacy of ELLs.  Mathletics 
and MathXL, also computer-based programs, will be used in mathematics. ELLs who are in the lowest one-third citywide in the 
2017  NYC End-of-Year Performance Assessments are targeted to receive academic intervention services in writing.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the 2017 NYS ELA and math state test scores, we are going to effectively implement the targeted intervention 
programs mentioned in (8).  Every targeted student is assigned to a teacher in order to receive academic intervention services 
in all content areas. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At ESMT-I.S. 190, ELLs are encouraged to participate in all school programs.  All information relating to after school and 
supplemental services is in the parents' preferred home language, thus affording ELLs equal access to all school 
programs.  These include ENL, ELA, and Math after school academies, the Sports and Arts after school program, and CHAMPS. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

The following curriculum/programs are used in the content areas: ELA - Expeditionary Learning; Mathematics - Connected 
Mathematics (CMP3); Social Studies - Holt MacDougal Social Studies; Science - Glencoe New York Science.  Furthermore, we 
provide ELLs with additional instructional materials that are suited to their levels such as reading books, both in English and 
Spanish, bilingual dictionaries, and translated edition of the textbooks.  The computer-based program, i-Ready, is being used 
for general literacy development and it is accessed via iPad, desktop or laptop computer.  Additional technology used in all 
classrooms includes SMART Boards, projectors, document cameras, iPads, and laptop computers, in order to provide audio and 
visual scaffolds for the ELLs.  In addition, these materials and devices provide additional methods and means for ELLs to build 
and develop the four modalities of reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native Language support is provided through texts that are available in both English and the students’ native language.  Also, 
our school uses bilingual dictionaries or glossaries, oral translations, explanations or comprehension assessments offered by 
teachers and paraprofessionals.  Spanish-speaking ELLs are given the Spanish LAB in order to assess Spanish literacy and our 
school has a variety of reading materials in Spanish that are grade and age appropriate and are aligned with state standards. 
Reading materials are also available in French.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

To ensure that required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels, the following 
curriculum/programs are used in the content areas: ELA - TC Reading & Writing Workshop; Mathematics - Connected 
Mathematics (CMP3); Social Studies - Holt MacDougal Social Studies; Science - Glencoe New York Science.  Furthermore, we 
provide ELLs with additional instructional materials that are suited to their levels such as reading books, both in English and 
Spanish, bilingual dictionaries, and translated edition of the textbooks.  The computer-based program, i-Ready, is being used 
for general literacy development and it is accessed via iPad, desktop or laptop computer.  Additional technology used in all 
classrooms includes SMART Boards, projectors, document cameras, iPads, and laptop computers.  
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
ESMT-I.S. 190 shares a building with an elementary school, CS 61.  The two schools share the use of the cafeteria and the 
auditorium.  A schedule is in place to ensure that each school has adequate use of both of these locations.  In addition, the two 
schools  share the same psychologist, who is involved in issues relating to the socioemotional needs of the ELLs in both 
schools.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELL students receive information about our school during our new student orientation.  They meet the 
principal, assistant principal, parent coordinator, ENL coordinator, as well as their teachers.  They are given tour of the 
school.  Each student is assigned a buddy or school ambassador, who speaks the student’s native language, to help each new 
student adjust to our school environment. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Ongoing professional development workshops for all ELL personnel will be provided inside and outside the school. Fifteen 
percent of the required professional development hours for all teachers (including ELA, Math, Social Studies, Science, Spanish, 
Special Education, Theatre Arts and Physical Education), assistant principals, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, 
psychologists, speech therapists, secretaries, and parent coordinators will be ELL-specific.  Fifty percent  of the required 
professional development for the ENL teacher will be ELL-specific. The workshops inside the school will be conducted during 
the scheduled professional development periods after school hours on  Mondays and Tuesdays.  Whenever possible, teachers 
of ELLs will be sent to attend ELL-specific workshops offered outside of the school.    
 
To support teachers as we continue to implement the Common Core and the Framework for Great Schools, on-going 
professional development workshops for teachers will be conducted throughout the school year.  The workshops will be 
differentiated based on the needs of the teachers.  These workshops will have a positive and lasting impact on the teachers' 
performance in classrooms.  
 
The following professional development workshops will be conducted for the 2017-2018 school year: 
- Co-Teaching Institute for New Teachers 
- Co-Teaching Institute for Experienced Co-Teachers 
-Bilingual Special Education Institute: How does one Determine What is a Language Acquisition and What is a Disability? 
- UFT Bilingual Conference: Designing Effective ENL and Co-Teaching Programs 
- Literacy Institute: Planning Programs and Instruction for New Arrivals 
- Literacy Institute: Going Deeper with Academic Discourse, The Power of Conversational Skills to Support Language 
- NYS/NYC Teacher Institute: Enhancing Students' Academic Discussion Skills in the ENL Classroom 
- Literacy Institute: Building Oral Language, Promoting Listening and Speaking in the Classroom, Newcomers with Native 
Language Literacy 
- Literacy Institute: Working Towards Grade Level Standards, Developing Newcomers' Reading and Writing Skills, Newcomers 
with Limited Schooling 
 
Attendees will turn-key all information to teachers and administrators who are unable to attend. 
 
Another series of workshops will  be about "Classroom Instruction that Works with English Language Learners".  These 
workshops consists of nine research-based instructional strategies that proved to be exceptionally effective in increasing 
student performance. They are as follows: 
   - Setting objectives and providing feedback 
   - Nonliguistic representations 
   - Cues, questions, and advance organizers 
   - Cooperative learning 
   - Summarizing and note taking 
   - Homework and practice 
   - Reinforcing effort and providing recognition 
   - Generating and testing hypotheses 
   - Identifying similarities and differences. 
The Math Coach/Data Specialist & Test Coordinator will facilitate these workshops.  She received training on these strategies 
years ago.  The ENL teacher will continue to attend workshops for ELLs provided by the Office of English Language Learners as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

necessary.  She has attended many ELA and math workshops for ELLs for the last six years.  She will continue to turnkey those 
workshops to teachers of ELLs as needed.  The principal, assistant principal and instructional coaches will provide 
differentiated workshops to teachers, as necessary, on each domain and competency of Danielson Framework for Teaching 
throughout the school year. 
 
In addition, the ENL Coordinator will continue to attend monthly ELL Liaisons' meetings and disseminate all pertinent 
information to teachers and administrators of ESMT - I. S. 190.  Furthermore, as our school is implementing the Teachers 
College Reading and Writing Curriculum for the 2017-2018 school year, members of the ELA, Special Education, and ENL Teams 
will be attending ongoing professional development workshops provided by Teachers College.  
 
The mathematics teachers have been attending professional development workshops specific to ELLs given by the DOE STEM 
department. The mathematics teachers are members of the Algebra for All Initiative.  The school leadership and guidance 
counselor/social worker support the staff members and parent coordinator by communicating with ELLs and their parents 
regarding specific issues that need their attention and guidance.  Records of professional development workshops/training, 
including agendas and/or sign-in sheets, are maintained in the PD binder in the Principal's office.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
To assist ELLs as they transition from middle school to high school, the guidance counselor/social worker received professional 
development workshops such as, but not limited to, the following topics: High School Articulation, Response to Intervention, 
Gathering and Analyzing Student Data from Multiple Sources, and Inquiry Process. These workshops were turnkeyed to staff 
members. In addition, High School Articulation and Application Workshop for parents and students is conducted every year.  
 
First, the staff who needs the minimum hours of ELL training is identified at the beginning of the school year. The ELL training 
is  provided in and outside the school (15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for ENL teacher). The staff 
members are sent to ELLs workshops conducted outside the school whenever they are available. The assistant principal, 
instructional coaches,  ENL teacher,  Data Specialist, and other capacity builders in the school provide training inside the 
school. Records of professional development workshops/training are kept in the PD binder in the Principal's office.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher and relevant staff meets with the parents of ELLs, at least once per year, in addition to parent-teacher 
conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents or 
guardians, for an Annual ENL Parent Meeting.  During this time, the child's goals, progress, and needs in all content areas are 
discussed.  The meetings will be conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication 
that the parent best understands.  Records of the Annual ENL Parent Meetings are maintained in a log, while meeting sign-in 
sheets and discussion notes are kept in the ELL Binder of Critical Documents. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 1. Every effort is made to involve parents in the education of their children.  To increase parental engagement, including 
parents of ELLs, administrators, staff and Parent Coordinator will plan and implement the following strategies and activities 
during 2015-2016 school year. 
   - ELL teachers will conduct workshop for parents to help them understand the three program choices (Transitional Bilingual, 
Dual Language, Freestanding ENL) for ELLs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

   - The Data Specialist will conduct workshop to provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability 
system:  NCLB/State accountability system, student proficiency levels in NYSESLAT, ELA and Mathematics, Annual School 
Report Card, Quality Review Report, and Learning Environment Survey Report. 
   - Schedule parent meetings  with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening,  to share information about the 
school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions. These meetings 
will be conducted by the principal and/or assistant principal. 
   - Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed  
   -  Provide written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s 
progress 
   - Encourage meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent–Guardian Association and Title I Parent 
Committee. 
   - Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include parenting skills, understanding current educational issues such as 
the Common Core; literacy, mathematics,  accessing community and support services; and technology training to build 
parents’ capacity to help their children at home. 
  - Arrange opportunities for parents to receive training to volunteer and participate in their child's class and to observe 
classroom activities. 
   - Invite parents to participate in cultural celebrations such as Harvest Dance,  Hispanic Heritage Month, and  African-
American Month. 
   - Invite parents to participate in celebrating the academic achievement of their children during the Honor and Award 
Assembly four times a year. 
   - Conduct workshops about the citywide and state assessments: periodic assessments, NYSESLAT, NYS Common Core ELA, 
Mathematics, and Science Tests. The Test Coordinator, Literacy Coach, and Mathematics Coach will facilitate these workshops. 
The above-mentioned workshops/trainings will be conducted monthly, in collaboration with the Parent Association (PA). The 
parents will be notified of any forthcoming events/activities through letters, emails, and/or telephone calls. The 
written  communication will be translated in the language that parents can understand. 
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Although ELLs has not been an accountability subgroup for the past years, their results have greatly affected the scores of other 
subgroups because most ELLs belong to at least three subgroups. The 2015 and 2016 NYS ELA Common Core Tests results show 
that ELLs scored 0% on proficient level.  Consequently, we have made progress for ELLs subgroups as one of the CEP goals for 2017-
2018. 
 
As per the CEP Goal Section A - Rigorous Instruction: By June 2018, SWDs and ELLs subgroups will demonstrate progress towards 
achieving proficiency (Levels 3 and 4) in ELA as measured by a 5% increase in these subgroups scoring at Level 3 or 4 on the 
2018 NYS ELA Common Core Tests.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Castella Mckenzie, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data from the following documents are used to assess language preferences of the parents for both written 
and oral communication: 

* Student Registration Form - Completed by the school or enrollment office during the point of initial admissions. 

* Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) - Completed by all parents during the point of initial enrollment. 

* Emergency Contact (Blue Card) - Completed by all parents at the beginning of every school year, upon 
enrollment in a new school, and updated as needed. 

The following ATS reports are also used to generate the Parents' Preferred Language Reports: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

* School Level Emergency Contact Form (RCPL) 

* School Level Emergency Contact Student List (RCON) 

* School Level Adult Preferred Language report (RAPL) 

* School Level Adult Detail Report (RADL) 

Throughout the school year, the Language Access Coordinator (LAC) will regularly generate and review up-to-date 
ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for parents in the school. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
