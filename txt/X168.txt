Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At P168X, we believe that we are all lifelong learners. We will work to develop students academically, socially, and 
emotionally to become active participants in their community. We are committed to providing a safe environment 
where all stakeholders collaborate to foster independence for all.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P168X is a District 75 school educating 530 students with Individual Educational Programs. We have 7 sites 
throughout the Bronx and serve students from Pre-K to 12 th grade. Class ratios include 12:1+1, 8:1+1, 6:1+1, 8:1+2, 
and 9:1+3. All class ratios serve standardized and alternate assessment students. The school population is comprised 
of 61% Hispanic students, 34% Black students, 1% White students, and 3% Asian students with 23% of the student 
population English as a New Language learners. The 2017-2018 average attendance rate was 84%.  

In order to support the Framework Element of Collaborative Teachers, from 2014-2016, P168X was a Partner School 
in the Learning Partners Program. Upon graduation at the end of the 2016-2017 school year, we received a Learning 
Partners Continuation Grant. We used this grant to partner with the co-located schools in our building for after school 
professional development including a book study of Mindset. Participants in this professional development series 
reflected on ways to promote growth mindset around the school community. During the 2017-2018 school year, 
P168X will have three teachers participate in the Model Teacher program. These teachers will support the school 
community in improving instructional practices aligned to Danielson, creating a school culture emphasizing growth 
mindset, and increasing collaboration with related services in the classroom to provide students with continuous, high 
quality supports throughout the school day. 

Starting with the 2015-2016 school year, we partnered with Arts Connection through a large grant received from CVS. 
This partnership with Arts Connection continued into the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years, expanding to 
multiple sites. This collaboration has led to students expressing themselves through the arts and increasing their 
socialization skills. 

In the past, P168X has focused on a school-wide PBIS program called "SOAR" to promote a Supportive Environment. 
During the 2017-2018 school year, we used a Case Study to identify students to prepare them for a Less Restrictive 
Environment (LRE) or Less Intensive Services (LIS). Once per month, teams of teachers and related service providers 
met and used protocols to identify the gaps in student learning and design supports to use throughout the school day. 
This resulted in an increase of the number of students transitioning to community schools and receiving fewer related 
services. Our area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to continue this trend by increasing the collaboration 
between classroom teachers and related services providers to ensure that students are moving toward their Least 
Restrictive Environment.  

During the 2017-2018 school year in the Framework element of Strong Family-Community Ties, we worked to 
increase parental involvement with a partnership with the Office of School Health's Mental Health Consulting 
program. This resulted in an increase in families' awareness of outside services to support students and families. 
During the 2018-2019 school year, we are focusing on increasing family involvement by inviting families into 
classrooms six times a year to celebrate the successes of students. Families will have the opportunity to see what 
students are working on in their classroom and become true partners in their child's education. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P168X is comprised of 6:1+1, 8:1+1, and 12:1+1 classes for students in grades K-8, 8:1+2 classes for Pre-K students, 
and 9:1+3 classes for high school inclusion students. 100% of our students have IEPs. Our student population is 
diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Emotional Behavioral Disorders, Other Health Impairments, Intellectual 
Disabilities, and Speech and Language Disorders. In addition to having a disability diagnosis, 23% of our students are 
also English Language Learners who receive ENL services or are in bilingual classes.  

In order to support students' specific needs, students receive targeted instruction to meet the specified learning 
styles and needs outlined in the Individualized Education Program. Students also receive related services to support 
their growth as specified on their IEP, which include but are not limited to Speech & Language Therapy, Occupational 
Therapy, Physical Therapy, Counseling, Hearing Services, Adaptive Physical Education, Health Paraprofessional 
Services, Crisis Paraprofessional Services, Special Transportation Services, Communication Devices (AAC Devices), and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Transition Planning Services. Parents and guardians receive Parent Counseling and Training as specified by a student's 
IEP.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, P168X had the most success in the Framework Element of Rigorous Instruction. 
Our goal for teachers to use explicit instruction strategies to implement guided reading four days per week for 45 
minutes each day, resulting in an increase in Fountas and Pinnell levels for 90% of the identified 8:1+1 and 12:1+1 
students. We met this goal by providing students in these classes targeted instruction to raise their reading levels and 
providing teachers with targeted feedback around their teaching practices during guided reading by the principal, 
assistant principals, and a guided reading coach. 

For the upcoming school year our focus area will continue to be Rigorous Instruction. We will build off of the success 
of the Case Study, by having teachers and related service providers collaborate to incorporate Questioning and 
Discussion techniques into instruction to ensure generalization of communication skills. The result being in an 
increase in the number of students meeting their IEP goals as well as increased student comprehension skills. 

P168X's Theory of Action 

If administrators and teacher leaders establish and communicate clear expectations around questioning and 
discussion practices and provide consistent, timely, and actionable feedback around those expectations, then there 
will be an increase in consistency and coherence around questioning and discussion practices amongst the sites in the 
organization and student achievement will increase. 

Instructional Focus  

At P 168X we will ensure every students' voice is heard.  

  Teachers will design lessons with a variety of cognitively challenging questions and plan for student 

discussions. 

  Paraprofessionals will facilitate small group discussion everyday 
  Administrators will provide staff with actionable feedback on questioning and discussion practices 
  Related Service providers will collaborate with teachers to develop student communication skills and improve 

 

 

mastery of learning goals. 
Instructional Coaches will develop teachers to use new innovative techniques to incorporate discussion and 
increase comprehension skills 
IEP Coaches will help develop Present Levels of Performance that make it clear students preferred mode of 
communication and coach teachers to create goals appropriate to increase communication and

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 75X168, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

75X168 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

75X168, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

We are continuing our program in the Spring term, in order to avoid cancellations or 
transportation difficulties for participants due to inclement weather, the dates of the program will 
be late April 2019 through June 2019. At P.168X we currently have 130 ELLs, 117 students are 
alternate assessment and 13 students are in standardized assessment classes. 107 of our English 
Language Learners have a native language of Spanish, five with a home language of Bengali, 
three with a home language of Soninke, two with home languages of Arabic and Fulani and one 
students with a home language of each of the following languages: Cantonese, Hausa, Mandingo, 
Telegu, Ukrainian and Urdu.  Of the 117 students in alternate assessment, 78 are in 12:1:1 
classes, 24 students are in 6:1:1 AU classes and 15 in 8:1:1. Of the 13 students in standardized 
assessment 1 student is in an 8:1:1 class, 9 students are in 12:1:1 ED classes, program and 3 
students in a 9:1:3 inclusion program.  Title III funds will be used to fund a “Saturday Learning 
Academy” for 18 ELL students with disabilities and their parents. ELLs in the Saturday Learning 
Academy will be instructed in one 12:1:1 class and one 6:1:1 class. We invite these students 
based on their performance on the 2018 NYSESLAT - all students are at the beginner/Entering 
level. We will have parents participate in the entire program because research has proven that 
family involvement correlates with higher academic performance and school improvement as 
articulated in the NEA's policy brief "Parent, Family, Community Involvement in 
Education".  This parent involvement is even more critical for students with disabilities and in 
minority communities (School-Family-Community Collaboration for African American Males 
with Disabilities; Journal of African American Males in Education, Spring 2016).  The student 
and parent program will be linked to ensure the greatest success for all those involved. The 
program will be held on seven consecutive Saturdays excluding holidays and will run for the first 
six weeks from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM; the trip to Bear Mountain on one Saturday will run from 
9:30 AM to 2:30 PM. We will spend the four hours on the weekly trips with the parents and the 
students.  The culminating project will be held in conjunction with a Family Activity Fair at our 
main site and will also last 4 hours. The program will focus on strengthening performance in 
core academic subject areas including English Language Arts, Science and Social Studies. The 
Title III instructional program will begin in April 2019, ending in June 2019 and will consist of a 
series of trips through the New York metro area with a culminating collaborative project. This 
project will be a photo book that will highlight each family's experience during the program. 
Throughout the Saturday Learning Academy, parents will work alongside their children on 
specialized activities that will afford parents an opportunity to help their youngsters build their 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in English in content areas in the field.   Parents 
and students will use the cameras to record the experience of each trip and create a photo journal 
with details about each site and their personal experiences there, and a MacBook Air to use for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
editing of the photo journals as well as for follow up instruction.  The seventh and last Saturday 
of the Learning Academy will be focused on allowing the parent and their child to create a photo 
book using Shutterfly.com.  Parents and students will work together to generate text based on the 
experiences.  Funds will also be used to purchase CD players to listen to texts to preview the 
destinations we will be visiting. We will explore the history, the cultures and the natural 
environment of New York City to incorporate science and social studies into the ENL 
curriculum.  Visits will consist of trips to the American Museum of Natural History, Bear 
Mountain, NY Aquarium, NY Botanical Gardens, and the Bronx Zoo. School will provide buses 
for three trips and the subway will be used for three trips. During each 4 hour session of the 
academy, students will receive direct instruction to support their language needs through content 
area studies. The program and instruction will be aligned to New York State Bilingual 
Progressions, which concentrate on building and developing social and academic language and 
align with Common Core Learning standards. Once we determine the actual students who elect 
to participate in our program, we will incorporate the Common Core Learning Standards for the 
appropriate grades for English Language Arts, Science and Social Studies. Our ELLs have 
deficiencies in all aspects of language and each session will promote holistic language learning 
in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The program will employ two certified 
ENL/Bilingual teachers and three paraprofessionals. One of the teachers is currently working as 
a coach and the other as a guidance counselor but both have ENL/Bilingual licenses. Three 
paraprofessionals will be part of the Title III program. Three are needed because one student who 
is anticipated to attend requires a one to one paraprofessional. The ENL/Bilingual teacher will 
appropriately differentiate instruction based on each student’s IEP. Since our Title III 
supplemental instructional program will take place on Saturday, an administrator is needed and 
will be present to ensure that all compliance and instructional requirements are being met. The 
administrator will accompany the participants and staff on the trips.  We are inviting ELLs with a 
ratio of 12:1:1 from grades 3-5 and ELLs with a ratio of 6:1:1 grades 6-8 to attend the “Saturday 
Learning Academy”.  The language of instruction for the program will be in English and will be 
supplemented with a Spanish-language paraprofessionals who will be able to offer native 
language written translation and/or oral interpretation to those students and parents that require 
it. ELLs that participate in the program will be continuously assessed by the teachers throughout 
the entire Saturday program, using teacher-made assessments, observation, and student 
portfolios. This year we plan on purchasing a Mac Book Air, 2 iPad Minis, picture books for 
instruction to assist parents in generating language with children, paper and laminating supplies, 
ink or printing materials, metro cards for children and parents as well as admission tickets for 
places we will visit. Instruction will be provided during the trip with focus on how parents can 
support their children's learning and lesson plans kept in a binder.

  We will use Title III funds to pay for professional development (study group) on 5 Saturdays 
for the assistant principal, two teachers and the paraprofessionals working the Saturday 
Academy. The PD study groups will meet for 1 hour prior to the start of the first five sessions of 
the “Saturday Learning Academy” from 8:30-9:30. The dates of the study group are concurrent

Part C: Professional Development  
with the Saturday program.  According to Angrist & Lavy in "Does Teacher Training Affect 
Pupil Learning" published in the Journal of Labor Economics (2001), ongoing professional 
development has a positive correlation with student achievement.  The rationale for the study 
group is for the Title III educators to work collaboratively to understand how new immigrant 
populations in our school view disabilities so we can better work with these families in the 
educational process.  We will focus on communities from Africa and Bangladesh in order to 
develop strategies and techniques to empower families to work successfully with their children’s 
disabilities.  The goal will be that these strategies can be expanded to the entire ELL population 
at P168X. Each member of the study group will be provided with a copy of each section and will 
be responsible for reading them prior to the next session. Articles to be read include "Disability 
Within the African Culture" published by the University of Nigeria, "Cultural Beliefs and 
Attitudes About Disabilities in East Africa" by Angi Stone-MacDonald, and "Education for 
Disabled Children in Bangladesh: Perceptions, Misconceptions and Challenges" by Prof. Neaz 
Ahmed and Abul Kashem.  Each participant will be assigned a section of the reading, using the 
jigsaw method. They will be responsible to presenting the content of their section to the other 
participants and will include suggestions for practical implications for the classroom and for 
family engagement based on the research.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  ERIC Digest’s article on “Parent Involvement and The Education of Limited English Proficient 
Students” (2009) recognizes the growing body of research that illustrates the importance of 
parent involvement and of giving parents concrete skills to support their children’s learning at 
home. The article cites studies demonstrating that parent involvement leads to greater academic 
gains in ELLs. Learning to Learn in a Second Language by Pauline Gibbons states that schools 
that are supportive of ELLs will incorporate parent involvement and incorporate language 
learning in all areas of the curriculum. The parent component will have a dual focus; the first will 
be to help parents to develop an understanding of grade level expectations in core content areas 
and give them examples of ways to enrich their children’s learning in these respective content 
areas. The second piece will be exposing parents to city wide resources for enhancing their 
children’s educational and social experiences by working in collaboration with various museums 
and cultural institutions across the NY Metro Area. Both aspects of the program will prepare 
parents to help their children in the acquisition of the English language. Throughout the Saturday 
Learning Academy, parents will work alongside their children on specialized activities that will 
afford parents an opportunity to help their youngsters build their listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing skills in English in content areas in the field.  Parents will use digital media to record the 
experience of each trip and create a photo journal with details about each site and their personal 
experiences there.  The final Saturday of the program will be dedicated to each parent working 
with their child to plan, design and produce their individual photo book.  Parents and students 
will work together to generate text based on the experiences in order to enrich classroom 
learning, and foster curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. The program is designed to engage 
students of diverse backgrounds, interests and abilities while fulfilling Common Core Learning

Standards.  As an incentive for parent involvement we will give a raffle ticket for each week of 
attendance. At the culmination of the program we will raffle off a $100 gift card  so that parents 
can purchase educational materials to be used with their children. We will continue the raffle we 
started in previous years because it has served to increase interest in the Saturday Academy. In 
order to notify the parents of ELLs, of the Title III program and of CR Part 154 services for 
ELLs during the school day, we will conduct a parent orientation in collaboration with the parent 
coordinator during parent teacher conferences. In addition, we will also be sending a Title III 
letter in English, Spanish, Chinese and Bengali to inform them of the Saturday Academy 
program with the dates and places we will be visiting. Our bilingual parent coordinator will do 
outreach for our program by contacting parents and will attend trips with us. We will have 
various staff members available to provide oral interpretation and written translation services to 
any parents who may require them and who will provide follow up phone calls to the families to 
inform them about the program, as well as the Office of Translation and Interpretation Services.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, our school uses Fountas and Pinnell, Scantron Performance Series, SANDI and 
SANDI FAST. This data helps our staff determine the reading level of our students and allows us to provide targeted instruction 
in the students' class and during direct ESL instruction. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers test their own students with assistance from coaches at each site.  Data is shared with all teachers who work with 
each students.  ENL teachers assesses reading level of bilingual students with Fountas and Pinnell.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate our programs's success by reviewing data including scores from NYSAA, NYSESLAT, and IEP goals for each student. 
Our ESL teachers meet with classroom teachers, service providers and parents to review students' successes and plan next 
steps for each student.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

At each site, teachers work in teams to design their own curriculum map to meet students at their performance level. ENL 
teachers with with classroom teachers to design collaborative lessons to best help ELLs with the curriculum at their level.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our  ESL Department provides professional development to staff of Language Acquisition in content areas and cultural 
background of students.  NYSITELL data is used to assess the language proficiency of new ELLs. and the Spanish LAB data is 
used to identify the dominant language of the child. Tier 1 instruction is implemented by creating appropriate small group 
instruction, scaffolding language, and providing opportunities for vocabulary development across domains each day. Tier 2 
instruction is used for standardized assessment students and alternate assessment students with emerging literacy skills one 
instructional period daily utilizing a variety of methodologies for promoting literacy and vocabulary skills.  Our Bilingual and 
ESL teachers use Tier 3 instruction by providing reading interventions for ELLs that are tailored for each student.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data reveals that our students perform better in the Listening/Speaking portions of the test, and lower in the 
Reading/Writing portions.  ENL instruction for these students will focus on content area literacy skills, grade level reading and 
writing in the content areas and the ESL staff will co teach with content area teachers to bring students to grade proficiency 
level.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Our Instructional Team reviews school wide data.  In Common planning meetings, teachers look at trends in students' 
performance and share strategies for moving students to the next level. ENL teachers distribute NYSESLAT scores to classroom 
teachers and work closely with them throughout the year to make progress in each of the four modalities for all students.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The majority of our students are at the Entering, or beginner level. They are grouped in three contiguous grades and 
receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Students can be in heterogenous groups, 
the size of which is based on their IEP mandates. The ESL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom teacher for 
180 minutes of instruction per week. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

TBE students receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL in the classroom and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Grades K-6 
receives standalone ENL from their classroom teacher.  Grade 7 and up receives standalone by the ESL Teacher. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

Our school does not have a dual language program. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Those students in standardized and alternate assessment receive the mandated number of minutes of ESL instruction 
per week as outlined by CR-154. The majority of our ESL students in grades K to 8 perform at an entering or emerging 
proficiency level and thus receive 360 minutes of instruction; 180 minutes of direct ESL instruction and 180 minutes coteaching 
in content areas with subject area teacher and ESL teacher. Our Expanding ESL students in grades K-8 receive 180 minutes of 
direct ESL instruction/content area instruction.. For our high school students, the entering level ESL students receive 540 
minutes of ESL, in a combination of Stand-alone ESL And Integrated ESL as mandated by CR Part 154-2, the emerging level ESL 
students receive 360 minutes of ESL, and the transitioning/expanding/commanding  levels of ESL students receive 180 minutes 
of ESL and 180 minutes of ELA instruction.  Our two ESL teachers travel between sites to ensure that all ELLs receive service. 
The ESL teacher provides direct instruction for ESL for all students in our bilingual classes in grades 7 and 8.  HLA is provided by 
the Bilingual teachers 180 minutes a week. At P168x, all of our HLA instruction is Spanish.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Our ESL teachers coteach with the classroom teachers, who have all been trained in ESL methodologies, to teach content 
areas such as ELA, math, science and social studies.  Our school is divided into seven different sites. The ESL staff ensures that 
all students receive the mandated number of minutes as per CR Part 154 by creating schedules that divide students into 
heterogeneous groups at each site. Our bilingual program consists of four transitional bilingual classes at the elementary and 
middle school level taught by certified teachers, with the ESL teacher teaching ESL for students grades 7-8.  All four are 
alternate assessment classes.  Our teachers follow the New York State ESL Standards.  The teachers use balanced literacy 
strategies in the student’s native language, as well as in English to teach their students. All the students in the bilingual class 
are beginner and intermediate level students and thus receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction and 180 minutes of NLA 
instruction.  All NLA instruction in our school is conducted in Spanish.  Our school has a program wide curriculum based on the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Our ESL teachers connect their instruction to this curriculum in order to meet the demands 
of Common Core Learning Standards.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   To ensure that Spanish speaking ELLs are evaluated apropriately in their native language, upon enrollment they are 
administered the Spanish LAB.  When appropriate students who are native language dominant are administered standardized 
assessments in their native language. Our Bilingual teachers use teacher created assessments in the native language (Spanish) 
during each unit of study for NLA to assess student knowledge on the topic and their native language abilities. informal 
assessements including checklists, oral assessments and worksheets are conducted daily during native language instruction in 
our Transitional Bilingual Education classes.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our program differentiates instruction for ELL sub-groups by grouping students based on proficiency level, IEP mandates 
and/or individual needs. To ease the transition into the classroom for SIFEs the ESL teachers work closely with the classroom 
teacher and with service providers to develop adapted expectations, provide intensive supports to bridge deficits and work 
collaboratively to address their specific needs. For our newcomer students we will provide supplemental instruction to ensure 
a smooth transition into the new school system. Our newcomers will be grouped together to provide instruction based upon 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

their unique needs. Instruction will focus on vocabulary development, literacy and fluency in English and the native 
language.  They will also be invited to attend our Title III Saturday Academy and will be provided with AIS services where 
possible.  Due to the nature of the severe disabilities of our students, many require extended time to achieve proficiency in 
English. The ESL staff works collaboratively with the instructional team to help develop a need - specific program of 
instruction. Our long term ELLs will continue to receive their mandated ESL services, which are determined by their English 
language proficiency level and their IEP recommendations. The long term ELLs will be invited to attend the Saturday Academy 
to help with their transition out of ESL. Service termination or continuation for these students will be evaluated at their CSE 
review, triennial review, or EPC.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All of our ELLs are identified as having special needs.  Our entire program is created for their needs as described above. We use 
matierials that are age and grade level appropriate. Our ELL teachers use a variety of materials including Ipads, communication 
devices, manipulatives and visuals to make the content accessible and to afford opportunites for expressive  language 
development to non verbal  English Language learners.  Classroom teachers and related service providers use PECS (Picture 
Exchange Communication System) to increase receptive and expressive language in students with limited verbal skills. We use 
Total Physical Response and the Language Experience Method based off of class activities and community trips to increase 
language comprehension and output for students with disabilities.      
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school is entirely composed of SWD and provides students with a range of programs and services to enable them to reach 
their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  We offer a continuium of services for 
SWD ranging from a ratio of 6:1:1 to inclusion programs within general education settings. The curriculum is based on common 
core standards and is differentiated according to the students' abilities. We offer two inclusion programs, one at Clinton High 
School and one at East Bronx Academy serving grades 9-12.  These two programs offer an opportunity for our middle school 
and high school ELLs to attend the least restrictive environment and maximize time spent with non-disabled peers.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our school has after school, Saturday academy, and the Chapter 683 program as targeted intervention for all ELLs. Saturday 
Academy focuses on Math, ELA, Social Studies and Science exclusively for English Language Learners.  Our MIddle School 
Afterschool Program, focuses on Writing skills and math skills for middle school students. Chapter 683 is open to all our ELLs 
and offers summer school for extra support in  ELA, Math, Social Studies and Science.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

As mandated by CR-154, ESL teachers will co teach with content area teachers in classrooms with ELLs.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We will continue current programs for ELLs.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are invited to attend our Title III Saturday Academy and will be provided with AIS services where possible.  We invite 
families to attend our Saturday Academy via letter home in the families native langauges and personal phone calls from the 
ESL teachers. Our program is a 12 month program and all of our students are encouraged to attend the Chapter 683 program 
in the summer to maintain academic progress. As with every program, letters are sent home in English and in the parents' 
home language. The majority of our ELLs attend our summer program.  Our after school program invites all middle school ELLs 
from our main site using the same protocal and ELLs participate in this program.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our ESL teachers use The Reading Rabbit program with their students to help develop reading language skills. For our non-
verbal students we use Ipads in class instruction and some students use communication devices that are personal to specific 
students such as Accent, GOTALK32, or Proloquo260. Our ESL and bilingual teachers have Ipads and most classrooms have 
smartboards to be used as instructional tools in the development of language proficiency.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The ELLs in the TBE program are provided with native language instruction in the content areas of math, science and social 
studies. This Home Language Arts instruction in Spanish is provided for a minimum of 180 minutes weekly. For ELLs who are 
mandated for bilingual services and placed in a monolingual classroom they are assigned an alternate placement 
paraprofessional. The alternate placement paraprofessional provides native language support and translation services to 
ensure that the student is able to access instruction.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Our ESL teachers work closely with classroom teachers to align instruction with grade level expectations in curriculum. 
Required support services and resources are designed to correspond to the individual needs of our students as designated in 
their IEPs. All resources and supports are adapted for students with disabilities to correspond to their cognitive needs, while 
remaining age and grade appropriate.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We share cafeteria, outdoor recreational areas and libraries with schools we are collocated with.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 Newcomers are invited to participate in the Chapter 683 program to help their transition into the school.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 Spanish classes are offered as a language elective to all middle school students.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our school does not currently offer a dual languge program.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
For Bilingual Education and ESL teachers, 50% of the professional development hours will be specific to the needs of Ells, co-
teaching strategies and integrating language content and instruction.  We will utilize district professional development 
opportunities and turn keying information to our colleagues. Our Title III program includes a professional development 
component for staff that focuses on Language Acquisition in the content areas. We will have school professional development

and team meetings every Friday afternoon as students will be released for a half day.  
Teachers of ELLs are offered professional development to support ELLs in house as well as at the district level. Our ESL teachers 
implement the strategies learned regarding the Common Core Learning Standards as they teach collaboratively with the 
content area teachers, as well as turnkey information to staff.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school offers K-12 programs.  Many of our students remain with us from elementary to middle school, allowing us to offer 
continuous academic support.  Our Counselors conduct Level 1 Assessments with students, teachers and parents to assist our 
middle school students who are transitioning to another program.     
Our ESL teachers Annette Linen and Stacey O'Neil will attend  2 Friday afternoon sessions monthly with classroom teachers for 
professional development. Topics will include best practices for co-teaching strategies, integrating language and content 
instruction for English Language Learners and language acquisition in alignment with content instruction. Records, including 
topics and signature pages, will be kept at each site in the ELL Compliance binder.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Starting this academic year all ELL teachers will reach out to parents and hold individual face to face meetings to discuss their 
language development progress at six times throughout  the year. This meeting will discuss the results of langauge proficiency 
assessments, language development in content areas and the goals of the child's program (TBE or ESL). An interpretor will be 
available for these meetings; Stacey O'Neil will serve as the interpretor for Spanish Speaking parents.  
ANSWER FOR 2 BELOW:  Records for the annual individual meetings with ELL Parents will be kept by  all  ESL and Bilingual 
teachers and in student  file in main office at each site. These records will include date and signature page as well as any follow 
steps necessary.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
 Our Title III is used to run a Saturday Academy for both ELLs and their parents.  Parents are shown ways to improve language 
development in their children in the classroom and in the community during the Saturday Academy sessions. We have monthly 
parent meetings with the bilingual parent coordinator who personally contacts ELL parents to encourage attendance. Parents 
who require an interpretor are provided one over the phone from the Office of Translation and Interpretation Services, when 
the language required is provided. We also run an annual Health and Resource Fair on a Saturday for all families.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maureen Fullerton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To determine the language preferences of our parent community, we rely on the ENL teachers to survey the 
Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) as the first step. Teachers at our school have frequent contact with 
families due to the nature of our students' disabilities and therefore teachers and classroom para professionals 
are aware of the parents' preferred languages and utilize in house bilingual staff for the needs of our Spanish 
speaking staff.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We use School Messenger with translations in Spanish. Staff use the Language Line to reach families who speak 
languages for which we have no bilingual staff. All teachers have parent contact information and can contact using 
bilingual staff or the Language Line if there is a student - specific emergency. School nurses have access to the 
Language Line or bilingual staff as necessary.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff are given training in Staff Development Days. The ENL teacher provides trainings and is a resource to help staff 
be aware of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

          Upon entrance to each buildings we have signage informing parents of their rights to an interpreter. Parent 
Coordinator and ESL teacher lead meetings with parents twice a year and inform them of their rights as parents, 
including rights to translation and interpretation.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Due to the nature of our students' disabilities and the low teacher-student ratio, we have frequent communication 
between home and school. Parents can express their feedback on quality of services informally during face to face 
meetings or phone calls and formally on the annual parent survey. We have met to specifically address the needs of 
the women of the Bengali community to ensure outside interpretation at all meetings, even when a male family 
member is present who may be fluent in English to ensure representation for mothers.
