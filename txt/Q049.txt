Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The school’s mission is to create an environment which enhances students’ natural curiosity; fosters a desire for 
lifelong learning; and encourages students to use their diverse talents to bring positive change to their community. 
To this end, we offer a liberal arts program that challenges students to think critically and take ownership of their 
own learning that is enhanced by technology, music, drama and visual arts. Our program strives to provide a 
dynamic environment and quality education which prepares students for the rigors of high school, college and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

careers. Students are afforded the opportunity to pursue their interests after school through a robust offering of 
extracurricular activities.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS/IS 49 is a K-8 school located in the heart of the vibrant community of Middle Village, Queens. It serves 1,181 
students from grade kindergarten through grade 8. The school population comprises 1% Black, 27% Hispanic, 56% 
White, and 16% Asian students. The student body includes 6 % English language learners and 10% special education 
students. Boys account for 52% of the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. The average attendance rate for 
the 2105-2016 school year was 95.81%. 

Through partnerships with Studio In a School, the New York Historical Society and The Museum of the City of New 
York, students are exposed to a variety of experiences at cultural institutions throughout New York City that 
support the curriculum. Last year feedback following the Principal Performance Observation indicated a need for 
stronger systems for progress monitoring. To that end, administration and staff will focus on continuing to improve 
these systems with an emphasis on students with disabilities. Additionally, feedback from parents, staff, and 
students indicates a desire for continued emphasis on authentic tasks that connect students to world around them. 
As a result, school staff will continue to look for and take advantage of opportunities for students to engage in 
authentic tasks . The school community will continue to work to maintain a Supportive Environment to meet the 
needs of all students with emphasis on English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Through 
collaboration with our student government and PTA, administration will focus on improving parental involvement 
as it relates to the element of Strong Family-Community Ties.   

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school's special education and ENL populations continue to grow and each population is in need of strong 
academic supports with particular emphasis on literacy and math and language acquisition for ENL students. 
Additionally each population has unique needs related to social-emotional development. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

School quality guide indicates performance in all categories exceeds district and city averages with particularly strong 
rating for collaborative teachers and effective school leadership. Data indicates need for increased focus on improving 
supports in place for all students to better meet social emotional needs.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

 

 

State Assesment data indicates that ELA and math scores for all students have improved 10% and 6% 
respectively over last three years 

  NYSED Roadmap and implementation timeline for Next Generation Learning Standards indicates need for 

professional development on Standards leading to full implementation by September of 2020. 

  Written feedback from Principal Performance Review indicates strong collaborative culture among teachers 

 

as it relates to making curricular adjustments based on student data. 
Successful implementation of Professional Learning Communities over the last two years has created a culture 
in which teachers have developed the capacity for autonomous collaborative unit planning. 

  Parent feedback at school leadership team meetings indicates a desire to ensure Next Generation Standards 

are implemented in accordance with NYSED Roadmap. 

  Written feedback following PPO visits indicates continued emphasis on using observation cycle to provide 
effective instructional next steps to teachers leading to active engagement and high level thinking across 
classrooms. 

  2017-2018 School Quality Guide indicates that while Rigorous Instruction exceeds both district and city 

averages it is the Framework Measure that exceeds district average by the smallest margin indicating a need 
for continued focus on rigorous instruction. 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S./I.S. 49, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S./I.S. 49 will support parents and families by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities.  

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

Parent representatives from SLT and PTA were consulted in the creation of this Policy. 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding issues surrounding parental involvement 

● ensure that funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described 
in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association)  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office. Parent coordinator will make a concerted effort to engage non-
English speaking parents. 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● hosting educational family activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association)

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
   PS/ IS 49, a K – 8 school implements a free standing ENL program in accordance with CR Part 
154 and Title III guidelines for approximately 45 students.  All students are provided with 
programs that will enable them to meet the NYS Performance Standards and the Common Core 
Standards.  Our school vision includes developing a program that focuses on literacy, math and 
technology supported by the cultural arts.  Our staff members are introduced to quality 
professional development that helps them align their lessons in accordance with our educational 
philosophy.  
  
Our Title III program will provide English Language Learners with supplemental instruction in 
different  School Instructional Programs on several levels according to NYSESLAT, Periodic 
Assessments and NYS exams.  Our ENL student population is a diverse group who speak a 
variety of languages, some of which include Russian, Uzbek, Spanish, Chinese, Polish and 
Hungarian. Upon examining the NYSESLAT scores (2016 & 2017),  ELL Data Analysis Tool 
(EDAT), state assessments, benchmark assessments as well as running records, we determined 
that our ELL students needed supplementary instruction in literacy and math in grades K-8.   
  
In order to maximize success, materials will be purchased to maximize student performance 
(word to word bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, content area dictionaries, picture dictionaries, 
books on tapes/cds and native language books, NYSESLAT test materials). This year we will 
also use Lexia, an on line reading program to support reading comprehension and provide 
individualized instruction. Weekly reports will provide teachers with data in order to plan small 
group lessons. The program also provides direct adaptive instruction in phonemic awareness, 
systematic phonics instruction and methods to improve fluency. For the math portion of our 
supplemental Title III program we will use Castle Learning, which the school has purchased with 
other funds. Castle Learning also provides teachers with weekly data reports which will help 
target students' needs. 
  
Our ELL students in grades K-8 will participate in: 
* Saturday Academy: 9:00-12:00 October 20, 2018 to March 23, 2019 ,exclusive of Holiday 
weekends: 16 sessions. The Saturday program will be managed by 2 ENL certified teachers 
and 2 CB teachers for the cost of 16- 3 hour sessions that  will be charged to Title III.  Both CB 
teachers are trained in ENL methodologies. In order to provide English language development 
support students are provided with interactive picture word walls, bilingual dictionaries and 
glossaries.

Begin description here:            
   In order to support the instructional programs, the ENL teacher will continue to participate in 
various professional development opportunities provided by the Division of Students with 
Disabilities & English Language Learners, NYCDOE. For instance, this school year our ENL 
teachers participated in the following workshops: Determining the Annual Measurable 
Achievement Objectives, Socratic Seminar of ENL students, monthly workshops entitled, " 
English as a New Language: Helping ELLs Integrate into Our Schools" offered by Queens North 
Field Support Center. 
  
 In addition, we will provide three professional learning sessions that will be tailored to support 
the four Title III service providers in implementing the Title III program activities described in 
the narrative. 
  
 Rationale: To ensure teachers are receiving receiving support to provide a successful Title III 
program, as well as classroom teachers that work with ELLs, there will be opportunities to attend 
professional development.  The DELLSS- "News and Opportunities for Educators" will be a 
resource we can use to provide training to staff. 
2.  Teachers to receive training:  Title III service providers. 
 3.  Schedule and Duration:  Teachers, who work with ELLs  in Title III program/ Teacher 
of  parents of ELLS, will be invited to discuss ESL strategies and methods and implementation 
of these in their teaching.   Three PD meetings will take place for 50 minutes before Saturday 
school and will start on November 3, 2018 (three sessions) .   
  
4.  Topics to be covered:    
-Scaffolding:  We will be addressing how to scaffold tasks so ELLs can be provided with support 
while engaging rigorous tasks.  Scaffolds for ELLs should support them academically and 
linguistically.  We will use Engage NY's Scaffolding Instruction of English Language Learners: 
Resource Guides for English Language Arts and Mathematics, Kaylene Beers:" When Kids Can't 
Read", and "Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning: Teaching Second Language Learners 
in the Mainstream Classroom" by Pauline Gibbons. In addition, The Teaching Channel Core 
Videos for ELLs will be used to model lessons for ELLs. 
-Bolstering Advanced Literacy Skills for English Language Learners:  Professional Development 
given by DELLSS.  To ensure these professional learning sessions are having a direct impact on 
the students, the Assistant Principal will meet weekly with the Title III teachers  to discuss 
progress and visit classes.

Begin description here:            
 
 
  
Due to the fact that our ELL population is growing,  we offer several workshops which will 
introduce parents to the educational program and provide them with strategies that they can 
incorporate to support the acquisition of English.   Parent workshops will be conducted and 
facilitated by the assistant  principals,  literacy coach and parent coordinator.  Most workshops 
will last one hour and are held throughout the school year. Topics to be covered as as follows:  
*Parents will become familiar with our school's website and many resources on the 
website. (November 2018)  
*Parents will become familiar with the New Language Progressions and NYSESLAT 
assessment. (March 2019) 
* Parents will become familiar with Lexia and Castle Learning. Parents will be given specific 
strategies and tips to support their children at home.  (December 2018) 
In order to ensure that all participating parents /families of ELLs benefit from these workshops 
we will provide parent volunteer translators. The parents will be notified through translated 
notices that will be backpacked to the parents and they will be posted on the school's website. 
24Q049 will use other funding sources to complement all additional costs.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  -When assessing early literacy skills we are analyzing the following skills:   
•     Print Awareness –understanding print is left to right, top to bottom, letters/words 
•     Phonological Awareness- Being able to hear the small sounds in words helps children sound out words they see and learn 
to speak new words. 
•     Letter Knowledge -Knowing the names and sounds of letters helps children sound out words they see. 
•     Vocabulary-Knowing many different words helps children understand what they hear and read. 
•     Narrative Skills -Learning to tell a story helps children develop thinking and comprehension skills. 
-We use several assessment tools to gather data about students’ early literacy skills. 
1.  TCRWP- A running record can provide information about a student’s print awareness, phonological awareness,  vocabulary 
and narrative skills. 
2.  NYSITELL Levels I and II: Level I for can provide information about print awareness and narrative skills.  Level II can provide 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

information about print awareness, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and narrative skills. 
3.  Words Their Way spelling inventory assessment is administered by the ENL teacher and based on the results of the 
assessment, students are placed in different ability groups (grades 3-8). Early literacy skills of ELL students in grades K-2 are 
also assessed with the Fundations Word Study Program. 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

After administering these  formative  assessments students receive assessment-based feedback ( rubrics, checklists, oral 
feedback).  The purpose of the feedback is to help teachers support  students  in increasing their achievement. Benchmark 
assessments  provide  information about the progress towards a set of expectations. Teachers use these assessment to drive 
their instruction. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At this moment we are using ENL Benchmarks administered three times a year in grades K-8. Each ENL Benchmark is designed 
for a specific grade band that corresponds to the NYSESLAT grade band. For instance, we have ENL benchmark for grades: K, 1-
2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8. ENL Benchmark mirrors the NYSESLAT 3 modalities: Listening, Reading and Writing. We also included 
Understanding and Using Content Vocabulary Section that assesses ELLs academic language and relates closely to the Speaking 
part of the NYSESLAT. ENL Benchmark provides us valuable information on ELL students' baseline proficiency levels and gives a 
very specific item analysis of each question. It also helps us develop units/ lessons and targeted interventions/ and or 
differentiations throughout the school year. Moreover, ENL Benchmark enables us to track ELL students' progress throughout 
the school year and helps us address students weaknesses and build  upon their strengths. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered we conduct item analysis for multiple choice questions and  use rubrics for open 
ended questions. Thereafter, we focus on the areas students struggle with and we design units/lessons, targeted 
interventions/ and or interventions through the school year. ENL Benchmarks help us keep track of ELL students' progress. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
-Implementing the RtI framework for ELLs begins with gathering data about a student’s knowledge and literacy skills in 
L1.  During the initial interview with the student and parent, we inquire about the child’s prior school experience: Was 
instruction in L1 or L2?  What are the student’s strengths and weaknesses-ELA, Math, Science? If the child is beginning school 
for the first time in the United States, we request a report card from the native country. In addition, we can gather data about 
a student’s L1 in Spanish by using the Spanish  LAB. 
Identifying students’ L1 ability can help us determine the supports a student may need as well as students who may be at risk. 
-Tier I for ELLs consists of : 
•     promoting vocabulary and language development by providing ongoing and appropriate instruction in academic language 
use in the native language and/or in English.  
•     Scaffold language for students to respond by providing sentence stems and provide opportunities for appropriate peer 
learning, including peer pairing and small-group instruction. 
-Tier 2 for ELLs consist of: 
•     Provide intensive reading interventions to ELLs demonstrating low reading skills when needed in small groups.  Students 
are provided with support using the Fundations program to increase reading skills.  In addition, students who need Tier 2 
support are invited to after school and Saturday  programs to develop reading skills.  
-     During the school year, student progress is monitored in various ways:  TC Running Records, Teacher Created baseline and 
benchmark  assessments and PBA data (Teachers College). 
- For students who scored below the accepted benchmark, a second stage begins with strong core instruction (Tier1) with 
monitoring to confirm how at risk students are responding to instruction.  Teachers who feel ELLs are not performing at grade 
level standards are referred to the PPT team.  Members review the teacher's data and then there are decisions made about 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

next steps. All students who are referred and reviewed by the PPT team, have  follow up observations  made by team 
members and data is reviewed to determine if the current interventions are beneficial for the student. 
  
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and grades reveal varying results. At the moment 
we have 13 entering ELLs in grades K-8:   3 in kindergarten, 4 in first grade, 1 in second, 1 in fifth grade,  1 in sixth grade, 1 in 
seventh grade, and 2 eighth grade. We have 17 emerging and transitioning ELLs, 33 expanding ELLs and 21 commanding ELLS. 
The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT reveal that some of our  entering, emerging, and 
transitioning ELL students have strong speaking and listening skills but they are weak in reading and writing, and yet others 
need to improve in all four modalities. 
 
The EDAT provides us with the information about at-risk ELLs ( levels 1-6).  For example, we can easily identify ELLs who 
regressed one or more English language proficiency levels and as a result we can  implement necessary interventions for them. 
In the same manner we can identify ELLs / FELLs who advanced 2 or more levels and using important notes about the student 
we can identify more areas of improvement.  The EDAT  also provides  very specific data on student’s progress or regress in 
each modality.  NYSESLAT Modality Analysis shows us students who scored high or low in each individual modality. The green 
box shows students who scored high in any given modality. The pink box identifies students who scored low in any given 
modality.  Knowing this will help teachers group students and differentiate  their instruction accordingly.    
 
ELL Data Analysis Tool provides valuable information about student’s attendance and links it to student’s performance across 
years. Knowing this information teachers can emphasize the importance of regular attendance  and its effect on 
performance  while  communicating with parents or guardians of the student. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

   AP  and ENL teachers run the EDAT three /four times a year and share the important information with content area teachers 
and  administrators. For example, at the beginning of the school year we identified at risk level 5,6 and 7 students. The notes 
about each individual student  at risk 5,6 and 7 are forwarded to content area teachers.  This data is discussed during teacher 
teams and common planning time. Teachers are also sent to Borough and City wide ENL trainings when they are offered. 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support, 
emphasizing English language acquisition. Students in our freestanding ENL programs  come from many different 
language backgrounds (Polish, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Uzbek, Tajik), and English may be the only common 
language among the students. As per CR Part 154, in our school we have two 2 types of ENL program: At elementary 
level:•     Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content 
courses. It is delivered by our a certified ENL teacher. A student may not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core

content area instruction. •     Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area 
instruction. It is delivered by a co- teaching by our certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., 
English language arts, math, science, or social studies).  Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content 
area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years 
after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.  At middle school 
level:•    Integrated ENLl: our ENL teacher works with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers 
to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support. •     Stand-alone ENL: ELLs who spend the majority of their 
day in all-English content instruction are brought together from various classes for English-acquisition-focused 
instruction. Our ENL teacher plans carefully with general education teachers to ensure curricular alignment and 
continuity of instruction.  
 
Stand-alone ENL provides instruction in English with home language support, emphasizing English language 
acquisition. 
Integrated ENL builds English language skills through content area instruction. its is delivered by  co-teaching by 
a  certified  ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher. Both stand-alone and integrated ENL include content 
area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           2.    In PS/IS 49 Q we offer only Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) program. We provide instruction in English 
with home language support, emphasizing English language acquisition. Integrated ENL is  instruction to build English language 
skills through content are instruction. It is delivered by co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area 
teacher. Our integrated ENL instruction includes content are subject matter and English language development using ENL 
strategies. 
 
Beginning September 2015, there are 5 proficiency levels for ELLs based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT: Entering (former 
beginner), Emerging (Low Intermediate), Transitioning (High Intermediate), Expanding (Advanced),  the fifth level, 
proficient/commanding, continues to indicate the student is not an ELL.  
  
The following are the units of study per proficiency level in ENL program: 
  
  
Beginner/ Entering- 360 minutes of ENL: minimum minutes of standalone ENL 180 minutes/ minimum of integrated ENL/ELA 
minutes 180 (no flexibility of minimum standalone or integrated ENL) 
  
Low Intermediate/ Emerging -360 minutes of  ENL: 90 minimum minutes of standalone ENL 90 minutes/ minimum of 
integrated ENL/ELA minutes 180 (flexibility of minimum standalone or integrated ENL: 90 minutes) 
  
Intermediate/Transitioning: 180 minutes of ENL:  minimum 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA minutes (flexibility of minimum 
standalone or integrated ENL- 90 minutes) 
  
Advanced/Expanding: 180 minutes of ENL: minimum 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area 
  
Proficient/Commanding: 90 minutes of ENL: minimum 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
  
ENL teacher provide integrated ENL instruction in content area subject matter and English language development using ENL 
strategies. In a push in model, ENL teachers work with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers to 
provide language acquisition and vocabulary support. For example, ENL teacher previews content vocabulary with ELLs 
providing ELL students with kid friendly definitions and visual representation of words, prepares differentiated vocabulary/ 
images packet for a read aloud, modifies questions, finds copies of texts in native language, translates packets, letters sent 
home regarding projects and homework. There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers and/or prior 
collaborative lesson planning.  
 
In our stand-alone program ENL teachers develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. 
For instance, ENL teachers may build ELL students background knowledge by showing them images, cartoons, and video clips. 
They may also  provide glossaries of key vocabulary words, home language versions of texts or abridged version of texts.  
  
  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  In order to ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages we follow the following procedures. When 
NYSITELL  is administered to eligible students and the results are hand scored, we identify ELL students who are not proficient 
in English and we administer Spanish Lab-R to Spanish-speaking students. For Spanish speaking students we order copies of 
Spanish translations of text books for content areas and their unit tests are administered in Spanish. For low inference 
languages we make sure that all ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year. We translate 
units tests, pre-assessments into students home languages for content areas.  
  
  
          
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

       
    At the moment there are no SIFE students in PS/IS 49. However, our plan for a potential SIFE student would include 
developing academic literacy skills in home language (if possible) and English, building background knowledge needed to 
handle grade appropriate curriculum, teaching content knowledge in home language (if possible: content area picture 
dictionaries/ technology based learning), intensive ENL learning leading to mastery of English language.        The needs of 
newcomers are met in the following manner. Parents are interviewed about the child’s prior academic experiences, report 
cards are reviewed, the student is administered the NYSITELL. The results of the NYSITELL  determine the child’s proficiency 
level and ENL instruction is provided accordingly. Newcomers are serviced for the time allocated as per their proficiency level. 
Home  language support in the form of the same home language buddies, picture dictionaries, content area glossaries and 
home language texts is provided to all newcomers. Strong emphasis is placed on visual thinking strategies (VTS) and multi-
sensory language approach. In addition, classroom charts and word walls present in the ENL classroom and ELLs' homerooms 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

are rich in pictures and photographs to provide additional support to the newcomers. Picture book read alouds are 
accompanied by charts and picture flashcards that support students' linguistic and content area development. In addition, 
students are provided with typed up copies of all mentor texts. Copies of read aloud books and other books are available on 
cds and tapes and help students enhance their listening skills.  ENL instruction is based on the idea that students require 
development of BIC’s and CALP’s.  Therefore, students receive both language and content instruction. Students are taught 
both academic functions (analyzing, describing, comparing/contrasting, etc..) and social functions (agreeing/disagreeing, giving 
instructions, expressing feelings, etc..).  Language lessons provide a way for grammar instruction to be taught within a natural, 
meaningful context. Oral/Aural strategies such as providing language stems and barrier games for speaking and listening 
provide students with a scaffold, while requiring students to communicate in order to complete a meaningful task.  During 
Writing students use various scaffolds such as sentence builders, mapping and cloze activities.  Reading scaffolds include: age-
appropriate picture and pattern books, story mapping, anticipatory guides (both picture and words), as well as Directed 
Listening/Reading-Thinking activities.  These strategies provide entering  and emerging with support while challenging them to 
learn content, problem solve and think critically appropriate to their grade level. Another way to make information 
comprehensible is by choosing materials from a variety of sources.  Students are encouraged to use their home language as a 
reference point for learning new concepts.  They may rely on a classroom buddy, or print material in their own language.  They 
are taught to look for connections, such as cognates, in their home language while gaining proficiency in English.  We do this 
because understanding content is just as important as language development.  When materials are not available in the native 
language, technology plays a role in making content comprehensible-images, games, and web quests are a way we support 
comprehension of content material. Newcomers are also enrolled in our Saturday program. Our plan for ELLs receiving service 
4 to 6 years is to constantly review students’ data ( state exams, running records, on demands writing pieces and teacher 
created benchmarks), determine students strengths and weaknesses, set the goals and implement interventions based on the 
data. The ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years are serviced for the time allocated as per their proficiency levels. We emphasize 
their reading and writing development in English.  The plan for these students is to connect reading and writing by carefully 
examining the various literature genres.  Students will focus on features that make each genre unique by looking at areas such 
as organization, style, vocabulary, and author’s purpose.  The idea is that understanding how a genre “functions” will facilitate 
writing in that genre as well.  This method is taken from the “Curriculum Cycle” as described in Pauline Gibbons’ book, 
Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning.  Students will be provided with opportunities to explore and discuss a genre before 
being asked to write about it.  Then, through shared experiences, students write a joint text with the teacher, and finally, 
students will write on their own.  These students will also continue to develop and enhance their Aural/Oral language 
development by learning more advanced ways to use the linguistic functions. They will continue to give their opinions, 
compare and contrast, give directions, etc. in both social and academic conversations as a way of using new vocabulary and 
experimenting with the English language. They will still be provided with some scaffolds, but will rely mostly on each other, via 
discussions, to learn new vocabulary and ways of expressing similar ideas.          Teaching content to all levels of proficiencies 
while exposing them to a variety of literature exposes students to all genres-fiction, non-fiction, poetry, etc…  By the time they 
encounter the ELA for the first time, they have examined and read stories from all genres and have been taught about the 
features unique to each type of genre as well.  Since content instruction is aligned to grade expectations, they are learning the 
information needed to take the state Math, Science, and Social Studies exams.  We do realize state exams measure knowledge 
of content areas. These students are are enrolled in a Saturday program (teachers are trained in ENL methodologies).        At 
present, we have one long term ELL who is also a SWD. Currently, we are evaluating him by conducting a universal screening in 
order to determine his needs, strengths and weaknesses. After we analyze data from various resources we will provide 
intensive , targeted intervention in addition to our strong core instruction. Consequently, we will monitor this student’s 
progress and response to intervention. We will also offer targeted supplemental intervention during our morning programs 
and Saturday school.The plan for other ELLs that have special needs is to review their IEP as well as their language proficiency 
levels. We follow the mandate of the IEP regarding ENL services. We also follow Jose P.  Governance and we make sure that 
students with disabilities are provided with a free public education in a timely manner.        We continue to support those 
students in achieving proficiency in English by establishing a system of articulation between the classroom teacher and the ENL 
teacher. They discuss the students’ strengths and weaknesses and jointly decide on the best strategies in the four modalities 
to ensure continued growth in English. Interactive word walls, rich in pictures and visuals charts are displayed in the ENL 
classroom and in the students' homerooms and they reflect current units of study in reading, writing, vocabulary and word 
study instruction. Rich in content and vibrant language read alouds are accompanied by charts and picture flashcards that 
support students' linguistic and content area development. Students are provided with typed up copies of all mentor texts. We 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

are using Wilson’s Fundations methodology and small group instruction to provide additional opportunities for word work and 
reading comprehension.         All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of 
units of integrated ENL.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  In order to meet the needs of ELL students with disabilities within the least restrictive environment our ENL teachers 
collaborates closely with their teacher. The teachers plan on supporting each other and teaching using both Special Education 
and ENL methodologies.  Our ELL students are serviced for the time allocated as per their proficiency levels.  
Because ESSA now requires ELA testing for ELLs after one year our instructional plan provides for additional support in the 
form of our Saturday program.  This program focuses on developing content area vocabulary and close reading skills. During 
our Saturday academy ELLs learn how to independently handle high complexity grade level text and how to break it down into 
meaningful smaller fragments/ sentences and words.  
Our ELLs with disabilities are provided with visual word walls, bilingual picture dictionaries, content area glossaries, I pads and 
computers with preloaded translators and visual dictionaries. 
Explicit ENL instruction is delivered through our pull out program.  
Our ELLs with disabilities are provided with instruction that develops oral language  and will help them handle the language 
and the knowledge demands of the common core curriculum. 
For ELL SWD students who score below the accepted benchmarks,  a strong core instruction (Tier1) is provided, accompanied 
by rigorous interventions. Some interventions that provide access to academic content and accelerate English language 
development include: 
•     building background knowledge (previewing key concepts and challenging vocabulary, drawing on students’ home 
languages when possible –glossaries, buddies) 
•     close and interactive reading aloud (pretaching vocabulary, sentence structure and concepts, including relevant 
multicultural literature) 
•     Storytelling using wordless books 
•     Teaching intensive vocabulary instruction (study words, word parts, word sorts, word families,  words with multiple 
meanings) 
•     Teaching vocabulary learning strategies (visual cues, TPR, realia) 
•     Language frames for speaking and listening (conversational prompts and accountable talk charts) 
•     Shared classroom experience writing  
•     Dialogue journals 
•     Reading thematically related texts, across genres 
•     Modified guided reading 
•     Reading responses incorporating art, music, drama and poetry 
•     Shared reading 
•     Teaching students multiple ways to show what they are understanding and learning (oral, written, role play and drawing) 
•     Making connections between ELLs home language and English ( cognates, highlighting  similarities and differences 
between syntax, spelling, punctuation in home language and English) 
  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Planning curriculum, instruction and scheduling starts with the individual needs of students and their IEPs. A collaborative 
team of teachers and school administrators meets and analyzes the general education curriculum and students individuals 
needs, strengths and weakness. Our school uses differentiated instruction as a method of helping ELL-SWDs to experience 
success and attain their IEP goals and proficiency within the least restrictive environment. Teachers in our school use flexible 
grouping in order to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve success. For instance, teachers begin with a whole class mini-lesson 
followed by small group or pair work. Grouping and regrouping is an ongoing process and is adjusted constantly to individual 
needs and goals of our ELLs-SWDs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

Supplemental reading, writing and language instruction is provided to our ELL-SWDs in our morning and Saturday programs, 
extended day, in addition to a rigorous ENL program. Our ELLs- SWDS have access to and participate in many before, during 
and after activities. Our school offers band classes, music classes, karate, chess, robotics, basketball, baseball and other. 
Whenever possible our ELLs-SWDs participate in art, gym and music classes during the day in the least restrictive environment. 
Our school uses technology: computers, projectors, smart boards, student i-pad to make new rigorous content accessible to all 
ELLs-SWDs. Using technology gives our ELLs-SWDs opportunity to learn at the own comfort level, pace and modality of their 
choice. 
 
Our teachers utilize a number of research based strategies that help differentiate instruction for our ELLs with disabilities. They 
differentiate content, process and or product based each student's individual needs. For example, to provide differentiation of 
content, they use a variety of instructional delivery methods to address different learning styles, break assignments into small, 
more manageable parts, and  include structured directions for each part. 
 
On the other hand, to differentiate the process, teachers may provide access to a varying of materials, different versions of the 
text based on students' reading levels, develop sensory-based activities targeting auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learners, 
create activities that vary in level of complexity and degree of abstract thinking required, use flexible grouping based on 
content, ability and assessment results. 
 
Lastly, to differentiate the product teacher may use a variety of assessment strategies (self-assessment, peer assessment, 
student created checklist/ rubrics), offer a choice of projects that reflect a variety of learning styles and interest. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Based upon our ELL population, the needs of our 71 students are addressed through stand-alone ENL and Integrated 
ENL  serviced by two fully certified ENL teachers. The teacher mirrors instruction in the classroom and follows the Teachers 
College model while applying ENL strategies and techniques to develop their academic language. The Teacher’s College 
Reading and Writing Program incorporates the state standards: speaking, listening, reading and writing. In addition, all of our 
units of study are aligned with Common Core Learning Standards. The teachers utilizes a balanced literacy approach again 
applying ENL strategies to develop academic language through the four modalities.  
  
Students of all proficiency levels participate in an academically rigorous program.  All students are expected to participate in 
grade-level lessons, and are exposed to grade level content, regardless of their proficiency level.  We accomplish this by 
differentiating instruction based on proficiency level and needs.  Newcomers who are entering/emerging and transitioning are 
placed in flexible groups (heterogeneous and homogeneous), so they can listen to the modeled language of more proficient 
students while completing tasks within the zone of proximal development.  Examples of differentiation at the entering and 
emerging  levels are evident in all areas of language development.  Oral/Aural strategies such as providing language stems and 
barrier games for speaking and listening provide students with a scaffold, while requiring students to communicate in order to 
complete a meaningful task.  During Writing students use various scaffolds such as sentence builders, mapping and cloze 
activities.  Reading scaffolds include: age-appropriate picture and pattern books, story mapping, anticipatory guides (both 
picture and words), as well as Directed Listening/Reading-Thinking activities.  These strategies provide entering and emerging 
ELLs with support while challenging them to learn content, problem solve and think critically appropriate to their grade level. 
  
Another way to make information comprehensible is by choosing materials from a variety of sources.  Students are 
encouraged to use their native language as a reference point for learning new concepts.  They may rely on a classroom buddy, 
use content based bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, or print material in their own language.  They are taught to look for 
connections, such as cognates, in their home language while gaining proficiency in English.  We do this because understanding 
content is just as important as language development.  When materials are not available in the native language, technology 
plays a role in making content comprehensible-images, games, and web quests are a way we support comprehension of 
content material. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

There is an added benefit to teaching ENL through content and differentiating instruction: this form of instruction 
inadvertently prepares newcomers for the New York State exams.  Teaching content to all levels of proficiencies while 
exposing them to a variety of literature exposes students to all genres-fiction, non-fiction, poetry, etc…  By the time they 
encounter the ELA for the first time, they have examined and read stories from all genres and have been taught about the 
features unique to each type of genre as well.  Since content instruction is aligned to grade expectations, they are learning the 
information needed to take the state Math, Science, and Social Studies exams.  We do realize state exams measure knowledge 
of content areas.  Therefore, if a student is very new to the country and has more background knowledge of the content in 
their home language, they will be provided with a way to express that in their language by means of a test in their native 
language or a translator.  Lastly, ENL students receiving content instruction will have an easier time transitioning to the push-in 
model because they have background knowledge of the vocabulary taught in the various subject areas and will be able to 
participate in lessons alongside their homeroom peers. 
  
Although newcomers who are entering, emerging, and transitioning, make up almost half of our ENL population, we have a 
number of expanding and commanding ENL  students as well.  Therefore, during their instructional minutes, we plan on 
emphasizing their reading and writing, listening development in English in their content area classes. The plan for these 
students is to connect reading and writing by carefully examining the various literature genres.  Students will focus on features 
that make each genre unique by looking at areas such as organization, style, vocabulary, and author’s purpose.  The idea is that 
understanding how a genre “functions” will facilitate writing in that genre as well.  This method is taken from the “Curriculum 
Cycle” as described in Pauline Gibbons’ book, Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning.  Students will be provided with 
opportunities to explore and discuss a genre before being asked to write about it.  Then, through shared experiences, students 
write a joint text with the teacher, and finally, students will write on their own.   
  
These students will also continue to develop and enhance their Aural/Oral language development by learning more advanced 
ways to use the linguistic functions. They will continue to give their opinions, compare and contrast, give directions, etc. in 
both social and academic conversations as a way of using new vocabulary and experimenting with the English language. They 
will still be provided with some scaffolds, but will rely mostly on each other, via discussions, to learn new vocabulary and ways 
of expressing similar ideas.   
Home language is supported by grouping ELLs with the same home language buddies, providing glossaries to students in 
content area subjects (social studies, science and math), word to word dictionaries, native language materials and 
multicultural books. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

After analyzing our  NYSESLAT Modality Report (EDAT), we noticed that our entering and emerging students scored low in 
writing. Therefore,  this year our Saturday school will offer instruction in content area writing to entering and emerging 
students. This program will focus on first  developing oral language and vocabulary in content areas and with time the program 
will include content area writing. Emerging and Entering ELLs will learn how to use graphic organizer and/ or paragraph frames 
to help them plan and organize their writing. 
 
Also, based on our NYSESLAT and Math comparison data, we noticed that many of our transitioning and expanding ELLs scored 
low in math. Therefore, we will offer a Saturday school math class for these students. This class will  focus on building  grade 
level math vocabulary to understand complex word problems. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELLs are afforded equal access to all of our school programs. ELL students in our school participate in a variety of school 
programs such as Studio in a School , NY Historical Society and Robotics. Parents are informed about different programs in our 
school by letter and during PTA meetings. Our school continues to offer Band for grades 4 through 8. In our school's Title III 
program it provides support for ELLs in the form of a Saturday Academy which ELL students attend, providing supplies and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

instructional materials such as books on i-pads, multicultural books, reading theater props, picture books, high interest 
beginner and intermediate level fiction and nonfiction books for students in upper grade, projectors and stereos. Our ELL 
students will also participate in an art school after school and a guidance program during our Saturday Academy. In addition to 
letters being sent home, we post all information on website, which is translated to multiple languages furthermore,  we 
provide visual posters advertising these programs by the main office and entrances. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
This year we plan on utilizing personal computers and I-pads during stand alone ENL periods with the ENL teachers. The ENL 
teacher will be able to utilize technology in the form of reading and writing intervention lessons to monitor and intervene 
based on students needs on daily basis.  
 
As far as core content areas are concerned, teachers will use Lexia Reading Core 5 program to supplement and 
differentiate reading and vocabulary instruction for our ELLS. Lexia Reading Core5 provides home language support and is 
therefore a valuable tool for ELLs of all proficiency levels. 
 
In addition, all of our newcomers are provided with bilingual picture dictionaries (Russian, Spanish, Polish) and picture word 
walls, leap pads, books on i-pads and bilingual books, our middle year ELL students who are literate in their home language 
also receive bilingual glossaries available in Spanish, Russian, Bengali, Polish, Korean and Chinese and dictionaries, 
multicultural books, leveled books. 
 
Our long term ELLs are provided with resources to raise the level of their vocabulary: thesaurus and idiom dictionary. Also 
students in upper grades are provided with high interest beginner and intermediate level fiction and nonfiction books in 
English and multicultural books in Spanish.  All of ELLs have access to computers and I-pads in their classrooms and in the ENL 
class.    
 
ENL goals for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding  students are translated into Spanish, Russian, 
Chinese and Polish. Launching of the unit (reading and writing) worksheets explaining the unit's goal and purpose and some of 
the teaching points are translated into Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Russian and Polish (ENL Class). Computers and  projectors are 
used to facilitate and support students' linguistic and content area development. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in our ENL program in the form of bilingual content glossaries, dictionaries, multicultural 
books (Spanish), computers, access to laptops and online translators, translations of some of the reading and writing lessons' 
objectives. We also use buddy system for our newcomers. Our ENL teachers speak a combined four different languages 
(Spanish, Russian, Polish and English) and we utilize them as needed. 
 
For example, our middle school ELLs are equipped with ipads that they take with them to content area classes. They use 
ipads in Integrated ENL classes to scan and instant translate section of texts in science and social studies classes. Also, they use 
ipads with thesauruses installed on them to help them raise the level of their writing.  
 
Moreover, every year we purchase home language versions of read aloud novels (Spanish, Russian and Chinese) studied in 
middle school such as The Giver by Lois Lowry, Night by Elie Wiesel, To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee. Our ELL students are 
able to read and use English and their home language version of the text in their Integrated ENL classes. 
 
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Content area instructional materials and language materials correspond to ELL's ages and grade and proficiency levels. 
Computer based reading and vocabulary programs such as Lexia Core 5 and Teach me K, 1 & 2 are all adaptable to student's 
age, grade and proficiency level. 
For example, our ELLs in K-2  use a handwriting app, sight words app and skip counting app. The computer memorizes and 
stores students information and in  that way if a student uses the same program next year the program will automatically 
adapt to this student's current level/grade.   
During Lexia Core 5 Our ELLS s use computers and I-pads to read short fiction and nonfiction passages with visual prompts, 
engage in word building and vocabulary enhancement and again the program adapts automatically to student's proficiency 
and grade level. 
Our classroom and ENL libraries are rich in books on all levels. We match our ELLs’ reading level with appropriate books and 
vocabulary books. Word study workbooks and word sorts match students' age, proficiency and phonemic awareness stages.  
In addition, PS/IS 49 has its own website. There are many resources of ELLs and their families. Our ENL teachers  have created 
their own webpage with information for parents (forms, parent orientation video), NYSESLAT guides, content area glossaries, 
school calendar and other. All this information is available in 9 different languages.  
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our school assists newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year by providing them and their families 
with welcome kits in their home languages, providing them with bilingual dictionaries, lists of useful websites: google translate, 
starfall, etc.  We have also implemented Lexia, an interactive online reading program which the students can access at home as 
well as in school.    
Throughout the school year ENL teachers and the Parent Teacher Coordinator welcome ELLs and their families in their home 
language. At the beginning of the school year they hold ELL Parent Orientation, and  later on they organize other ELL Parent 
Workshops (e.g. Understanding 5 Proficiency Levels, Preparing for NYSESLAT, How can I help my Child at Home?) 
In addition, parents are provided with translation of letters sent home. Also, our school website is available and accessible to 
ELLs  and their families in  103 different languages. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Spanish, drama and music during the school day and we have after-school Italian, Art, Cooking and clubs. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

As always, extensive professional development activities will continue to take place for the ENL teacher and all the personnel 
who work with ELL students including common branch teachers, subject area teacher, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, 
special education teachers, psychologists, occupational / physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries and parent 
coordinator.  Our pupil secretary will attend DOE workshops pertaining to ELL topics. Professional development activities will 
be consistent with the school’s training for the balanced literacy program and the Teachers College model. In addition, our ENL 
teachers will participate in training sessions to address the needs of the ELL students offered by the district and city. The 
schedule for support and PD will take place during  Monday professional learning sessions. Strategies addressed will include 
differentiated instruction, scaffolding, read alouds, shared reading, interactive word walls for ENL/ELA, word families, linking 
math with literature and using interactive word walls for math.  
We will provide professional development opportunities to teachers of ELLs throughout the school year. Some of the topics 
discussed will be ELL considerations for common core aligned tasks in literacy and in math. Teachers will be presented with 
practical strategies and practices that accelerate academic achievement of ELLs in literacy classrooms. Some of the strategies 
to be discussed will include: vocabulary, scaffolding, us e of native language and  writing in native languages and English (skills 
transfer). 
Some of topics in math will include: pre-teaching essential vocabulary/language functions before beginning the tasks, using 
visuals and realia when introducing new words and concepts, building background knowledge, promoting oral language , 
native language support (peers, home language materials), using graphic organizer and technology in order to enable  access 
to content. 
 
Our ENL and content area teachers attend numerous  workshops offered by  the office of  DELLs, Fordham University NYS/NYC 
Regional Bilingual Education resource Network. For example, our teachers attended a series of workshops on co-teaching 
integrated ENL. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Transitional students who have passed the NYSESLAT in the last 2 years will continue to receive support as they become full-
time members of the mainstreamed classroom.  Teachers of these students will be able to receive support and guidance from 
our ENL teacher to ensure that they continue to develop their English proficiency.  They can suggest strategies to continue 
developing all modalities of language. Our Parent coordinator will continue to facilitate language translation services for the 
parents and students during parent teacher conferences, PTA meetings and other times. The guidance counselor will guide ELL 
students and their parents as they transition to high school by providing them with information about different high schools 
and programs suitable to the needs of ENL students. 
As part of the new CR Part 154, we ensure that a minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all 
teachers is dedicated to language acquisition and best practices for English language learners. We send staff to district and 
borough wide workshops as well as host in-house professional learning sessions facilitated by our ENL teachers, Instructional 
Coach and Assistant Principals. Agendas and attendance sheets as archived with the Assistant Principal. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During our Tuesday parental outreach, our certified ENL teachers call and email parents. We have have staff members who 
speak the languages of our parents. Additionally, our ENL teachers contact parents to come in for meetings prior to the end of 
each marking period.  During these meetings,  teachers discuss academic and social progress being made. 
 
Every year our ENL teachers invite ELL parents to additional parent orientation meetings that are not DOE mandated. For 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

 

example, this school our ENL teachers are going to hold a parent orientation meeting on September 25th, 2017  entitled: 
"Understanding 5 Proficiency Levels". In April of 2018, they will hold another ELL parent orientation entitled : "Preparing for 
NYSESLAT".  During these non-mandated orientations we have staff members fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, Russian, 
Polish and Spanish and these staff members are there to  provide translations to our ELL parents. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Additional support to encourage parents of ELL students is provided by the parent coordinator and the principal. All parents 
are encouraged to have ongoing meetings with teachers and when necessary, translators are provided by the school. Copies of 
all letters are sent home to parents and translated as necessary. Parents of ELL students are included in our school 
community.  We plan on having workshops on the following topics: Internet safety, the High School application process and 
preparing for the State exams. 
 
In addition, every year our teachers organize Cultural Feasts during which children are asked to bring and share 
their traditional dishes with other students. This is an excellent opportunity for our ELLs and their families to get involved and 
share their heritage with other students in our school. 
 
Our school website is accessible to ELL students and their parents in over 103 languages. The website includes a plethora 
of information: school announcements,  daily homework, trips, after school activities, PTA announcements, forms, links to 
helpful websites and others. We encourage all parents to communicate with teachers as often as they need and  using their 
home language, if needed. Our school is also using the REMIND App which is available to parents in 5 languages.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Thomas Carty, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

A parent survey was distributed in June of 2017 asking parents:  

1) In what language they prefer to receive information;  

2) In what form they would prefer translation i.e., written, verbal, or over the phone.  

The parent survey was translated into the predominant languages of our school population. In late August, the 
Home Language Surveys were reviewed to ascertain the language composition of incoming families. In Mid- 
September each homeroom teacher was given an in house document entitled "Home Language Needs", which 
asked them to identify the student's names whose parents read or spoke a language other than English at home. 
A copy of the completed Home Language Needs form, for each class is kept in the Parent Coordinators office for 
easy reference. The original is stored by the teacher in a prominent place for easy reference throughout the year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

The ENL teachers work with the Parent Coordinator and school staff throughout the year to ensure that the 
translations needs of the students are met. A spreadsheet of ELL students that require translations for state 
exams is kept in the Parent Coordinator office as well as with the ELL teacher.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We have at least one staff member who speaks the language of our limited English proficient families. We provide 
these staff members with their contact information to ensure all families are aware of what is going on in the school 
community.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Administration meets with staff prior to the school year beginning to ensure they are aware of these mandates. Staff 
is also provided with the information to utilize the Translation Unit.The Language Access Coordinator meets with 
teachers periodically to ensure limited English proficiency families are receiving all resources and information on their 
language of preference. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any:

Our school has posted signage in multiple languages in the main office and by the security agent's desk to notify 
parents about the translation and interpretation services we have available. As per chancellor's regulations, within 30 
days of school enrollment, a parent's primary language is assessed via interview and recorded on ATS and on the blue 
emergency cards. The ENL teachers and the parent coordinator work together to ensure that parents are informed 
about translation services both at PS/IS 49 and online through the Department of Education website where several 
important documents have already been translated and made available in several languages. For example, the HLIS is 
available in multiple languages at our school. The Parents' Bill of Rights, notification of special services forms, 
notification of citywide ELL parent meetings, ELL parent orientation forms and the parent selection survey are also all 
provided in multiple languages- Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Uzbek are the languages we receive requests for 
translation in at our school. Again, we use in-house school staff, parent volunteers, online resources through the DOE 
and the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit's services to provide oral and written translation resources for our 
parents.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school plans on using the Parent Survey as a primary source of information. We also plan on having our bilingual 
Parent Coordinator conduct interviews with parents to gather their feedback on the quality and availability of 
services. When parent workshops are conducted, we will collect satisfaction surveys and analyze the data. The PTA 
will also be a great resource for us and will be able to provide with a lot of data regarding quality and availability. This 
year we would like to initiate a focus group of parents, inclusive of all cultures and languages represented to discuss 
best practices in communicating to the parent body.
