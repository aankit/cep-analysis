Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission at PS/MS 138 is to meet the social, emotional and academic needs of all students of all students. We 
provide children with rigorous, engaging and current learning opportunities to make them independent thinkers. Our 
vision is to create leaders, one sunrise at a time, while incorporating technology in preparation for real-life 
experiences, college and career readiness in a risk-free and safe environment. Rigor at 138 is defined as teaching and 
learning that stimulates and encourages students to question their assumptions and think deeply. Students should be 
mentally sweating during experiences that are challenging, not necessarily difficult. Students must feel a sense of 
accomplishment and value in their work 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Sunrise School is an elementary/middle school with 790 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 8. The 
school population comprises 83.4% Black, 9.71% Hispanic, 2.81% White, 1% other and 1.66% Asian students. The 
student body includes 5.97% English Language Learners and 18.14% Special Education students. Boys account for 
52.23% of the students enrolled and girls account for 47.77%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017 - 
2018 was 94.0%.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have several different special student populations in our school. These categories include: ICT, Self- Contained, 
Small Group AIS, English as a New Language and English as a Second Language.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Currently at 138, we have seen much growth in the area of student progress, especially with our lowest performing 
1/3 and English Language Learner students . We continue to work in closing the achievement gap for our students 
with special needs. However, we still struggle with performance, identified in Framework for Great Schools element 
titled, Rigorous Instruction, with 34% proficiency, scoring at levels 3 or 4 on the state ELA test and 17..6% scoring 
levels 3 and 4 on the state Math test. Our junior high school students have maintained an average of 90% passing rate 
in their core subjects. Additionally, over the past three years, we have improved greatly on Framework for School 
element - Supportive Environment. We are currently in our third full year of PBIS and its results are exemplified on 
our School Survey.  

 

Our instructional focus will be framework element - Collaborative Teachers. Teachers will be developing students’ 
ability to use academic and content vocabulary as evidenced in stronger writing and discussion through robust and 
engaging work. Our Professional Learning Communities are focused on planning more rigorous lessons around this 
work as well as creating instruction and classroom environment that supports this work. Collaboration among

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the NYS Common Core 2017 ELA scores for ALL Grades (3-8) 23.5% of students met/exceeded proficiency by 
scoring at Level 3/4, which is why we will be focusing on rigorous instruction to ensure that all units continue to be 
aligned to the common core standards and that students are provided with multiple entry points to access the 
information.  

Based on our last Quality Review May 2017, all curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and 
the content standards. Higher order thinking skills are consistently emphasized for all students across all grades. (1.1) 
However, testing data is not reflecting this so we will continue to adjust our practices to meet the needs of all students 
including students with disabilities and English language learners.  

 

Informed by Capacity Framework Element – Rigorous Instruction, current data and our most recent QR, there is a need 
to refine the use of strategies that increase vocabulary acquisition for all students and opportunity for rigorous tasks. 
This needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, student mastery of mathematics fluency skills, facts and vocabulary will increase by 15% by implementing 
"skill drills" evidenced by results from pre and post assessments.

Based on the Advance, additional professional learning is needed in the areas of Designing Coherent Instruction 1E and 
Assessment during Instruction 3D. Although our most recent Quality Review indicated that our curriculum is aligned to 
the common core standards and that teaching strategies promoted higher order thinking, there is a need to make the 
necessary modifications for special education students and English Language Learners. This school year we will focus on 
Danielson's Framework for Teaching components 3B Questioning and Discussion Techniques and 3C - Student 
Engagement to ensure that we meet the needs of all students. 

Informed by Capacity Framework Element – Improvements in teaching and learning, current data and our most recent

Based on the analysis of teacher surveys and advance data from the academic year, teachers need additional 
professional learning opportunities, specifically tiered in a differentiated way. Using Advance data, individualized 
professional development will be afforded to teachers based on their needs. Teacher goal setting will allow them to 
craft their own learning plans that will be supported by the administrative team and by their peers through inter-
visitations and teacher team professional development. Teachers will review data to adjust their teaching practices and 
continually assess each lesson to ensure that there is an impact on student learning. Danielson Component 3D - 
Assessment in Instruction will be the focus on teacher teams in addition to 3B and 3C in order to consistently monitor 
whether students are making progress.

2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           41 

 

Our school developed a comprehensive professional learning plan that addresses Common Core Learning Standards, 
Danielson, our instructional focus and school-wide goals. Professional development opportunities are also 
differentiated based on the needs of groups of teachers and individual teachers.  

 

Our high quality professional development will include but not be limited to the following:  

  Teachers will participate in professional development opportunities conducted by the borough support team, 

instructional lead teachers and Assistant Principals in the content areas of ELA, Math, Science and Social 
Studies and how Danielson can support teaching practices in content areas.  

  The Principal, APs, coaches and instructional lead teachers will attend workshops provided by the 

Superintendent Team relating to CCLS and Danielson. They will turnkey the information and deliver 
workshops or Lunch and Learns to teachers and paraprofessionals in the use of DOK, Essential questions, 
ongoing assessment practices to increase best practices to increase academic rigor in literacy, math, science 
and social studies aligned with CCLS. 
Implementation of the new Core Curriculum (Core Knowledge K-2) & Exp. Learning 3-8 in ELA and Go Math (K-
8) for Math will be supported through high quality professional development for teachers and 
paraprofessionals delivered by the principal, APs, instructional leads network team members or the outside 
educational consultant. 

 

  Teacher teams will be trained in how to use data effectively to develop flexible grouping, track student 
performance trends and elevate programs and strategies in order to monitor and revise their practices.

elementary school program. The team will meet monthly to track student data trends and evaluate overall readiness. 
Eligible students will be provided with early intervention services to address academic and social/emotional needs.  

 

During the year, Pre-K teacher teams and Kindergarten teacher teams will evaluate curriculum for vertical and 
horizontal alignment through the lens of the Common Core Learning Standards to ensure a seamless transition from 
PreK to kindergarten. To ensure seamless transitions, the expectation is that our PreK and Kindergarten teachers will 
engage in Lunch and Learns regarding CCLS for Early Childhood grades. Our school embraces a Parents-As-Partners 
model through professional development opportunities and parent engagement activities that increase parent 
involvement, build parent effectiveness, deepen their understanding of CCLS while elevating high expectations for 
student learning. 

The Pre-K to Kindergarten Transition Team will act as the steering committee for this initiative by meeting regularly 
throughout the school year to monitor the process and suggest revisions to actions and strategies in order to ensure a 
smooth transition from the early childhood Pre K program to the Kindergarten elementary school program . 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The MOSL team attended Central professional development sessions to learn about MOSL and the ADVANCE teacher 
evaluation system. The MOSL team met several times to review all options. The principal’s decision, on the selection 
of the MOSL assessment measures, was informed by recommendations made by the MOSL team. Each month 3 hours 
of professional development is scheduled to provide professional development regarding the use of MOSL 
assessments and ADVANCE to improve instruction. In addition to MOSL, our school uses several appropriate 
assessment measures such as common pre and post unit assessments, predictive assessments, classroom 
assessments, and online assessments. Teacher Teams look at student work and track student performance trends to 
establish flexible grouping and to provide scaffolds and extensions to accelerate student learning. The school also 
uses multiple assessment measures to inform professional development opportunities that are scheduled throughout 
the year and are aligned with Danielson, the Core Curriculum in ELA and Math and to build teacher capacity in the use 
of data assessment results to improve instructional practice. 

As a Title I School wide Program (SWP) school, we qualify for Conceptual Consolidation. We use funding flexibility 
available to us under Conceptual Consolidation to integrate services and programs with the aim of supplementing the 
entire educational program to help all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to 
coordinating services, we maximize fiscal resources by combining federal, state and local funds such as Tax Levy, Title 
I, Title III, PF Set Aside, NYSTL, STH and other available resources to implement activities and strategies to reach 
school wide goals for improvement.  

Through careful planning and implementation of our instructional programs and with guidance and support from our 
Superintendent and Borough team including the Budget Director and Human Resource Director, we will utilize our 
fiscal and human resources to carry out our instructional strategies/activities to achieve school wide improvement. 

 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43 

 

Our school continuously monitors programs, actions and strategies to ensure that they meet the intent and purpose 
of the federal and state program guidelines included in the consolidation so that the needs of our eligible students are 
met. For example: 

● Professional development conducted by the principal, assistant principals, highly effective teachers and grade 
leaders in the areas of Danielson 1E, 3B, 3C, & 3D as well as best practices. 

● Teacher teams engaging in collaborative inquiry by tracking data trends and looking at student work to improve 
teaching practices in all content areas.  

● Textbook and instructional materials purchased for all content areas.  

● Afterschool programs in ELA, Mathematics & ELL.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/MS 138Q Sunrise, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/MS 138Q Sunrise will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will 
provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will 
work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also 
maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

The ENL Academy at PS/MS 138Q will run from November 3, 2018 to June 2019 and will 
service ENL students and ENL-SWDs in grades K-8.  This number is inclusive of those ENL 
students that have scored Commanding or Proficient over the last two years.  The program will 
meet on Saturday mornings from 9:00-11:30am.  A review of NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, 
ELA portfolios, running records, and writing on demand data shows that our ELLs are struggling 
in fluency, reading comprehension, and vocabulary.  The students will practice and apply reading 
strategies with a specific focus on comprehension skills and strategies, vocabulary instruction 
designed for specific application to content area reading, building academic language, writing, 
fluency and decoding phonics. Our hopes are that these students will increase by one proficiency 
level on the NYSESLAT as well as increase their Fountas and Pinnell levels by at least two 
reading levels.   Our students, especially our lower grades need to improve their reading and 
writing skills for continued success in the upper elementary grades, increasing their college and 
career readiness.  A weekly record of attendance will be kept by the Assistant Principal.  All 
parental correspondence will be in English as well as the parents' preferred home language. 
Copies of notifications sent home will be kept by the ENL Coordinator. Additionally, phone calls 
home regarding attendance or parental involvement will be made by the ENL Coordinator in the 
parents' preferred home language. 
Materials to be used include iReady Reading, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, and tiered 
reading and writing and activities to meet individualized students' needs.

The Professional Development program fro Title III teachers and other staff emphasizes making 
content comprehensible and accessible for ENL students.  It is comprised of strategies for 
classroom organization, building background knowledge and application, alternate assessments 
and delivery of instruction.  Our goal is to improve student performance by building capacity of 
all teachers to design and implement a comprehensible, coherent and effective instructional 
program for all ENL students.  The professional development is supplemental and will be

Part C: Professional Development  
facilitated by our lead ENL teacher and Assistant Principal, who have been trained in QTEL and 
in Margarita Calderon's Ex-ELL.  These sessions will take place during collaborative Mondays 
once a month throughout the school year.  During Collaborative Mondays, teachers are provided 
with a menu of various 50 minute workshop sessions twice a month.  Workshops focus on 
various aspects of Danielson (Planning, Classroom management, Instruction, Assessment), 
Inquiry, Data Management, Working with subgroups (ENL/Special Education/Lowest 1/3), and 
testing.  No Title III money will be used for these sessions.  Agendas and attendance for 
workshops will be maintained by the ENL Coordinator.  All workshops will be given by the 
ENL Coordinator who is a licensed ENL teacher that speaks three languages.   
 
It will include the following (schedule is tentative): 
*Scaffolding for ENL instruction-September 18, 2018 
*Incorporating ENL strategies and techniques into content areas (QTEL)-October 2, 2018 
*Using ELA portfolios, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, running records, iReady and writing on 
demand data to make informed decisions for ENLs-November 6, 2018 
*Vocabulary strategies for building content area language-December 4, 2018 
*Foldables for spelling, vocabulary and test prep-January 8, 2019 
*Revisiting ENL data: Areas of focus-February 5, 2019 
*Getting ready for the NYSESLAT:  Strategies for Instruction-March 5, 2019 
We will also receive professional development from our BFSC. 
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
 The parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ENLs are part of the whole school 
approach to an "open door" policy for all families.  We believe that parents have the right to 
participate actively in the teaching and learning their children partake in during the school 
day.  Once the parents see the expectations for teaching and learning, they will be better 
equipped to supplement and advise their children at home.  The Parent Coordinator, PTA, Lead 
ENL teacher, and school administrators will provide the parental engagement 
activities.  Communication with the parents is a priority at PS/MS 138Q. Parents of ENLs are 
provided with notifications of upcoming events via backbacked notifications in their home 
language when available. Parents are provided with a monthly calendar and a parent bulletin as 
well as being informed by telephone via the school messenger program of ongoing school 
community events.  Agendas and attendance will be kept by the ENL Coordinator and Assistant 
Principal. 
Some of our school-wide parent involvement includes the following (No Title III funding will be 
used for workshops):

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 Our school uses the TC assessment to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. Our literacy series, Core Knowledge,  has an 
assessment component as well. We also analyze the reading and writing sections of the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to gather 
insights. The data shows that our students have deficits in both reading and writing skills; the latter being the weakest 
especially with our Arabic speaking students and students with disabilities. Knowledge of the specific strengths and 
weaknesses help teachers drive instruction and added support where needed.  In addition, programs, such as iReady, have 
been implemented to help narrow the gaps.  Our schoolwide instructional focus is also on vocabulary used to strengthen

student writing.  Therefore there is an expectation that all students' writing will reflect an increase in the use of academic 
vocabulary.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

iReady periods during the school day, Teacher's College Assessments three times a year, out of classroom AIS periods in small 
groups, review of iReady data/progress monitoring during Monday professional development, pre-mid-post assessments for 
Go Math, Core Knowledge and Expeditionary Learning. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In order to evaluate the success of our program for ELLs, the ENL teacher collaborates with the content area and classroom 
teachers of these students regarding progress, curriculum, ENL methodologies, and testing concerns. Data is analyzed and 
used to drive future instruction. AYPs are evaluated based on the results of the NYSESLAT and other state standardized tests.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

1:1 Great Leaps in 6-8 week cycles, small group pull out AIS in 6-8 weeks cycles, iReady intervention, AIS components built in 
to Go Math, at-risk Orton Gillingham, Saturday and afterschool iReady program in addition to small group at risk iReady during 
the school day, myON, small group instruction in class with ENL teacher, 1:1 instruction with ENL teacher, at-risk speech 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All of our students at PS/MS 138, including our ELLs, are assessed formatively on a daily basis, as well as summatively in all 
subject areas. Our ELLs are instructed in the Common Core Curriciulum. Our literacy programs, Core Knowledge (K-2), and 
Expeditionary Learning (3-8), our Math Programs, Go Math (K-8), have built-in intervention components for struggling 
ELLs.  Additionally, students identified as at-risk receive small group instruction by a push in teacher as a Tier 2 
intervention.  At-risk speech is also available to all students as a Tier 2 intervention. Any Tier 2 interventions are on a 6-8 week 
cycle and student progress is reviewed monthly during PPT meetings.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Based on the modality breakdown of the NYSESLAT, our ELLs are more proficient in Listening and Speaking than in Reading and 
Writing in all grades. Our ELLs in K-Grade 3 are generally lower functioning (emerging and transitioning) than our Grade 4-8 
ELLs (mostly transitioning and expanding). Our Arabic/Urdu speaking students, who need to learn a new alphabet, have a great 
deal of difficulty in ELA. The majority of our students who take the NYSITELL are our incoming Kindergarten students, many of 
whom score at the entering or emerging levels of proficiency.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL coordinator, Ms. Narcisse, holds professional development at least one Monday each month to discuss the strengths 
and weaknesses of individual ENL students based on the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, state tests, iReady data and Benchmarks.  The 
ENL teachers also use their integrated teaching time as well as common planning time to work with other teachers in 
addressing the needs of their individual ENL students and adjusting the curriculum so that all students have access to the 
content.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

A fully licensed ENL teacher instructs ELLs in the freestanding program for our Entering and Emerging 
students.  Entering and Emerging students both receive 180 minutes of stand alone instruction and 180 minutes of 
integrated instruction a week.  Transitioning students and Expanding students receive integrated ENL for 180 minutes 
a week.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL a week.  All ELLs are grouped heterogenously in 
a class per grade as to facilitate programming and give extra support when needed.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

not applicable 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

not applicable    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           ELLs receive a combination of integrated and stand alone services (depending on the level of the student) Monday-
Friday for the required number of minutes by the ENL teacher, who is fully certified. English is the only language of instruction, 
as we do not have any Bilingual or Dual Language Programs at our school. Entering students receive 180 minutes of stand 
alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL per week.  Emerging students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 
minutes of stand alone ENL per week.  Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL .  If needed, Transitioning 
students will receive flexible scheduling and receive up to 90 minutes of their instruction in stand alone ENL.  Expanding 
students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL per week.  Commanding or Proficient students receive 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL per week for an additional two years.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Through academic rigor and explicit ENL and ELA instruction, all ELLs receive intensive instruction aligned with the Common 
Core Learning Standards. All content area lessons are differentiated to meet students' needs. Teachers of ELLs scaffold 
academic language to support students' participation in content areas. Bridging techniques are used to connect new concepts 
to prior knowledge. Teachers of ELLs also use visuals, realia, drama, and oral presentations to support students' understanding 
of academic content. They also model the use of the language and teach language functions and structures within the context 
of the lesson. All instruction is conducted in English with native language support given by the integrated ENL teacher, who 
speaks English, Haitian Creole and Spanish.  Additionally, all stand alone ENL is content based.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   The test coordinator and ENL teacher ensure that all ELLs in grades 3-8 receive content area standardized tests in their native 
language, if available. In addition, all ELLs are provided translated glossaries and word for word dictionaries.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

There are no SIFE students at PS/MS 138 at this time.  
Newcomers to the country are provided with bilingual dictionaries for their personal use. They are assigned a buddy who 
speaks their native language to make their transition easier and help with content area vocabulary. Library books are available 
in the native language of new arrivals as well. All newcomers are encouraged to attend the Saturday boot camps, Title III, 
after-school iReady Academy and Summer School Programs. 
ELLs who have been receiving ENL services for four to six years are usually at the Commanding or Expanding level in Speaking 
and Listening based on the NYSESLAT, but require intensive instruction in Reading and Writing, as well as phonics instruction. 
These students are encouraged to attend Title III and Saturday Bootcamp for Literacy to help them acquire the literacy skills 
needed to become proficient in all four modalities of English. 
The long term ELLS at our school are all Students With Disabilities. These students receive additional instruction on iReady 
which automatically differentiates according to the students' reading level. They also attend the Title III program and Saturday 
Boot Camp. 
Former ELLs who are proficient/commanding are monitored for progress and receive ENL for .5 units of services a week for 
two additional years after testing out of the program.   Articulation between the ENL teacher and the classroom/content 
teachers continues throughout the year. As per the New York State regulations, these students continue to receive testing 
modifications on all standardized tests for two consecutive years after scoring commanding on the NYSESLAT.     
Additionally, grade level materials with ELL supports are available in the Ready Teacher Toolbox for ELA and math.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In order to provide access to acdemic content areas and accelerate English language development, ENL strategies are used by 
the ENL teacher and the classroom/content area teachers. These strategies include scaffolding, activating and building on prior 
knowledge, using hands-on activities, graphic organizers, visual representations, and bilingual and picture dictionaries. Pre-
reading strategies are used and tiered vocabulary words are emphasized.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL- SWDs receive all services as per their IEPs.  At the beginning of the schoolyear, all service providers meet to ensure that 
there are no conflicts in scheduling, so that these students receive all necessary services. Flexible schedules allow for various 
Special Education teachers to push in to the classes of these students. Whenever feasible, students are mainstreamed for 
certain content area classes.  Self contained classes are programmed parallel to ICT classes to allow for flexible scheduling for 
students who have shown they are performing on grade level as per iReady diagnostic testing given three times a year.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs include iReady, a reading comprehension and math computer program for grades K-8, 
Title III Saturday Academy, Saturday Bootcamp for ELA and Math, AIS Speech, small group AIS, and At-risk Counselling. All of 
these programs are conducted in English only.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we are continuing to use iReady to track student progress in math and reading.  This is a computer based program 
that levels to the student's ability and therefore causes less test frustration.  The end result is a grade level equivalent, lexile 
level for reading, a national percentile ranking, a chart that explains where students are not meeting the standards and 
provides the top learning objectives for individual students.  It also does the same for math. We also look forward to the new 
NYSITELL in February 2018 that will better align with the NYSESLAT. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

We do not have a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We offer our ELLs access to all school programs. All ELLs are invited and encouraged to attend The Greater Ridgewood Youth 
Council after school program, iReady after school and Saturday program, Title III, and Saturday Bootcamp for Literacy and 
Math. If eligible, our elementary students receive 5:1 AIS services, 1:1 Great Leaps and at risk iReady. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELLs have access to the Internet using computers in their classrooms. There are also two Computer Labs in the building, 
which are accessible to all students. Our ELLs use iReady, a computer program, to develop new vocabulary and improve 
reading comprehension and math skills. This program also has an at-home component, which encourages our ELLS to extend 
their learning after school hours. myON is another computer program that gives students access to a database of books at 
their reading level.   Bilingual dictionaries and native language books are available to our ELLs. Our Literacy and Math programs 
have a built-in ELL component, which is helpful to the teachers of our ELLs.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is facilitated through the ESL classroom library, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, translated 
materials, and peer translators and grouping. Cooperative learning allows the newcomers to communicate in their native 
language while learning social language, and then transition into academic language. This allows students to be grouped with 
other students who are familiar with the specific native language and have a higher level of English proficiency. Both ENL 
teachers and several other pedagogues speak Spanish, which helps assist our Hispanic ELLs. Many of our teachers and Special 
Education paraprofessional speak French and Haitian Creole, which are the native languages of the majority of our ELLs.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Required services, instruction, support, and resources correspond to the ages and grade levels of our ELLs. Dual language 
books, glossaries, and dictionaries, hands-on manipulatives, audio/visual materials, and computer programs that are available 
to our ELLs are age and grade level appropriate.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELLs have access to the Internet using computers in their classrooms. There are also two Computer Labs in the building, 
which are accessible to all students. Our ELLs use iReady, a computer program, to develop new vocabulary and improve 
reading comprehension and math skills. This program also has an at-home component, which encourages our ELLS to extend 
their learning after school hours. MyOn is another program available to our students that has a database of literature available 
to our students at their reading level.   Bilingual dictionaries and native language books are available to our ELLs. Our Literacy 
and Math programs have a built-in ELL component, which is helpful to the teachers of our ELLs.  Currently our school is not co-
located. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In March and April early registration is conducted for parents of incoming students for the following September. The ENL 
teacher meets with the parents of potential ELLs and offers suggestions to get their child prepared for school. Whenever 
possible, materials are offered to the parents in their native language. Translators are contacted through the translation 
services if necessary. New ELLs who register throughout the year are assigned a buddy who speaks their language to assist the 
newcomer in getting acclimated.  Additionally, our parent coordinator offers workshops for our entire school community to 
attend.

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 All ELLs in Middle School (Grades 6-7) are required to take a class in Spanish as a Foreign Language. Sixth and seventh graders 
have Spanish class twice a week.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The Professional Development Plan emphasizes the Common Core Curriculum as it relates to our ELLs.  Classroom teachers in 
all grades have common prep periods so that professional development, planning, and gathering of data can take place. 
Professional development of ELL personnel also takes place during our Tuesday afternoon PD time and on Professional 
Development days. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers of ELLs are also encouraged to attend the many Common Core 
workshops pertaining to ELLs offered by the Department of Education throughout the year.   Additionally, the ENL coordinator 
has a monthly meeting on Monday afternoon to train whole staff in ENL strategies.  This includes administration, common 
branch teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, social worker, school psychologist, content teachers, special 
education teachers, the occupational therapist, speech therapists, parent coordinator and secretaries.  
Our ENL teachers attend workshops and webinars offered by our Borough Field Support Center.  Additionally, they 
attend professional development offered by the Department of English Language Learners.  She then turnkeys this information 
to our integrated ENL teachers as well as the rest of our staff through professional learning communities. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Meetings are conducted in the spring with the staff and students transitioning from our elementary school to our middle 
school. Being as our elementary school and middle school are housed in the same building, there is a smooth transition for the 
students. Our ELLs have the continuity of the same ENL teacher when they are in middle school. Also, our 5th grade is 
departmentalized for several subjects. This makes the transition to middle school that much easier.  
Several meetings are held for students who will be graduating from 8th grade and going on to high schools throughout the city 
of New York. Parents of these students are invited to attend as well. Our guidance counselor also holds workshops for these 
students to explain the high school selection and application process.  The guidance counselor attends monthly mandated 
meetings held by our BFSC where he receives training in how to assist ELLs as they transition.  
Teachers attend 15% of total hours of ELL training for language acquisition and best practices for ICT and integrated ENL.  This 
training is offered through various workshops given by the New York City Department of Education as well as during 
professional learning times on Monday afternoons.  The school's approach to professional development is informed by a 
theory of actions and results.  Structures of professional development are in place, including but not limited to, whole school 
access to PD 360.  This approach to professional development allows teachers and paraprofessinals opportunities to 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65 

 

 

coordinate and customize their own professional development to meet their students' needs.  Additionally, the school 
maintains a professional development calendar that ensures professional development aligned to the citywide instructional 
expectations, positive student outcomes for all students and a comprehensive data driven teaching and learning 
program.  Furthermore, teachers may attend any outside professional development at their discretion and are required to turn 
key the latest information to all teachers.  The ENL teachers also attend professional development workshops and webinars 
through our Borough Field Support Center.   Records of attendance are kept by the ENL Coordinator, Ms. Narcisse, in room 
203.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides an annual meeting with parents of ELLs.  Letters are sent home in the parent's preferred language 
indicating time and place of the meeting.  Bilingual staff as well as content area teacher s are available during this meeting.   If 
parents are unable to attend this meeting, a phone call is places through the Language Translation Unit, if applicable,  to 
discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's NYSESLAT results and language 
development needs in the content areas.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of all students, including ELLs, are encouraged to participate in all workshops and meetings. These activities are 
offered during the school day, after school, evenings, and on Saturdays. Examples of these workshops include: Homework 
Help, Math, Test Prep, Common Core, Resume Writing, and Science. Refreshments are served at these events, and childcare is 
offered.  The parent coordinator, Kim Johnson, is available to all parents in assisting them with various needs and will seek out 
translators available in the school building or use the Translation Unit if necessary.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, James Mc Enaney, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon registration,parents of ELLs are give a Home Language Identification Survey. The form is completed in the 
language of their choice. On the student's Emergency Contact card, the language of preference will be noted and 
added to the ATS record. The ENL coordinator analyzes the data in order to identify the home languages. Then, 
the data is organized on a spreadsheet by language and grade. This data is then shared with the staff for 
communication, translation and interpretation with the parents.
