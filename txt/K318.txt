Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement: The parents, teachers, and administrators of Intermediate School 318 firmly believe that all 
students can achieve excellence and meet high and demanding academic standards. By fostering a strong home and 
school partnership, we are committed to creating a safe, nurturing educational setting in which all students can excel. 
Every person in our school community will be dedicated to improving student achievement. Through the creation of a 
learning environment that inspires students, we believe that we can meet and exceed any goal, as well as prepare for 
the challenges ahead. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

I.S. 318 has collaborations and partnerships with the following:  

Brooklyn Tech High School STEM Pipeline Program; Partnership with Urban Advantage for Science teachers; New York 
Pops (music enrichment); District and Citywide Jazz Program; Summer arts institute and the Brooklyn Queens Boro-
wide (Salute to Music); Music Enrichment Program; Helen Keller Foundation; Toys-For-Tots; Thanksgiving food drive; 
Winter coat drive; Sports and Arts In Schools Foundation; Neighborhood Development Grant (NDA); Beat-The-Streets; 
Rachael Cooper Foundation Walk-A-Thon; Greenpoint Lions Club; Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) and Middle School 
Quality Initiative (MSQI). 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a group of students who are classified as "alternate assessment" and/or ACES. Their needs include one to 
one paraprofessional support, academic interventions, related services and adaptive physical education. These 
supports are provided successfully by the school. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our strengths and accomplishments include our Arts and Gifted and Talented Programs, in which all students have 
the opportunity to engage and participate in many of these programs that are aligned to the common core and 
promote critical thinking. 95% of our 8 th graders are accepted to their 1 st or 2 nd choice of high schools. 42% of our 
8 th graders are eligible to take 3 to 4 regents and of this 42%, 44% pass their regents courses with proficiency. Our 
populations of lowest 3 rd performers consistently show gains in the NYS Common Core Assessments in both ELA and 
Math. Our students are fully prepared for the challenges and rigor of High School programs. 

Our challenges maintaining over 95% attendance average every year; 100% immunizations, which we have been in 
compliance with every year; funding our at-risk interventions: (ex: ESL, counseling services.) 

In 2017 – 2018 our students were very successful in attaining growth from our

Our lowest score on the school surveys administered in 2017 was in the area of Academic Expectations. While still very 
positive, there was definite room for growth in our outreach efforts to our parents. Additionally, a review of course 
failure rates indicates a consistent problem with a portion of our student community completing homework 
assignments and general organization issues.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. I.S. 318, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

IS 318 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

We intend to service all 68 of our ESL students with the services provided below. The rationale 
is that all ESL students will be able to increase their test scores on all assessments and  projects, 
and will be able to participate with a high level of understanding during classroom discussions. 
These Title III programs are designed to meet the needs of all our ESL students. All instructional 
materials purchased will be used exclusively for the Title III supplemental program. Each 
activity will meet for no less than 20 sessions. The program will begin in October 2018 and run 
through May 2019. 
Each ELL has unique needs depending on their native language proficency, cultural background, 
motivation, effective filter, interests and learning profile.  Through supplemental activities and 
differentation, we can attempt to both raise student test scores and improve students academic 
skills throughout the content areas.  Therefore, we have created a  Title III Saturday program that 
meets three times  a month.  Every Saturday (8:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.) three groups of 15 ESL 
students will meet with Ms. McKoy (ICT teacher certified in Math (gen ed and special ed) , Miss 
Nunziata (certified in both ESL and Special Education) and Miss Diker (special educaton, 
ELA and Wilson certified). Students will receive intervention services  in ELA and in Math. 
Each group will meet for 85 minutes.  (There is a 5 minute break between classes to allow for 
travel within the building.) While one group is with Miss Nunziata receiving ELA enrichment, 
the other is receiving math enrichment with Ms. McKoy.  Special education ELL's will be 
receiving ELA and Math  instruction and enrichment with Miss Nunziata, Miss Diker and  Miss 
McKoy all certified special education teachers who will reinforce writing in ELA and Math and 
word generation, that is taught across the curriciulums during the school day. During the week, 
(on various days and periods)  6th, 7th and 8th grade ELL's will receive additional assistance in 
ELA, Science and Social Studies from Miss Nunziata and Mrs. Mroz (certified ESL and Art 
teacher).  
Instruction on Saturdays will consist of, but not be limited to, Achieve 3000 and Mathletics, both 
computer generated programs designed to increase lexile levels in reading and performance 
levels in math 
6th and 7th grade Gen. Ed and ICT  ELL's will be receiving small group instruction in Math and 
ELA 4 days a week  for 45 minutes  from Mrs. Mroz. 6th, 7th and 8th grade special education 
ELL's will receive small group instruction in Math and ELA from Miss Nunziata.  
 Students will be introduced to new vocabulary words that will enrich their academic English 
language acquisition skills. The language of instruction will be English. Some students, who 
struggle with basic phonemic awareness, are given time to work with the Lexia Reading 
Program.  In addition to the Lexia program, students may be directed to work on Uptown 
Education, where Ms. James has posted vocabulary lists relevant to her ELA class as well as the

through interactive activities involving the Smart-board in her classroom.  Ms. James regularly 
meets with the students' teachers to determine what skills the students need to develop. 
 Co teaching will use the same model as our Integrated Collaborative Teaching model: During 
instruction teachers will differentiate by working with small groups, delivery of instruction and 
differentiated assessments. 
Ms. James will also use National Geographic Theme Sets to supplement students' learning in 
science and social studies.

  Teachers and staff, who are responsible for the delivery of instruction to LEP 
students, will have the opportunity to participate in both region and city-wide professional 
development 
programs for teachers of ELLs. The school is committed to keeping the staff informed of 
applicable out 
of school professional development. At the beginning of each month teachers and staff receive a 
calendar of events and opportunities from the Office of ELLs. Additionally, teachers are 
encouraged to 
participate in a variety of intensive QTEL seminars ranging from literacy development of ELLs 
to specific 
content area QTELs. Finally, our school offers a wide ranging series of professional literature 
related 
towards the instruction of ELLs available at any time in our staff library. 
Additionally, the 6th grade staff meets every Tuesday morning from 7:25am - 8:20am as a study 
group, for Professional Development, comprised of all content area teachers and the ESL 
teachers ( Kimberly Mroz and Meghan Nunziata) will be focused on improving the 
understanding of ELL Instructional practices that will lead to improved student performance in 
the classroom. The team has chosen 5 ELL students to focus on and is continually revising their 
goals and creating actions plans for their academic and social-emotional development 
accordingly. 
Topics discussed in this Professional Development include: How to understand the results of 
NYESLAT and LAB tests for the classroom teacher, Focusing on the ELL student in the Science 
and Social Studies Classroom, Teaching Writing Techniques to the ELL student and Utilizing 
Manipulatives in the Math Classroom for the ELL population. Our goal is to offer one additional 
professional development session per month, beginning in November, 2018.  We plan on using 
the Inquiry Spaces on ARIS to connect with similar schools that are working on improving the 
performance of ELL students. We will rely on data from  ATS and NYSED NYSESLAT results. 
The Title III PD Program will begin November 17, 2018 through May 4, 2019. The dates for the

  Student success is clearly influenced by parent involvement. When parents are informed about 
their child's education and needs, they are better able to support them at home. 
With this in mind, IS 318 has taken various steps to include the parents of ELLs in their 
children's education. Parents will be notified of these workshops via "back pack" letters home 
and Jupiter grades.; 
Beginning in November 2018 and through June 2019 parents of ELLs  will be engaged in

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
I.S. 318 uses predictive ELA exams to look at our students literacy skills in conjunction with the data coming from teachers 
based on in-class testing. This data generally shows that our ELLs have significantly lower literacy than their EP peers. With this 
knowledge, the staff provides extra literacy instruction to those in need through extra periods of ELA, smaller classes, and 
direct ELA instruction. 318 also uses the Degrees of Reading Power Assessment (DRP) to determine students reading level. 
Fountas and Pinnell level can also be determined through the DRP score. Our school conducts MOSL Assessments, Measures of 
Student Learning. The MOSL score determines growth of student leanring.  RAS test which provides plethora data concerning 
students levels in various skills such as making inferences, finding information and making connections. Reports are generated

for each class and each student. The teacher can look at a report and learn exactly what skills a child needs to develop based 
on the questions they got wrong.  Lastly, our school uses technology as an assessment tool to assess the early literacy skills of 
our ELLs. The on-line tools we use are called Reading Plus and myON. The programs  motivate   students to learn through 
extensive reading, comprehension questions, vocabulary games and encourages intrinsic motivation for reading. Reading Plus 
calculates students reading level through various assessments. The goal at the end of 24 weeks is to see students at or above 
grade level.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Principal, Assistant principal and ESL teachers will look at the data throughout the 24 weeks to assess areas of improvement 
and areas where more supports are needed. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  I.S. 318 values both the data from test scores as well as both quantitative and qualitative data from teachers. I.S. 318 
leadership and teachers believe that ELLs are successful when they are able to interact with their EP peers and excel 
acadmically in a heterogeneous language environment.  I.S. 318 also evaluates the success of the ENL program by looking at 
the progress of students scores on both the Math/English State Test as well as the NYSESLAT.  The ENL program is viewed 
successful if the amount of students who have passed out of the English as a Second Language program is higher than the prior 
year, if the student made any individual growth on each modality, as well as improving on the state tests.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The after school reading and math recovery program is designed to support students who have difficulties in reading, writing 
and problem solving across the content areas. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
It is apparent that students' grade level does not correspond with their proficiency level. Rather, it is years of service that seem 
to be the determining facts. Long term ELLs have high scores while newcomers certainly have lower scores. Across all levels 
students struggle with making inferences and drawing conclusions. This is higher order thinking which their EP peers also 
struggle with. Necomers and emerging students also struggle with grammar and vocabulary (especially in their writing). Long 
term ELLs generally struggle specifically on tasks that require higher order thinking. Long term ELLs also struggle with writing 
tasks. This is probably due to their learning dissablities or the fossilization of bad habits in their English development.  
NYSITELL data reveals that students with some prior knowlege score higher than students with little or no knowledge.  Also, 
students that have a developed first language will score and have scored better than students that have a weak L1.   
NYSESLAT data reveals that almost all students find the listening and writing section to be the hardest. Student struggle to 
listen and then take notes.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The Title III program is designed to assist students in all domains of Math, science , ela and social studies.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 All grades travel in blocks and are heterogenous grouping.  According to the NYSESLAT scores, the majority of our 
students are leveled at Expanding and Commanding.  All ESL students are grouped together according to level.   
Three sixth grade classes receive Push-In services from an ENL provider four times a week. The ENL teacher pushes 
into ELA and a content area class. (Some students in the push-in class need additional services, so they are pulled out 
for an additional three periods a week with and ENL provider). The other two sixth grade classes have students who 
are at a commanding level, so they receive 90 minutes of push-in services with an ENL provider.  
Seventh and Eighth grade classes receive Push-In and pullout services the same way as the sixth grade classes. The 
push-in services are being administered during their ELA as well as content area classes.   
SWDs who take alternate assessments are placed in a class with Amy Vericella and Megan Nunziata, dual-certified 
Sped. ESL teachers.  
General education classes are grouped homogeneously according to test scores and teacher recommendation, thus, 
most Beginners and Intermediates are clustered, allowing an ESL teacher to push in to content classes in order to 
comply with the mandated minutes.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                Pursuant to CR Part 154.2 mandates, parental-guardian/student interview, Program Selection Survey, NYSITELL, 
NYSESLAT data results and student assessment/progress during the school year the resulting implication for instruction is as 
follows: Beginners/Entering students receive a total of 360 minutes of ENL, with 180 minimum minutes of standalone ENL. 
Within the total number of minutes the entering student must receive a minimum number of 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA. Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive a total of 360  minutes of ENL, with 90 minimum minutes of standalone 
ENL. With in the total number of minutes the emerging student must receive a minimum number of 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA.  Intermediate/Transitioning students receive a total number of 180 minutes of ENL, with a minimum of 90 minutes in 
standalone ENL. Within the total number of minutes the transitioning student must receive a minimum number of 90 minutes 
of integrated ENL/ELA.  Advanced/Expanding students receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL. The advanced or expanding 
students can receive a minimum of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area classes.  Proficient/Commanding 
students receive a total of 90 minutes of ENL. This can be integrated ENL/ELA or other content area classes. Our school 
provides after school for all students who need additional help/support in there classes.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      Through supplemental activities and diferentiation, we will attempt to both raise student test scores and improve students 
academic skills throughout the content areas. 
        In our ELA classrooms, core content is delivered through EL (Expeditionary Learning).  EL is aligned with Common Core 
Learning Standards and also provides an abundant amount of supplemental activities for ENL students, which is of course 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65 

 

differentiatied. Each child is provided a novel plus a workbook to be used that coorelates with the novel.  
        In the Math classrooms, teachers are using GO Math, which is aso aligned with Common Core Learning Standards. Each 
child is also provided GO Math workbooks to be used in class and at home.  Each Unit has differentiation lessons for ENL 
students. 
        For our Science and Social Studies department the material is much more difficult for our ENL's to understand. Teachers 
make sure their lessons are comprehensible and that students are given plenty of graphic organizers, and vocabulary 
strategies to foster language development. Teachers try to link the new information to prior knowledge as well as use 
cooperative learning strategies. Since our school is adjusting from pull-out method to push-in method, the ESL teacher 
provides content area support for ELL's. ESL teachers use additional materials such as worksheets and graphic organizers to 
help ELL students and support them. The language of instruction will be English.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      Since our school only provides Free Standing English as a New Language,  students are provided with supplementary 
materials in their home language. All staff is given documentation of how each student's parent/guardian would like to receive 
information provided in their home language. These materials include formative and informative assessments, dictionaries, 
and other reading materials.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

         At I.S. 318 instruction is differentiated across content area. Instruction is differentiated through a variety of methods. 
Students are provided with pre, during, and post reading activities that appeal to a varity of learning styles and intelligences.  
        SIFE students need supportive environments that respond to their immediate social, cultural, and linguistic needs. 
Teachers make sure to activate prior knowledge, provide lots of visuals, and comprehensible input,  engage students in hands-
on learning so students are physically involved, and use teaching strategies that weave together language and content 
instruction. 
        Newcomers and Developing students are supplied with laptops. They are to use them throughout the day during class. I.S. 
318 also uses Reading Plus, a online program that assesses reading, vocabulary and comprehension skill. This program is 
differentiated according to their reading/comprehension level.     
        Students struggle most in listening and writing modalities, therefore in the ENL pull-out and the ENL/ELA classroom,the 
teacher is equipped with MP3 players that are used during reading. The teacher records the reading and the students listen 
and read at the same time. This is particularly helpful for students with special needs that may have processing issues as well 
as newcomers who may need assisstance with phonemic awareness.   
        Former ELLs are required a minimum of 90 minutes of service as per CR Part 154.2.  These students receive push-in 
services and are given assistance in their content area classrooms. 
        Testing accomodations for ELLs and former ELLs receive time and a half on all Exams (local and state). Students also are 
given bilingual dictionaries. 
        Struggling readers are also given the opportunity to use the myON reading program which is closely monitored and 
supported by the teacher. The teacher regularly uses a Smartboard and content provided on the SmartExchange website. 
Employing the SmartBoard, the teacher uses BrainPop to deliver and practice multimedia instruction.  
         
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At I.S. 318, teachers use various instructional strategies and grade-level materials that provide access to academic content 
areas and accelerate English language development. Expeditionary Learning, which is used in grades 6-8,  is one learning 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66 

 

program we use thoughout our ELA department. This program allows teachers to use both formal and informal assessments. 
This program provides common core grade-level material. Not only does it provide rich instructional strategies, but it allows 
our teachers access to rich academic content throughout the curriculum. Another program that I.S. 318 uses is Middle School 
Qualitative Initiative, MSQI.  Students are given an assessment, 3 times throughout the year, which shows growth in reading 
levels. According to students Degree of Reading Power score, students are split into groups. Depending on students scores 
they can either be grouped into Wilson Just Words program, Literature Circles, and Small Group Circles.  MSQI also provides 
our school with Word Generation, which is a vocabulary enrichment program. We implement technology throughout the 
content areas. For example, we use myON as well as Reading Plus Program. These programs aid in accelerating English 
language development.  
        All ELL-SWDs receive services mandated on their IEPs. Each teacher is fully aware of which student has an IEPs and the 
time alloted to each child for their services, whether it be ESL, Speech services, Resource… Each teacher is given a report made 
from our special education department describing the students, their grade/class, that has an IEP. They are made aware of the 
testing accomodations as well for all testing. Mrs. Kalaydjian ensures that ELL-SWDs, whose IEPs mandate ESL instruction 
receive appropriate ESL instructional time according to the new law.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        At I.S. 318 we ensure that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers. Also, the ESL, AIS, 
Speech and other mandated service providers collaborate to meet the goals specified in each student's IEP. For example, the 
ESL teacher will provide students with time on myON, and Reading Plus  in collaboration with the AIS services for phonemic 
awareness. Parents are also invited into the process of differentiation. Teachers regularly communicate with parents through 
the Jupiter Grades program to provide extra feedback and suggestions for literacy improvement. For example, the ESL teacher 
communicated with the parents of a long-term ELL and gave their family access to Reading PLus login for at home use.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 To ensure that our ELLs meet and exceed standard we have instituted a number of additional targeted interventions for both 
students, parents and teachers of ELLs.  One example is in ELA, students need additional help in decoding and phonics. Our 
school uses Wilson and Wilson Just Words. Students also need Tier 1-Tier 3 vocabulary targeted.  Another example, is in Math 
students struggle with word problems, so teachers make sure to use visuals.  Targeted Intervention is also required from our 
Social Studies and Science department. All students at I.S. 318 have the opportunity in a wide range of extracurricular activities 
from chess, botany, band, ceramics, guitar, dance, and sports to digital film. The programs letter home is translated into 
Spanish and the ESL teacher makes sure all students understand what is offered using leveled language and sometimes Google 
Translate.  Specific programs for ELLs include a place for homework help and time in the computer lab with a certified ESL 
teacher. Afterschool homework sessions often are used as periods of instruction to review content area material that is below 
and far below current grade level standards and goals.  SIFE and 6th grade students are also eligible to participate in an after 
school preperatory that concentrates on math and ELA enrichment. Students with an IEP who do not attend a self-contained 
SPED class, may receive math and ELA support services during resource room.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  ESL teacher is providing Push-In serviceses in both ELA and content areas. Our school is also running the same program called 
MSQI, and Wilson Reading Program for all grades. This program is for students who were identified as struggling readers.  The 
Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) is the New York City Department of Education's focused effort to expand the number of 
middle schools that prepare students for college and career success. MSQI serves as the city's implementation plan for putting 
the Carnegie Reading Next report recommendations into action. The project has been guided by a vision for literacy reform 
described in Reading Next and put into practice by a team of committed and experienced literacy leaders in the city.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The school provides all ELLs with equal access to all school programs during the school day, such as general music, band, chess, 
visual arts, physical education, computer, math club, and science club.  All ENLs are also invited to participate in the same 
after-school enrichment programs with all the other students in the school, such as orchestra, sports, dance, and drama club. 
Although, most ENL students are in a split English/Math enrichment program that supports ELA and Math content materials.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 The school is currently using technology to enhance the instruction of all students and ENLs in particular.  All ENLs have school 
and home access to Reading Plus Program and myON Reading Program.  Teachers of ENLs often use BrainPOP to enhance 
lessons through interactive quizzes, games and animated movies with closed captioning.  Some ELA teacher uses pre-recorded 
media on MP3 players for struggling readers or children with auditory processing challenges. Some teachers also purchase the 
novel on CD for auditory listeners. We also use scaffolding techniques, group work, cooperative learning methods, and 
literacy-based thematic units throughout the school. While native language is not used in ESL settings, refence materials are 
available in the classroom, as are non-fiction books related to science and social studies in the school library.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the beginning of the school year, to support each student, the ESL teachers provide each ENL student with a bilingual 
dictionary in their home language.  These dictionaries can be used in class or at home.  In addition to English books found in 
the leveled multicultural classroom library, books in Spanish, Polish, French and Chinese are available.  For beginners ENLs 
textbooks are available in the native language and instruction in small groups can be in the native language. The classroom 
environment will further support high standards of learning and academic rigor. Each classroom includes leveled libraries in 
both languages with a concentration of content related books. Word Walls and strategy charts in both languages reinforce 
critical skills.  Teachers also provide buddies/partners who speak the same native languages for newly enrolled ELLs.  Teachers 
in the building who speak various naïve languages also serve as translators for newly enrolled ELLs.      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

In order to make suitable informed decisions for the appropriate support of instruction, our teachers consider the information 
gained in the assessment stage as well the students scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA State exam, and Math State exam. Teachers 
also collaborate and use other educators opinions in our school. Depending on the students proficiency level, the students is 
then given the appropriate support and resources.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 The school is currently using technology to enhance the instruction of all students and ENLs in particular.  All ENLs have school 
and home access to Reading Plus Program and myON Reading Program.  Teachers of ENLs often use BrainPOP to enhance 
lessons through interactive quizzes, games and animated movies with closed captioning.  Some ELA teacher uses pre-recorded 
media on MP3 players for struggling readers or children with auditory processing challenges. Some teachers also purchase the

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The school has a summer program for all entering sixth grade students every year, and one of the programs offered over the 
summer is ESL specific and taught by a fully ESL certified pedagogue.  The program prepares students for academic English at

the middle school leve, with an emphasis on English for content and writing. Throughout the year new ELLs who enroll can also 
participate in our Title III after school program.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

  Current language electives include Spanish Native Language Arts for non-native speakers.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
There will be highly effective professional development plans in effect for all ELL personnel at the school.  Our school will 
provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English language 
learners.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by 
CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a New Language 
teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to language 
acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.   
Workshops for staff in all content areas is incorporated throughout our school year.  Every month there are grade conferences, 
where a grade/ whole meets to discuss strategies for the future. Every week: Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday there are 
network meetings, content area meetings and workshops for all teachers.   
Various professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  Mrs. Kalaydjian will be attending PDs and then reporting back to teachers of ELLs and assisting them with 
information to support ELLs with Common Core Learning.  For example one workshop she will be attending is the Office of 
Teaching and 
 Learning’s Instructional Practice Series: Differentiating Instruction for ELLs and SWDs in the Content Area Classroom. This is a 
three day workshop where she will be working closely with one of her co-teachers as they explore differentiating instruction in 
the content areas.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 I.S. 318 recognizes its commitment to maintaining high standards of professional development, collaborative planning and 
securing certified and exceptional instructional staff. All first year teachers at I.S. 318 receive 10 hours of professional 
development in ESL methodology during which teachers read and discuss articles related to best practices in the content area 
instruction of ELLs. The ESL teacher and ELA department work closely to insure that ELLs are exposed to the balanced literacy 
format and are adequately prepared for the ELA exam.  Regular ELA and Math teachers often lead ELLs in the SES sponsored

after school reading and math enrichment programs. The certified ESL teachers are given ample time to consult with content 
area instructors on how they can best meet the needs of the 6th graders who enter and 8th graders, who need extra help to 
prepare for high school. On the first day of the school year for teachers, there is plethora professional development led by 
Jacklyn Kalaydjian and Alma Ortiz concerning differentiation for ELLs.  This in house professional development supports the 
guidance counselor and suject area teachers. It is centered around multiple entry points and using manipulatives to promote 
student development.  Election day, provides Jacklyn Kalaydjian with time to provide PD to each grade team concerning how 
to make content instruction accessable for ELLs. Every Thursday, inquiry groups of teachers of ELLs meet to discuss pedagogy. 
During 6th grade meetings, the ESL teacher, Jacklyn Kalaydjian, provides feeback and guidance in scaffolding methodology. 
Assistant Principals regularly engage in these meetings. The staff (teachers and parent coordinators) are supported by school 
leadership and the guidance counselor.  Some activities include after school academic Reading and Math, peer tutoring, and 
parent workshops.  
The pupil accounting secretary, Loraine, often meets with Jacklyn Kalaydjian  to discuss new admit procedures and the use of 
ATS for placement and identification. 
When Jacklyn Kalaydjian meets with her colleagues, she records it in her Professional Development through Collaboration log 
in her notebook. She includes, the date, the people meeting, the subject and notes. These records are maintained on file, kept 
in a cabinet, locked. Some records are computerized.   
 There will be highly effective professional development plans in effect for all ELL personnel at the school.  Our school will 
provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English language 
learners.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by 
CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language 
teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to language 
acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  All agendas and attendace data will be recorded 
and kept in a bInder in Mrs. kalaydjian's Room.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, langauge development 
progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Mrs. Kalaydjian or 
any other qualified staff will set up meetings with parents either face-to-face or phone conference. Each parent has a different 
schedule,  so we try to accommodate parents in any way possible. First, we send home parent letters asking parents to fill out 
a form, which requires them to pick a day and time that works best for them. Then we conduct the meeting. If parent or 
guardian can not make time to come in, then we ask that theyprovide a number and time we can best reach them. We then 
proceed to have a conference call for their convenience.  Translation services are available for every parent. If the parent 
speaks Spanish, Mrs. Kalaydjian asks that the parent coordinator be present for translation services. If the parent speaks 
Chinese, Mrs. Kalaydjian asks the Mrs. Lee is present for translation purposes. If there is a parent that speaks another language 
beside Spanish or Chinese, then Mrs. Kalaydjian uses the Translation and Interpretation Services Affiliation.    

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents are always welcome to visit the school and do so often. Our Spanish speaking parent coordinator, Ana Berroa, leads a 
series of workshops and classes each year for ELL and EP parents. Our parent coordinator assists parents with guidance, 
interprets materials, distributes dictionaries, makes phone calls home and assists parent with any surveys (ie HLIS). The Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) is also very involved in creating workshops and makes a special effort to invite ELL parents to 
meetings. All PTA meeting announcements have Spanish translations on the back. A Polish speaker is present at every meeting

to provide translation. The Parent Action Committee meets one time per month with school leadership to assess current policy 
and make suggestions. Spanish translated questionairres are routinely sent to families to evaluate their needs. As mandated, 
all parents of new ELLs receive an orientation to provide them with the information necessary to make informed educational 
choices for their child.  There are other translation services such as Polish, Spanish and Cantonese.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Leander Windley, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

All parents/guardians of new entrants to the NYC public school system are required to complete a home language 
survey to determine their child’s eligibility for English language services. While the survey is ultimately used to 
provide direction for instructional choices, the surveys are an excellent indicator of what language(s) the 
parents/guardians communicate in. Our school also keeps various biographical reports on all students that include 
information on home country and home language. A more informal methodology used to measure the school’s 
written and oral interpretation needs is when our homeroom teachers ask the students’ to complete a 
questionnaire and complete contact information cards that include the question, “What languages are spoken at 
home?” Too often the assumption is made that only parents/guardians of ELLs do not communicate in English. 
However, we have found that over 60% of our student population speaks a language other than English at home. 
Lastly, a needs based survey for translation is rendered incomplete without a review of what languages staff hold 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74 

 

oral and written proficiency in. Thus, at the beginning of the school year all staff will complete a brief 
questionnaire asking what languages they are able to communicate in orally and/or written and to approximate 
proficiency level. Follow-up questions include to list any previous translation experiences and if they would be 
willing to volunteer for either written or oral translation services at school. Our school determines the primary 
language spoken by each parent throught the home language survey. We record this information on emergency 
cards, and through ATS.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

 

I.S. 318 teachers individually meet with 
parents or guardians of students at least 
once a year; in addition to three parent-
teacher conferences (in which parents 
come to discuss student 
growth/progress/behavior), initial parent 
orientations, and quarterly progress 
meetings. All teachers are required to have 
Monday morning meeting with parents. 
The meetings could be face-to-face, phone 
conferences, and email communication 
regarding student behavior/academic 
progress. Teachers and parents discuss 
goals of the program, their child's language 
cdevelopment progress, their child's English 
lasnguage proficiency assessment results, 
and language development needs in all 
content areas. Teachers are mandated to 
update parents through Jupiter Grades, a 
program our school uses to track student's 
progress throughout each quarter. This 
allows parents to switch languages to 
prefered languages.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school’s oral translation needs are sufficient for Spanish and Polish speaking families. Our most pressing language 
population in need of oral translation services are Mandarin speaking populations. Oral translations are necessary 
during regular school hours and during special events such as conferences, open houses and meetings held by Deans 
regarding behavior issues. The school will use the resources and knowledge of staff first, followed by parental 
volunteers. However, for Arabic translations outside vendors will be needed.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Throughtout the school year during quarterly meetings, there will be a parent survey that needs o be filled. Each 
teacher will have the survey and will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services.
