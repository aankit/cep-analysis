Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

PS 150’s mission is to have all of our students achieve at their highest level and potential by providing individualized 
instruction in a safe and nurturing environment. We also strive to develop students' awareness and respect for 
cultural diversity. It is important for our students to give back to the community. Therefore, every grade is involved in 
service projects where they raise awareness, collect resources and money to give to designated organizations.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our school is located in a diverse community. It has an annex which houses our pre-kindergarten and kindergarten 
classrooms. We educate pre-K through 6th grade students from a variety of countries and linguistic backgrounds. 
Some of our students are new immigrants and first-generation Americans. The average attendance rate is 97%. 

PS 150Q is a high performing Title I school who has maintained good standing throughout the years. 

We offer a variety of programs, such as monolingual classes in grades pre-K through sixth, one talented and gifted 
class per grade in Kindergarten through fifth grade, seven self-contained ESL classes- two in Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd

We also have one dual language class in grade Kindergarten through 5th grade. We have an integrated team teaching 
class in each grade. There are four self-contained classes – k, 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6. Additionally, there is a full-time and 
part-time ENL teacher providing in-class services to mandated ENL students. Qualified students receive a variety of 
support services, such as response to intervention, academic intervention, SETTS, speech, physical and occupational 
therapy, mandated and preventive counseling, ENL after school program and Project Intervention and Saturday 
Academy. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Challenges: 

Student Achievement: 

  ELA continues to be an area of focus, especially for ENL and SE students. 
  Our lowest 1/3 is higher for ELA in all grades. 
  On the state test for ELA, we notice that our lowest subgroup continues to be ENL and special education. 
  On similar skills, our students are doing better in the written portion of the test. 

Supportive Environment: 

  We need to continue to provide our students with learning activities that address language and vocabulary 
acquisition for all learners. We need to continue to work on rigorous and differentiated learning activities. 

  We need to make the reading-writing connection. 
  We also need to address main idea and inferencing, so our students can move into interpretation. 
  Although we saw growth in writing on our NYSESLAT, our ENL students continue to under perform in this 

area.  
 

 

Collaboration: 

  On the quality review, our area of focus is continuity of instruction across classes. 

In order to have continuity and consistency of practices, teachers need to continue to plan units and lessons 
collaboratively. We will continue to

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

  Our ELA proficiency levels went up for both literacy (level 3 & 4 is 67.1% and math. 
  Our students are engaged in conversations. We will continue to push our students to articulate their thinking 

and justify their answers with text evidence and examples. 

  As a result of language prompts and sentence frames, the students’ conversations have become stronger. 

 

Needs: 

  According to our data, Grade 5 had a decline in ELA. They went from 59.5 to 54.8. They are the lowest 

performing grade. 

  Our lowest one third continues to be Students with Disabilities and English language learners. 
  When we look at the item analysis, our students continue to have difficulty with language and vocabulary. 

Therefore, we will make vocabulary which is a practice from Advance Literacy our instructional focus. 

  All inquiry teams will be related to vocabulary acquisition. The ENL teachers will also focus on a combination 

of vocabulary and writing. 

  Our SE students seem to need additional support in math.  



priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all classes will work on main idea and inferencing that target specific reading comprehension skills. We 
will use the running records and Teacher's College reading progression to assess and expect to see a one to two-level 
increase in our June comprehension assessments.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS150Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

PS 150Q’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of PS 150Q. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance PS 150Q's Title I program. This information will be maintained by  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 150Q will support parents and families of all students in:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

P.S. 150Q will offer a Title III after school program for ENLs beginning on October 18th, 2018 
and ending on _January 30, 2019. The program will meet for 2 hours on Wednesdays and 
Thursdays from 2:45 to 4:45 for 14 weeks. The NYSESLAT results, AMAO Data and the ELA 
assessments were used to determine the needs of the English Language Learners  for 
instructional  planning and the selection of materials for  PS 150Q ENL After School Program. 
2018-2019 AMAO Data, NYSESLAT performance and ELA test scores were analyzed and it 
was determined that the focus for support must be on literacy and academic language. The 
program will be offered to ENL students in grades K-6 who are entering, emergent, and 
transitioning . The purpose of the program is to increase and enhance the academic skills 
of  ELLs with explicit emphasis on language development and vocabulary. K-6. Students will be 
grouped based on their grade band and language proficiency. There will be 5 classes in total. The 
program will serve around 100  ELLs in Kindergarten to 6th grade. We will have 
one kindergarten,  one 1st  one 2nd grade s, one 3rd &t one 4th,5th & 6th grade newcomers 
class. Class size will be around 15-20 students. 5 ENL and Bilingual certified teachers 1 content 
area teacher will be provide instruction in English. Pre, mid and post assessments will be given 
to monitor student progress and needs.  Teachers will meet 3 times throughout the duration of the 
ENL after school program in which they will be planning, looking at student work and sharing 
best practices.  Language Power K-6 series created by Teacher Created Materials will be used for 
instruction.  Academic vocabulary, reading and writing and language development will be the 
focus of the after school program. The instruction is differentiated by design in which leveled 
texts, visuals, sentence frames for complex academic language, graphic organizers, incorporation 
of multiple modalities, audio CDs are some of the many scaffolds teacher will utilize. ENL After 
Schools at PS 150Q also aims to equip ENLs with literacy skills that will help them meet the 
expectations for NYSESLAT.  To enrich the program students will have a 45 minute session per 
week in the computer lab where they can utilize literacy websites such as I-ready. Students will 
be able to use iready at home. Teachers will have time to plan.  Planning time will not come 
from Title 111 funds.  Attendance and student data will be kept in a folder.  Teachers will 
regularly use the information to make changes to their lessons and to target areas that need to be 
strengthened.  We expect to see progress with language acquistion and reading and writing 
skills.  The impacted of this work will be noted in the 2019 NYSESLAT results.

The rationale for the Professional Development for this year will continue to be around best ENL 
practices for the teachers who will be working in the Title III program.The Professional 
Development meetings will take place four times between Nov. 11th, 2018 and ending on 
_Jan.  14th , 2019 for half hour intervals. PD will be provided by the following administrators, 
Zulma Tanzer and  the ENL teacher Ms. Ucar on Mondays during Professional Development 
block. The teachers will  also meet to plan instruction that is aligned to our ELLs language needs 
and data during  Tuesdays will also be used for this purpose.  Teachers need help in 
understanding strategies that benefit these subgroups.  Also they can learn how to 
effectively write language goals and incorporate Common Core Language , Listening and 
Speaking Standards in their planning as a way of tracking and monitoring progress towards 
language development. 
 
Teachers will receive workshops in the following topics: 
How to use ENL progressions for differentiation for ELLs at various levels of Language 
proficiency. 
How to  use targets of measurement to incorporate  NYSESLAT expectations in daily instruction 
throughout the year. 
How to look at student writing using the NYSESLAT rubrics. 
how to Scaffold for Academic Writing/ Reading for ELLs. 
Best Routines, practices to develop academic vocabulary and language. 
ENL teachers will turn-key best practices to the rest of the staff on Monday professional 
development.  We are also sending ENL and general education teachers to ENL workshops.  The 
information and resources that they receive is also given to other teachers.  As a Teacher's 
College school, we have links for ENL supports and resources which have been shared with all 
teachers. 
 
Please note:  Teacher planning and PD  sessions are at no cost to the program.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In order to guide instructional planning for ELLs at P.S. 150Q, we use several assessments. NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results are 
used to determine the English proficiency levels of ELLs so that the instruction is planned for English as a New Language. 
Instruction is geared to develop English Language proficiency through standalone ENL and integrated ENL  based on the 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT performance levels. The data from NYSESLAT shows that our ELLs are more proficient in speaking and 
listening, however, it is more social based than academic based.  NYSESLAT scores demonstrate that reading and writing are 
the areas that need improvement.  The instruction in reading and writing is linked to content as a way of promoting language 
skill in English.  This is carefully planned. This data also helps us create an instructional plan that targets the use of language 
goals. ENL supports/strategies visual cues and prompts used to support the as well as ESSA Next Generation Learning 
Standards for Language. For Spanish speaking ELLs, the results of Spanish Lab informs the decisions for planning and 
instruction. We use Spanish literacy level as a resource to build on, scaffold and differentiate for instructional purposes. We 
also use I-Ready Computer Program assessments in order to diagnose ELLs reading, phonics and vocabulary needs. I-ready 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

assessments inform the instructional planning about the areas that need to be taught or reinforced. Small guided group 
instruction is also planned for ELLs with similar needs. It also allows a close tracking of ELL progress. Fountas and Pinnell 
Running Records are also used throughout the year for multiple instructional decisions. Depending on Fountas and Pinnell 
Running Records results mini-lessons that will the strengthen reading and writing skills are designed. All the information from 
these tests is used to differentiate and scaffold lessons. Teachers form small groups and provide additional support to meet 
students' learning needs. Teachers also use the information to create baselines and monitor student progress and educational 
gains throughout the school year. Baseline test and end of unit tests are also used to make changes to the existing curriculum 
maps and lesson plans in order to differentiate and scaffold lessons for ELLs. In addition, the I-Ready computer program is 
used to assess individual students’ Lexile levels in reading and monitor it throughout the school year. The teacher will then use 
this data to guide instruction. In the early grades, teachers use Fountas and Pinnell, teacher created assessments, performance 
tasks to assess reading behaviors, early literacy skills and for concepts of print. We have seen that ELLs at Entering and 
Emerging English proficiency levels need more support in terms of concepts of print and phonics. Students at transitioning and 
expanding levels of English Language proficiency have basic letter/sound relationship awareness and sight word knowledge 
and they need to build on their reading and writing skills. These assessment results are taken into consideration for small 
group and individual instructional decisions. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to plan to meet the needs of ELLs, several established structures are in place at PS 150Q. Firstly, grade teams meet 
regularly to plan before the school year starts, during the year, as well as at the end of the year. Planning periods and grade 
meetings are built in teachers schedules. Teachers of ELLs and administrators are always present in these meetings. The results 
of NYSITELL and NYSESLAT  and Spanish Lab are shared and looked at during team meetings for planning purposes at the 
beginning of the school year to ensure that the instruction is differentiated and scaffolded for ELLs at different levels of 
language proficiency. Ongoing professional development sessions both in-house and outside provide opportunities for all 
parties involved teaching ELLs to explore resources for a well-planned instruction. Teachers of ELLs also participate in 
Professional Development Sessions in which they discuss the results of these assessments and incorporate and plan scaffolds 
for instruction.  Also, at P.S. 150Q  inquiry meetings contribute to planning instruction for ELLs. During these inquiry sessions, 
teachers of ELLs get together to further discuss ways to utilize data from formative assessments to inform instructional 
planning. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At P.S. 150Q we use several assessments to identify ELLs’ baseline, progress and areas of need. In all grades K-6, at the 
beginning of a new unit, a baseline assessment (an on demand exam and/or pre-test) is administered and the the results are 
discussed and areas of need are diagnosed. Based on the areas of need, teachers make adjustments to their lesson plans. 
Student progress is monitored through mid unit checks, or benchmarks. An end of unit test or a task or a project is completed 
and scored when the unit of study is complete. Another resource we use to identify baseline, progress and areas of need for 
ELLs are  I-Ready assessments. All ELLs at P.S. 150Q have access to these resources for ELA. The built-in baseline assessments 
determine an ELL’s level for reading, phonics and vocabulary and the program is customized based on the ELL’s performance. 
Both teachers and parents have access to the student’s performance reports.To identify baseline, progress and areas of need 
for ELLs in math, we use unit tests, performance series and math fluency tasks. Also ELLs in K-6 complete 4 math tasks 
throughout the school year.  All these assessments help to identify where an ELL starts in a certain subject in math and 
monitor their progress and identify areas of need. In Grades K-2 students complete a performance task in Math and ELA at the 
beginning of the school year and at the end of the school year to measure progress. Fountas and Pinnell running records are 
also another assessment we use to determine an ELL’s reading skills.  When an ELL is admitted, we administer Fountas and 
Pinnell running records in English and in Spanish for Spanish speaking ELLs to determine their reading levels. In lower grades, 
we administer assessments for concepts of print and reading readiness to determine the reading levels. Students’ reading 
comprehension skills are continuously monitored throughout the year through these running records and assessments. Miscue 
analysis for comprehension strategies, fluency and decoding are used to identify areas of need and inform guided reading 
groups and instruction. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Common planning periods are when classroom teachers and ENL teachers use the results from summative assessments to 
decide on what kind of interventions can be provided to ELLs. During these planning periods ELLs are grouped by their areas of 
need after the summative data has been gathered. Small groups are formed for guided reading, writing or math. Based on 
these results, mini lessons are planned to meet the needs of ELLs. Classroom teachers, ENL teachers and other service 
providers share this data to plan their small group instruction. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At P.S. 150Q, in order to provide the necessary interventions we use several sources of data and also look at various indicators. 
We first examine achievement at class level. We make sure that there is a strong instructional core taking place in the 
classroom at TIER 1 level.  We ensure that instructional aims develop different key domains of literacy by supporting 
competencies in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. We also make sure that instruction makes direct and appropriate 
connections to ELLs' community values, identities, and languages.  We gather data from multiple sources. First, we look at data 
from both summative and formative assessments.  We also assess literacy in the Home Language and interview the parents. 
We also review past records to gather more information about the learner. We measure an ELLs' progress through the lens of 
language acquisition based the child’s English language proficiency. With all the data at hand we design and implement all the 
scaffolds and supplemental activities. Student progress is monitored over time to see if  ELLs are making gains, and 
adjustments are made throughout.  Intensive small group interventions are provided to ELLs based on their progress. We use 
Fountas and Pinnell LLI program for struggling readers and writers. If a child struggles persistently despite different 
supplemental approaches a formal evaluation for additional services is requested. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use the EDAT (AMAO tool) to inform ELL programs at our school. We also utilize data from the NYSESLAT and the State test 
for ELA and Math. We use NYSESLAT results for several purposes. Firstly, NYSESLAT results determine the number of minutes 
of ENL services and service type. ELLs continue to receive ENL services based on their English proficiency levels on NYSESLAT. 
Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL services per week.. Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of standalone 
ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL through ELA. Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 90 minutes 
integrated ENL and 90 minutes ENL through content areas per week.. Transitioning ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL: 90 minutes of which is through ELA and 90 minutes is through content areas. Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL through ELA or content areas. Proficient and Commanding ELLs  continue to receive 90 minutes of ENL through 
content areas. Data from the NYSESLAT is used also to inform instruction. At P.S. 150Q, the NYSESLAT data shows that  ELLs 
perform higher on Speaking than Listening, Reading and Writing, so teachers of ELLs plan accordingly to develop different key 
domains of literacy, to support competencies in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Developing speaking, listening 
,reading and writing through different academic content areas has been an instructional  focus at PS 150Q. Teachers 
plan standalone ENL and integrated ENL through ELA, science and social studies lessons that foster the development of 
language acquisition. State test scores for ELA and Math State test scores also inform the teachers of ELLs about how to group 
ELLs depending on their needs. Previous test scores showed that ELLs struggle writing extended responses, so small group 
instruction for ELLs have been put in place for 5th and 6th grade ELLs in order to help them develop this skill.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Test scores of NYSESLAT, State test for ELA and Math are disseminated with all parties that are involved in ELLs’ education. 
NYSESLAT parent letters are sent home in order to inform parents about their children’s English Language Proficiency Levels 
and how they performed at each modality at beginning of the school year. The results of tests are shared through grade 
meetings, planning periods,and  inquiry.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

A. Freestanding ENL program: At PS 150Q ELLs in Kindergarten, 1st , 2nd, 3rd , 4th  receive services in self contained 
ENL through their ENL licensed classroom teachers. ELLs are grouped by mixed proficiency levels in these self 
contained classes. ELLs who are not in a self contained ENL classroom are both serviced through pull out, push in and 
integrated ENL.  ELLs in 5th and 6th grade classrooms receive ENL services through integrated ENL through ELA when 
an ENL teacher pushes in. Also, Entering, Emerging, Transitional students receive mandated standalone ENL minutes 
through pull out or push in. 
b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:  N/A  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 P.S. 150Q offers Spanish-English Dual Language program K-5. ELLs are  heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels) 
grouped in their self contained Dual Language classes per grade.  Language of Instruction alternates for each day of 
the week as English or Spanish.  ELLs receive ENL and HLA services through their bilingual licensed classroom teachers. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

P.S.150Q follows the CR Part 154 Requirements for English as a New Language Grades K-8 to ensure that ELLs receive their 
mandated minutes. We program these minutes on Stars and closely monitor EDUR report to make adjustments.   
a. We use NYSITELL (for new ELLs) and NYSESLAT scores to determine the number of minutes of ENL services and service type. 
Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL services. Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 
minutes of integrated ENL through ELA. Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 90 minutes integrated ENL and 
90 minutes ENL through content areas. Transitioning ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL  90 minutes of which is 
through ELA and 90 minutes is through content areas. Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL through ELA 
or  content areas. Proficient and Commanding ELLs continue to receive 90 minutes of ENL through content areas.  
 
Bilingual certified classroom teachers offer HLA in Spanish through content area subjects. Since we follow the alternating day 
schedule, we exceed the mandated 1 unit of HLA class and 2 units of Bilingual content area subject instruction.  Students learn 
to read and write and receive instruction in other disciplines in both languages, Spanish and English.  For emergent literacy, 
extra time is dedicated to the rules and concepts of each language. Students receive dedicated reading time in each language. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In freestanding ENL program core content is delivered in English. In Dual language core content is delivered in Spanish and 
English. In order to make content comprehensible to foster the language development and meet the demands of the 
ESSA Next Generation Learning Standards, we use a wealth of instructional methods and approaches. At P.S. 150Q we use a 
balanced literacy approach in which students learn though highly engaging content areas where there is strong emphasis on all 
components of language : listening, speaking, reading, writing, as well as academic vocabulary.  One of the best practices we 
implement in our ELL classes is planning lessons with clear language goals. We communicate these language goals to the 
students in a child friendly language. P.S. 150Q follows ESSA Next Generation Learning Standards for Language  to design 
language lessons and make sure we teach towards these goals. We explicitly teach key vocabulary, academic vocabulary that 
the unit demands. We also design and teach lessons that help students develop language forms and functions that will foster 
their language development. Another approach we have at P.S. 150Q is front loading the lesson where we help students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

activate prior language and build background by previewing, setting a purpose for reading or writing, listening or speaking. We 
make sure students make connections between the lesson and their lives. We provide comprehensible input through visuals, 
graphics, organizers such as thinking maps, as well as audio and textual summaries in English and native language. Technology 
is also used inside and outside the classroom. ELLs have access to I-Ready accounts where they practice further at home. We 
strongly believe in modelling and hands on learning experiences such as projects, end of unit cumulative tasks as well as field 
trips. Students are given ample opportunities to practice all components of language through engaging academic contents in 
pairs or groups. We utilize different strategies for grouping of students based on their proficiency levels. In order to lower 
affective filter especially for ELLs at lower proficiency levels, teachers provide enough wait time and create a classroom 
environment where students feel safe and comfortable.  We differentiate tasks both for Math and ELA utilizing the 
performance level descriptions that are available on Engage NY. Teachers of ELLs also use Targets of measurement for for 
planning purposes to meet the demands of the Next Generation Learning Standards under ESSA. We monitor progress and 
provide re-teaching and intervention when necessary. Students are provided task specific rubrics and checklists to help them 
assess their progress and guide them toward their goals. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Home language is assessed through SPANISH LAB, ELE and Fountas and Pinnell Running Records in Spanish for Spanish 
speakers.  Students also take unit tests and complete tasks that are in Spanish in Dual Language programs. Home language 
support is provided through the ENL program model and in Dual Language classrooms through the use of books and websites 
offered through our computers. Our school classroom libraries also have a variety of books that students can borrow and read, 
some in their home language. Translated tests and translators are offered to students for the New York State content area 
exams.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) At P.S. 150-Q there are currently no students identified as SIFE.  
b) ELL students who are considered to be newcomers get differentiated instruction with a strong emphasis on methodologies 
to increase BICS and CALP vocabulary, spelling, phonological skills, grammar, and critical thinking skills. They also have access 
to ENL based technology. This includes online website at I-Ready, Starfall, ABC Learning,  Teachers utilize Performance level 
descriptors in order to differentiate  and scaffold for newcomer ELLs. 
c) For developing ELLs, we enhance language development using various ENL strategies such as scaffolding prior knowledge of 
a specific content area, modeling, the use of manipulatives, graphic organizers,pictures, multi-leveled books on tape/CD, 
guided reading, vocabulary building, and reading comprehension. Small group instruction is also used within the classroom 
during the school day. Instruction is geared toward skills and strategies that will build on literacy skills, such as inferring, main 
idea, and cause and effect. I-Ready, a web-based program that addresses listening, and reading skills is used with the students 
during teacher-specified ENL periods.  
d) For Long term ELLs, We analyze the NYSESLAT performance score to see their areas of need and target to improve those 
skills. At P.S. 150Q, reading and writing are the skills where students struggle to reach commanding level. Therefore, academic 
reading and writing is the focus for long term ELLs.  Teachers of long term ELLs are informed about the areas of need for long 
terms ELLs and small group instruction is planned accordingly. Students receive one-on-one conferencing and guided 
instruction in the classroom. Students are provided a set activities aligned with the individual needs of each student. These 
lessons built around targets of measurement and New Generation Learning Standards under ESSA help students become more 
proficient readers and writers. Lessons are based on the New Learning Standards for English as a New Language and ENL 
students are invited to participate in all academic interventions available in our school.  
e) Commanding students are serviced by ENL teachers for 90 minutes a week as per the CR-Part 154.2. They will have direct 
instruction activities to support language development. They are also offered the opportunity to participate in the Title III 
Program for ENLs. They are invited to partake in any of the activities offered to ELLs. Monitoring of their progress and 
providing the monolingual teachers with support through professional development opportunities will also help these 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

students as they continue learning English in a supportive environment. All former ELLs who achieved a level of proficiency 
within the last two years receive the same testing modifications as continuing ELLs. They are also invited to attend ELA and 
Math After School Programs. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To provide access to academic content areas and accelerate language development teachers of ELL-SWDs utilize a variety of 
strategies and grade level materials. Teachers of  ELL-SWDs use Fountas and Pinnell Intervention kits in order to help students 
to improve their reading, writing and phonics skills, in small group or one-on one. These classrooms also have libraries that 
have multileveled, high interest books. ELL-SWDs have access to I-ready computer program that aims to further help reading 
comprehension, phonics and vocabulary. Students can access this program at school and at home. Teachers of ELL-SWD also 
implement a variety of best teaching strategies that will foster language development and teach content. All lessons are 
planned with clear language goals. These strategies include: checking for understanding, paraphrasing, repeating 
and  clarifying when necessary. Also, Front loading the lesson to activate and build prior knowledge and to make connections. 
In order to provide comprehensible input (I+1), graphic organizers, thinking maps and visuals are also utilized. Students are 
given ample opportunities in which they produce language through reading, writing, listening and speaking as well as 
vocabulary. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
P.S. 150Q  has ELL students with special needs in self-contained 12:1classes and in I.C.T (Integrated Co-teaching) settings. 
Programming at our school ensures that ELL-SWDs experience maximum time spent with general education peers. All students 
participate in school- wide events together and common grades attend class trips together. All students are invited to join in 
activities and perform in shows together, such as School Musical Performances and/or  School Chorus. 
Also, Service providers and  ENL teachers communicate with one another in order to make sure that ELL-SWDs receive their 
mandated ENL minutes. Scheduling is done so that services do not overlap. ENL teacher pushes in during the ELA periods to 
provide the mandated minutes. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention Services for ELLs throughout the school year focus on each ELL’s specific areas of strengths and weaknesses. The 
information for targeting the student’s strengths and weaknesses are found on Skedula, state ELA scores, state math scores, 
the NYSESLAT, and in class, ongoing pre and post assessments. Teachers keep individual student portfolios with unit test 
scores, final projects, samples of student work as well as any other forms of intervention that the student has participated in. 
This includes communication with parents and any other staff members who are involved in the students’ academic success. 
These interventions include: Small Group Instruction or conferencing , Individual Conferencing, Scaffolded and differentiated 
activities.  We also offer RTI Tier II and III services to at risk students for ELA. Students who are not responding to TIER I 
interventions are pulled out by an RTI teacher to help them improve their reading and writing skills. ELLs in general education 
classes who are below the grade reading levels and who are struggling writers are serviced by an RTI teacher in a pull out 
group. Also, we offer an after school intervention program for newcomer  ELLs and struggling ELLs in order to give them 
opportunities to make progress. During the summer, ELLs are offered a summer enrichment program that targets language 
development both academically and socially.  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Data and trends showed that newcomer ELLs need instruction in small, intensive groups where language development is the 
focus. So, for next year, we will establish a small, intensive pull-out group for newcomers ELLs.  Also, our long-terms ELLs are 
stuck at the Expanding level. Writing is an area where they need to improve in order to reach Commanding level on NYSESLAT. 
Therefore, we are planning to form small group instruction where writing is the focus.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

  N/A  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ENL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. ENL students are invited to participate in all after-school 
programs offered, such as Sunnyside, Virtual Y, Serious Fun, Title III. ENL students are included in every school program, 
including Art, Computers, Music, Chorus, and Drama. This is ensured by every class being scheduled equally on the school’s 
daily schedule. Every class also has the opportunity to participate in every school activity and special event equally. Some of 
these activities include a school play, school chorus, Carnival or Movie Night, Art Night, Dual Language Show, School Dance, 
school trips to Washington D.C., Philidelphia or Boston to name a few. If any ENL student should require Speech, SETTS, Special 
Education, Occupational Therapy or Physical Therapy, the service is offered and provided to them as required.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ENL students participate in interactive computer-based instructional programs using various forms of technology such 
as  Smart Boards and Elmos in their classrooms, as well as Mac computers in the Computer lab. Students also get individual 
access to use technology through I-Pads and Mac Laptops. They can access I-Ready as well as research information and view 
informational videos on the Internet. By way of I-Ready student progress is tracked and the program adjusts Lexile level 
according to student strengths and weaknesses.  We also use ESSA Next Generation Learning Standards and Reader’s and 
Writer’s workshop model. Teacher generated materials such as charts and graphs provide a print rich classroom environment. 
Leveled classroom libraries help all students. The mini-lessons, Learning Objectives and Language Objectives and 
feedback address student needs. In writer’s workshop, students use journals, source books, note taking, charts and post-it 
notes for note-taking. Students produce writing pieces and edit their stories through the writing process using task specific 
rubrics and checklists.  Small group instruction is used to give the students more opportunity to interact with the reading 
process. It also provides focus and interest to struggling students. The students are engaged in shared reading, guided reading, 
independent reading, accountable talk as well as developing language experiences. Instruction is geared toward skills and 
strategies which will build literacy, such as inferring, main idea, and cause and effect. We enhance reading development using 
various ENL strategies such as scaffolding, vocabulary building, and reading comprehension.  Appropriate leveled classroom 
libraries in English and native languages are available to support instruction. Presently, we are planning to build on the native 
language books available to students both in the classroom as well as the school library. Teachers in  Dual Language and ENL 
programs use a balanced literacy approach while employing ENL strategies and methodologies such as Total Physical Response 
(TPR), use of visual aids, and the above mentioned appropriate leveled classroom libraries. Teachers throughout the grades 
use multiple assessments to determine where students need support. Running records, conference notes and  data collection 
are used consistently to monitor students’ progress.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language is assessed through SPANISH LAB, ELE and Fountas and Pinnell Running Records in Spanish for Spanish 
speakers.  Students also take unit tests and complete tasks that are in Spanish in Dual Language programs. Home language 
support is provided through the ENL program model and in Dual Language classrooms through the use of books and websites 
offered through our computers. Our school classroom libraries also have a variety of books that students can borrow and read, 
some in their home language. Translated tests and translators are offered to students for the New York State content area 
exams. New students are also paired up with a buddy that speaks their home language to give them social support, which in 
turn makes them more comfortable academically. Applications such as google translate is used in the classroom for ELLs who 
are newcomers or at early levels of language proficiency. Letters home are translated in the majority home language (Spanish). 
The parent coordinator has I-Speak cards by his office so we can provide parents appropriate translators. We also use 
translation funds to hire outside translators to translate for the State tests or special occasions. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support, and all resources correspond to ENLs’ ages and grade levels appropriately. All books purchased 
and provided are appropriate for all students' age levels. When a student participates in any program, all activities are age and

grade-level appropriate. Title III materials were also previously purchased for each grade level and used according to grade 
level. All library books used in the classroom for all subject areas are grade appropriate for all ENL students.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Activities for new ENLs who enroll throughout the school year include an orientation with their grade appropriate guidance 
counselor to show the students and their parents around the school. We also try to place students with buddies to help them 
acclimate to the new school environment. The parent coordinator stays in close contact with the new ELL family to help them 
orient to the school. If the students speak little or no English, we  pair them up with students who speak their language. All 
newcomer ELLs are also invited to after school programs and ELL summer school program. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We use an alternating-day model in our dual language classes. With 100% of instruction is given in English 
one day and the following day, 100% of instruction is given in Spanish. Each language is taught through 
the content areas, as well as through literacy. For emergent literacy, extra time is dedicated to the rules 
and concepts of each language. Students receive time that is solely dedicated to reading in each 
language. Since the classroom teacher with a bilingual license instructs in all content areas, they have 
been trained to embed ENL strategies in all lessons.  
b) All content area ELA (Reading & Writing), Word Work, Math, Science, Social Studies are taught in both 
English and Spanish on alternate days.  
c) We use an alternating-day model in our dual language classes. 100% of instruction is given in English 
one day, then the following day, 100% of instruction is given in Spanish. Each language is taught through 
the content areas, as well as through literacy. For emergent literacy, extra time is dedicated to the rules 
and concepts of each language. Students receive time that is solely dedicated to reading in each 
language. Since the classroom teacher instructs in all content areas they have been trained to embed ENL 
strategies in all lessons.  
d) Both languages are taught simultaneously as stated above. Sample student schedule: ELA (reading & 
writing), Word Work, Math, Science, Social Studies, Read-A-Loud, Interactive Writing, Guided Reading.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff members are offered  various workshops during the course of the year, including Monday afternoons, Election Day, 
Brooklyn Queens Day and other times throughout the year. Teachers of ELLs and pedagogical staff are offered a variety of 
opportunities for professional development. PS 150Q  teachers benefit from the PDs offered at the Queens District 30 office of 
ELLs. We regularly register Teachers of ELLs and pedagogical staff to attend PD to learn about best practices.  We also regularly 
disseminate the NYC  Department of Education Division of English Language Learners and Student Support Office of ELLs News 
and Opportunities. Teachers are also offered opportunities to attend at Fordham R-BERN and NYU R-Bern for ELL related 
Professional Development. ELL Personnel also attend PD on Mondays during PD period at PS150Q. Some of the Professional 
sessions offered were ‘How to incorporate TOMs and Performance Descriptors when planning for ELLs’, ‘Best Practices to 
Scaffold and Differentiate for ELLs’, ‘Using Thinking Maps for Comprehensible Input for ELLs’, ‘Utilizing Common Core Learning 
Standards for Language in ELL classrooms’, ‘Differentiating for the Classroom Teacher with ELL’s’, ‘How to get ready for 
NYSESLAT’. They also receive training during the school day in the form of Inter- visitations. Staff members continue to attend 
workshops offered by the UFT as well. We can find these PDs in the UFT newspaper.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
For all PDs, we have a sign in sheet which is filed in a central location in the school’s office. Teachers are also given agendas of 
the PDs where they are asked to keep a copy for their PD hours. Information is disseminated during grade meetings and PD 
sessions that 15% total hours of PD for all teaches and 50% of total hours of PD for bilingual education and for ENL teachers 
have to be in ELL specific professional development. Teachers are offered PD (at school or outside school) based on this 
requirement. School Administrators keep a record of all teachers attending PDs. 
  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During Individual meetings with parents of ELLs. During these meetings, we aim to discuss goals of the program where an ELL is 
placed. We inform  parents of ELLs' language development progress. Language proficiency assessment results such 
as  NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments are shared with the parents. We inform  parents how 
they can help their children with language development needs in content areas. We also utilize TOMs in order to create an 
informational handout to be shared with the parents to highlight the expectations for every grade in ELA. These documents 
are translated in to Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Bengali. Translators are available at these meetings for all parents who 
request them.   
  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are involved in the school in many ways. There are many workshops for parents. All parents are invited to these 
workshops, including parents of ELLs. Letters are sent home whenever possible in the native language of the parent. 
Translators are available at the workshops for parents who request them. Workshops are given for the parents to keep them 
informed. Some of the workshops given include information on State testing: ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT. There is also a 
workshop for science and the science fair. Parents are invited to visit their child's classroom and participate in 
learning activities during Parents as Learning Partners on the first Friday of each month. Classroom teachers invite parents to

attend class publishing parties upon completion of a unit to celebrate their children's accomplishments in writing. There is also 
‘Bear Night’ where students and their parents share literature activities There is open communication between administration 
and parents so the needs of parents can be evaluated and addressed. Keeping parents informed about events, tests, and other 
activities in the school keeps them involved in their child's education and learning.  The parent Coordinator is the point person 
who helps to organize parent outreach, Parent workshops, community activities, etc. He reaches out through regular 
meetings, Questionnaires, Calendar of events, parent notifications and an open door policy. He is the one who maintains 
records of all parental activities in the school. P.S. 150Q offers an after school program for ELLs, especially new immigrant 
families where parents are also invited to attend with their child. This is a great opportunity to foster learning as a whole 
family. This also helps some parents to learn more English along side their children.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carmen Parache, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 150Q uses the School Level Emergency Contact Student List, School written and Oral communication form, 
the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to identify and access the language preferences of the parents in 
our school community. Using this data, we have identified such languages as: Chinese, Mandarin Chinese, 
Spanish, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, and Urdu as some of the main language groups at P.S. 150Q. In addition to 
collecting data reports from ATS, blue emergency cards, and HLIS, we also conduct individual interviews with 
families that first enter our school building to identify and assess language preferences of the parents in our 
school community. Once this data is collected, a list is created and letters are sent home in English and parents' 
preferred language to increase parent engagement. In addition, P.S.150Q utilized the Department of Education's 
website for important translated notifications and documents, that help keep the parents engaged in their child's 
education. P.S. 150Q makes every effort to communicate with parents in their preferred language, using in-house 
translators, and the NYC Department of Education Translation and Interpretation Unit. Throughout the school 
year, our testing coordinator and the ENL teacher regularly generate and review up-to-date ATS reports (RCPL) 
which indicate preferred languages for parents in our school community. P.S. 150Q uses the methodologies

described above to try and communicate with parents in every way possible. We are always working on ways to 
improve communication with all of the parents in our school community. For the mandated ELL parent-teacher 
conference we created a list of expectations for ELA per grade and these forms are translated into Spanish, 
Chinese, Arabic and Bengali to inform the parents about ELLs progress. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

To reach limited-English proficient families during emergencies, we use in house staff for translation. We also use over 
the phone translation and interpretation services when we need to contact limited-English-proficient family. We also 
use the google translate application if there is a need. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Parent’s Guide to Language Access brochure is given out to all staff and training is conducted implementing the 
procedures set forth in the guide to help access services in their preferred language parents' preferred language. ‘I 
Speak’ cards are displayed at the lobby of the school. Safety Agents have access to ‘I Speak’ cards and they are 
informed how to utilize these cards for Limited English Proficient visitors to the school. An internal letter will be sent 
to school staff twice a year reminding them of their responsibility to guide parents to use translation and 
interpretation services when there is a need. During Chancellor’s Conference days with the staff in September, the 
Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 is reviewed. To meet the compliance, some of the resources we utilize are: Translated 
signage, NYC DOE Office of Translation and Interpretation services, bilingual in-house staff, Home Language 
Identification Survey, written and verbal communication form, Parent’s Preferred Language Report on ATS, the 
internet applications. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Upon entrance to P.S .150Q, the translated signage is displayed informing parents that translation and interpretation 
services are available in multiple languages. Also, in the school’s office translated signage is posted. 

 

‘I Speak’ cards and translation signage can be found by the Parent coordinator’s office and at the security officer’s 
desk in the lobby. For families who speak a primary language that is neither English nor a covered language, we seek 
the Translation and Interpretation Unit’s services to translate documents as well as to communicate verbally. 

 

P.S. 150Q provides each parent, whose primary language is a covered language, and who require language assistance 
services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. This document includes their rights regarding

translation and interpretation services. Parents are informed of their rights and how to utilize the Department’s 
website concerning translation services during Open Houses, Parent workshops and ELL Parent meetings. During PTA 
meetings, parent workshops, school events such as international parent’s night, parents are informed about their 
rights to obtain translation and interpretation services. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P.S. 150Q will conduct parent surveys in their preferred language throughout the school year to gather information 
and data on the quality and availability of services that are presented to them. In addition, our Parent Coordinator will 
frequently monitor feedback from parents through formal and informal parent conferences. We also guide the 
parents to leave feedback for their experience by calling DOE at (718) 935-2013 or emailing Hello@schools.nyc.gov.
