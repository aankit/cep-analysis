Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS21X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS21 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSAState accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
As indicated in analyzed data from Fountas & Pinnell, NYSESLAT, EDAT, NYS ELA and math 
scores indicate the need to direct our focus on reading and writing skills. The after school 
extended day program will service ELL students at all levels in grades K-5 from October until 
May after the NYSESLAT exam. There will be approximately 22 sessions for the two programs. 
The programs are to support our ELLs needs across grade levels. The first program is for 
students in grades K-3 (SIFE or non-SIFE students in grades 4-5 who meet the criteria) who are 
newcomer ELLs and need extra support in foundational reading skills and topical support in 
assimilating to the United States. The identified students will be at the entering/emerging levels 
and/or have arrived in the United States within the past 3 years. This newcomer program will 
account for students who need to meet grade level standards all the while becoming accustomed 
to a new country and possibly first experience in school.  Their sessions will be supported 
through the Wilson fundations program and  Reading A-Z program which provides foundational 
and guiding reading skills for ELLs as well as vocabulary program for ELLs that includes 
weather, school, colors, sports, health and other topics. The program will be taught by one 
certified teacher with Common Branch certifications with an ENL teacher rotating in for at least 
45 minutes to provide language support. Depending on need, a second certified Common Branch 
teacher might be needed. This program will be offered on Wednesdays from 2:30-4:00. The 
second program is for students in grades 2-5 at all proficiency levels including students who 
scored at the commanding level. This program will target about 55 ELL students in 
language/literacy and mathematics (problem solving) skills in both receptive and expressive 
English.  The program will be taught in English, and using supplemental high interest materials 
as the core of instruction.  Native language support will be provided in the forms of bilingual 
dictionaries, glossaries, and student buddy system. The instructional program will be taught 
by three certified teachers with Common Branch certifications and two certified ENL 
teachers. Students will be divided into three groups by NYSESLAT grade bands, 2, 3-4, 5. The 
ENL teachers will rotate for 45 minutes in each group to provide language support. One ENL 
teacher will meet with the newcomer group for at least 45 minutes and rotate to the 2nd grade 
group to provide language support. While the second ENL teacher rotates between the 3-4 grade 
group and the 5th grade group for at least 45 minutes each to provide language support. The 
three teachers will plan lessons and differentiate instruction that is consistent with ongoing 
assessment.  Additionally, the children will be exposed to a variety of multicultural folktales, 
folklore and activities through the use of Readers' Theatre. Each week one student from grades 3-
5 will visit the newcomer group to read a story towards the end of the session. This will facilitate 
community building, confidence in the reader and listening skills among the newcomer group. 
This program will be offered on Wednesdays from 2:30-4:00 and meet for approximately 30 
sessions from October until after the NYSESLAT exam in May. This year will be the third year 
of the family English group which provides English instruction through Rosetta Stone software. 
This program will be offered on Wednesdays during the ELL after school program from 2:30-

another 15 family members sign up this year and we anticipate the same interest again. Due to 
high interest and motivation from the participants, we will begin the sessions earlier in the school 
year when the Title III extended day program begins. In addition, we select the version of 
Rosetta Stone that allows participants to use the program at the library, mobile devices and at 
home, if possible.The estimated make up of the groups are:

The language instruction will be in English with native language support as described above.  All 
communication with parents will be translated in their native language.  Attendance and all 
student assessments will be kept on file. 
 
Currently, the total cost of the program for 6 providers at 22 sessions total, each for 1.5 hours 
will be $12,008.70. We are allocated $12,366.00. 
For the addition of a 23rd session, if possible, the school will complement the remaining cost of 
the program ($545.85) using other funding sources.

strategies, writing languaeg objectives, working with ELLs who have IEPs, new language 
progressions and Targets of Measurement for the NYSESLAT exam 3. Using data to 
communicate with parents about student progress: progress reports, and parent teacher 
conferences.In addition, ENL teacher attends professional development workshops outside the 
school offered by the following agencies:• BFSC and DELLS-turnkeys to the teachers in the 
Title III programThe ENL coordinator distributed a needs survey to classroom teachers to see 
what type of professional development they would like in order to support their ELLs. Using that 
data, the ENL coordinator will plan professional development sessions in conjunction with the 
Bronx Field Support Center and other outside resources.The sessions will positively impact the 
ELL's because the teachers will use what they have learned in their instruction with the students. 
In addition, teachers will have a better understanding of how to serve their ELLs in their 
classrooms as a part of the general education population. They will also become more 
comfortable with congruency between the NYSESLAT Targets of Measure, CCLS, and the 
language progressions. Teachers will also see parallels between ENL instruction and general 
common branch education.  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
 Many of our ELL parents are hesitant to come to the school and are  uninformed 
about  education in the United States. Therefore, in order to assist them in being more familiar 
with and to help them help their children our ELL parents will be offered workshops throughout 
the year in the library.  The ENL teacher will create fliers, keep the agendas, attendance, and 
notes from the meetings. Anticipated workshops include New York City Public Library 
services,  navigating the DOE, educational rights of immigrant families, and supporting your 
child in ELA and math.  The ENL teacher also anticipates coordinating special workshops during 
parent engagement Tuesdays with cluster teachers for parents and students. Such workshops 
might include exercise activities, science experiments, music appreciation, cultural art projects 
and using the library. The ENL teacher hopes to host at least 1 parent engagement Tuesday 
session a month for ENL families to encourage parent/teacher partnerships. Parents will be 
notified via fliers, monthly newsletters and special announcements that are translated into the 
parents preferred languages. In addition, all letters to parents are in English and their preferred 
home language according to ATS. The ENL teacher communicates to parents via the app 
"Remind" that safely sends text messages to parents in their preferred language and allows for 
both parties to safely exchange text messages. We have staff members who will interpret 
meetings. Based on anticipated attendance, we will plan for interpretation services for families. 
We plan to have families "RSVP" to have an anticipated attendance. And as needed, staff 
members use the language line from the translation and interpretation unit to communicate with 
parents over the phone.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

-Deadlines include October, March and June for Fountas & Pinnell -BOY, MOY, EOY exams for GoMath 
Administrative follow up through emails and grade level meetings 
Annual review meetings, triennials for students with disabilities 
SuperKids assessments are after each unit 
Diagnostic assessments are given prior to each unit 
Formative assessments are given in the middle of the unit and the summative assessments are given at the end of the unit.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
-Fountas & Pinnell Reading Assessments 
-SuperKids ELA end of unit and progress tests for grades K-2 
-GoMath beginning of year, mid year, end of year and end of chapter tests for grades K-5 
-Performance based assessments for grades 3-5 
-ELA Core curriculum Expeditionary Learning for grades 3-5 
-Diagnostic, formative and summative assessments for grades 3-5 
-ELL Periodic Assessments 
-NYC performance tasks (MOSL tests) 
-NYS ELA and Math tests for grades 3-5 
-NYS Science test for grade 4 
-NYSESLAT test for grades K-5 
-Students who receive Response to Intervention (RTI) are assessed frequently to measure progress 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

-NYS ELA and Math tests for grades 3-5 
-Students are recommended for RTI services based on their scores from the tests above and other school performance. 
-Students who are two or more grade levels below in reading are recommended for RTI. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Classroom teachers can group children according to assessment scores. Based on the data from the RTI provider, the RTI 
committee determines whether they should receive Tier III or continue the Tier II services. Students receive Tier II and Tier III 
instruction in 6 week cycles at which time service providers report on student progress. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT, state ELA and Math tests

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, we will launch a pilot program of kindergarten and 5th grade integrated ENL 
services. The general education students will be grouped as an ENL cohort in one class per grade. The ELL-SWDs will 
receive integrated services in their assigned classes but will join the cohort during standalone services. Starting in 
kindergarten will allow for continued growth of the integrated program each year as a new group of students enter 
the school. In addition, an integrated model with the 5th grade students will begin to prepare the students as they 
enter middle school the following year.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is met minimally according to the part 154.2 ENL units 
of study and if the schedule allows, students at the entering and emerging levels will receive extra minutes of instruction.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
During integrated instruction, the ENL and classroom teacher will co-teach using the models of co-teaching which may vary 
from day to day depending on a variety of factors. The classroom teacher will prepare the overall theme/goals of the lesson 
and then the ENL teacher will write language objectives which will be used for the entire class. Working together, the two 
teachers will design a lesson that meets the content and language objectives with multiple entry points and differentiated 
instruction for ELLs. The ENL teacher will be able to provide support in terms of vocabulary, finding meaning through language 
within a text and targeted, specific instruction for ELLs. The goals of the lesson will also be Common Core Learning Standards 
(CCLS) aligned and then further aligned with the NYS Targets of Measure which stem from CCLS. The ENL teacher will be a co-
teacher for all students, not only the ELL students so every student will benefit from a targeted, language approach even 
during math instruction. The integrated approach will allow for SIOP methods and more scaffolds to be applied within each 
lesson to strengthen the core content for ELLs. The standalone instruction will reflect the ELA content in the classroom while 
meeting the NYS Targets of Measure. The standalone instruction will model the classroom lesson plan set up with a mini 
lesson, guided practice and independent practice with opportunities for small group, independent and whole group activities. 
There will be language and content objectives during the standalone instruction as well. These objectives will again reflect the 
ELA content but with more specific goals for ELLs.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We work with the testing coordinator to ensure that all state and city exams are ordered in the students home languages.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
  
a. SIFE: The needs of SIFE students will be considered when differentiating instruction because depending on a variety of 
factors, since these students have very limited and interrupted education. With this in mind, teachers will be flexible with 
instruction for SIFE students. The instruction will also be tailored to meet their needs. For example, if a teacher had a 5th grade 
SIFE student who reads on a kindergarten level, they would provide the student with materials related to the content but not 
at grade level. If this student had to do research on the Statue of Liberty, but cannot read a grade level article on the topic, the 
teacher would provide the student with pictures or videos as a way to research. They would also be provided with the support 
of a newcomer student in terms of reading support. SIFE students also need time and flexibility since they have many other 
factors going on in their lives such as adjusting to school, a new country and learning a new language. These factors need to be 
considered for SIFE students. 
b. Newcomer: Newcomer students need many scaffolds, sentence frames, modeling and visuals in their instruction. 
Newcomers need multiple entry points to support learning at many levels. Newcomer ELLs, especially younger newcomer ELLs 
pick up a lot of information as they spend the day in school so at any given lesson the teacher might not be aware that their 
newcomer has background knowledge in this topic. They also need reading support since they are not yet literate in English. 
Like SIFE students, newcomer ELLs need time since they too are adjusting to so many new things at once. 
c. Developing: Developing students still need some scaffolds, sentence frames for more difficult language structure, some 
modeling and some visuals. They too also need multiple entry points during instruction. Developing ELLs need all the supports 
mentioned before but they also need to be challenged. By challenging developing ELL students while using scaffolds, modeling, 
sentence frames etc, it allows students to learn these skills so when they are challenged independently they can apply these 
skills. Developing students also need to be constantly growing their vocabulary and reading books to support their language 
growth. 
d. Long term: Long term ELLs might be long term for a variety of reasons so it would be wise of the ENL and classroom teacher 
to look into the reasons why this student is a long term ELL. By doing some research about the student, it could provide 
valuable insight to the students instructional needs. For example, there might be a 2nd  grade student who is reading at a 
kindergarten level and not making the progress they should be making. By looking at the ELL Data Analysis tool, the teachers 
can see that this student has been held over twice because of excessive absences totaling up to two years of missed 
instruction. Knowing this information can help the ENL and classroom teacher understand what this student needs and how to 
reach their goals. These students also need to be challenged so that they can meet grade level standards. 
e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status: These students may be former ELLs but they will still need support 
accessing the content area material. These students have learned differently from their non-ELL peers because they were 
juggling learning English and content area material. Former ELLs should receive some support such as sentence frames, 
modeling or small group instruction. The skills they learned as an ELL should continue to be reinforced in the classroom 
setting. They should also be paired up with ELL students to act as either a language buddy or an extra support in the 
classroom.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs utilize multiple entry points, sentence starters, jigsaw and differentiated groups to provide access to 
academic content areas and accelerate English language development. They also use centers to provide targeted instruction 
for students who are at different levels or need help in certain skills. They use programs such as Imagine Learning, Reading A-Z 
and other apps on the iPad to help meet their goals. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In the beginning of the year, all related service, RTI and ENL providers meet to coordinate schedules so that ELL-SWDs are not 
being pulled from the classroom at the same time or too many times during the day. We also try to target our standalone 
instruction for the areas that ELL-SWD need help. For example, the reading RTI providers will pull students during ELA 
instruction and the math RTI providers will pull students during math instruction. The ENL provider will take students for

standalone instruction during ELA instruction. In addition, the ENL teachers attends all IEP meetings to provide progress 
reports for each ELL-SWDs. The ENL teacher also reviews the IEP goals so that they are aware of the students goals for the 
year.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Wilson Reading Program 
Award Reading 
Math Triumph 
Kindergarten "Kindervention" Program for ELLs 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are considering adding a RTI like program for newcomer and SIFE ELL students. This instructional time will be used to 
target ELLs who may be in a grade level where the initial reading skills (alphabet, letter sounds, blends etc.) are not a part of 
the ELA curriculum, like grades 2-5 or after the beginning of 1st grade. This will allow these students to receive reading 
instruction in a small group setting. Students for this program will be determined by the ENL teacher and the data from the 
Fountas & Pinnell beginning of the year tests.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are invited to all programs offered at the school. The ENL teacher also encourages students and families to attend 
programs offered at the school. ELLs are also invited to the general education Saturday Academy program and the ELL after 
school program. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Imagine Learning 
Reading A-Z 
MyON 
NYSESLAT Finish Line for New York ELLs 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is given through dictionaries, translator apps, bilingual apps, and through the program Imagine 
Learning where students receive instructions in their native language. Students are also paired in language buddy pairs to 
support each other in the home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Resources are differentiated by age/grade level, needs and student abilities. All teachers including classroom, cluster, speech, 
counselor, ENL, special education, use visuals, technology, multi modal centers in order to reach all students by their age, 
grade level, need and student abilities. In addition, students are grouped by their age and grade level, then further 
differentiated by needs and student abilities.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The ENL teacher is present during the initial registration process to complete the HLIS and informal interview. After that is 
completed, the ENL teacher will bring the student and parent/guardian to meet the teacher and visit the classroom. 
Sometimes this is done after registration, other times it is done on the first day of school for the student. In addition, the main 
office staff provides parents/guardians with all the pertinent paperwork that families need, i.e. calendars, event fliers, 
dismissal information etc. On the first day of school for the student, the ENL teacher takes the student for a tour of the 
building with a buddy from their classroom. During the tour, they learn where the cafeteria, bathrooms, water fountains, main 
office and other importation locations in the school are located. In addition, during the tour new students are able to meet 
teachers and staff so they can recognize familiar faces. The ENL teacher invites the family to attend the parent orientation to 
complete the parent survey. Lastly, all ELLs are invited to all activities as they happen through the year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
We distributed an ELL needs survey to classroom teachers that addressed professional development needs. Based on the 
surveys returned, classroom teachers would like better understanding of the ELL targets of measure and how they relate to the 
common core standards, writing language objectives and determining language vs. learning disabilities. Based on these results, 
we plan to invite members from the Bronx Field Support Center (BFSC) to provide training during the Monday professional 
development time. In addition, the ENL teacher will coordinate with the school psychologist and school counselor to provide 
training on how to determine language or learning disability. We have also offered a per session workshop for teachers to 
attend on the educational rights of immigrant families which reviews immigrant rights within the United States education 
system. We plan to offer this workshop again each year for those teachers who did not sign up before. Lastly, the ENL teacher 
attends the monthly ELL liaison meetings offered by the BFSC and attends workshops provided by the Department of English 
Language Learners (DELLS) office and BFSC. The ENL teacher also participates in online professional development courses as 
well.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL teacher attends workshops and meetings offered by the DELLS office and BFSC. All workshops and meetings lead 
towards the 50% of total hours for ELL-specific professional development. The ENL teacher forwards the payroll secretary all 
notices regarding meetings or workshops where they will be absent from the school day. The ENL teacher also keeps all 
agendas from each meeting in a professional development folder. All teachers will receive ELL-specific professional

development once a year through either a DELLS or BFSC workshop and workshops at the school level by the ENL teacher and 
other staff. Again, all agendas and attendance will be kept in a professional development folder.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs after the NYSESLAT in the spring. The ENL teacher 
provides a variety of opportunities for parents to meet such as different days with times in the morning or afternoon. The ENL 
teacher also makes herself available for a phone conference if an in person one is unavailable. The ENL teacher reviews areas 
of growth and areas of improvement. They also review a language rubric that assesses students language at multiple points 
through the year to measure targeted skills over time. Parents are notified of these meetings through letters in their preferred 
home language and through Remind.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

-ELL Family English group on Wednesdays and Thursdays 
-Chaperone on class field trips 
-ELL specific parent engagement time on Tuesdays at 2:30 such as special extracurricular activities with their students in the 
cluster/special area classes 
-Encouragement to join the PTA and work with the parent coordinator to recruit more ELL parents

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Joyce Coleman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We gather data from the information listed on part III of the home language identification surveys, ATS reports 
such as the RCPL and crosscheck that data with information listed on student emergency contact cards. In 
conjunction with the parent coordinator, we plan to conduct a parent language needs survey at the beginning of 
the year. We want to know if parents know their rights to interpretation and translation, if they have been offered 
interpretation and translation services and what we can do to help them make language more accessible at the 
school. This will be distributed to parents during the first month of school in their preferred language.

communicate with families in 
over 200 languages.) 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We would utilize the language line provided by the translation and interpretation unit in the event of a school 
emergency. We have the desk aid document for the language line within reach for any staff member using the 
phones in the main office and other common areas. In addition, we encourage all teachers to communicate to 
families using the app Remind which provides safe text message exchanges that are automatically translated to the 
parents preferred language when they register. This also allows for families to communicate back to the teacher 
using text messages. Remind generates instructions for families to sign up in their preferred languages. Lastly, we 
also encourage the medical office to utilize the language line and to download all pertinent health forms in the 
schools’ preferred languages for family members.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

As a part of the professional development time on Mondays, the ENL teacher, language access coordinator or a 
member from the translation and interpretation unit will provide a training for staff members on how to utilize the 
translation and interpretation services. This training will be given once a year and teachers always know they can 
reach out to the ENL coordinator or language access coordinator for more information. We also will make a 
translation and interpretation 101 documents for ease of access for teachers. Mid year, the ENL teacher and 
language access coordinator will provide a “translation and interpretation refresher” training during a professional 
time on Mondays. In addition, all staff members are given the language line desk aid with a note including the 
instructions for a conference call. This is distributed annually and laminated for all staff members. All staff 
members know they can conference with the ENL teacher or the language access coordinator if they are any issues 
reaching the language line or communicating with a parent. 
  

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

All parents who have a preferred oral or written language other than English will be sent a Parent Guide to 
Language Access and “I speak…” card. The school has the multilingual welcome poster in the main lobby for parents 
to see once they enter the building. In addition, the security desk and the main office both have the language 
identification guide to determine the parents’ language if staff cannot identify it. The ENL teacher has offered an 
“Educational Rights of Immigrant Families” workshop that reviews immigrant related school issues for parents. The

workshop also covers language rights of parents. For all new limited-English proficient parents, at the time of 
registration the ENL teacher has a prepared envelope with the parent guide to language access, “I speak…” card as 
well as a copy of the policy that describes parent’s right to translation and interpretation in the parents’ preferred 
language. 
  

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

For selected meetings such as parent teacher conferences and an IEP/Annual Review/Triennial meeting, a short 
parent survey in the parents’ preferred language would be given to parents to gather feedback on the services 
received. During the middle and at the end of the year, a more detailed parent survey in the parents’ preferred 
language would be sent home to gather feedback to improve for the rest or the upcoming year. The ENL teacher, 
language access coordinator, parent coordinator and main office staff would discuss their interactions with 
translation and interpretation and how to improve in the future. This would happen after the middle and end of 
the year surveys have been received. In addition, we would distribute a staff survey for staff members to provide 
feedback on their experiences with language services. This will also be sent during the middle and end of the year.
