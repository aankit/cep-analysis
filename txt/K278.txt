Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of Marine Park, JHS 278, is to engage its community in developing accomplished students equipped with 
the knowledge, skills and citizenship to achieve lifelong success. 

 

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Intermediate School 278 Marine Park is a middle school with 1207 students from grade 6 through grade 8. In 2017-
2018, the school population comprises 13% Asian, 44% Black, 16% Hispanic, and 30% White students. The student 
body includes 4% English Language Learners and 19% students with disabilities. Boys account for 52% of the students 
enrolled and girls account for 48% of the school population. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-
2018 was 94.5%. 

The school community believes that all children can and will achieve their potential and become productive, literate, 
responsible citizens. Ambassador teachers visit other schools in the district to learn about successful practices. They 
Ambassadors share their experiences with teachers on their grade or content teams and through professional 
development sessions they facilitate. The 2017-2018 School Survey indicates that 99% of teachers agreed or strongly 
agreed that at their school teachers talk with one another about instruction increasing instructional coherence which 
is an increase of 4% from the previous year, Collaborative Teaching is a strength. Teachers have developed a rigorous 
program aligned to the New York State Common Core Standards. The school community developed a program of 
collaborative, coherent instruction which includes working in teams, with parents and the community, to provide 
intensive instruction and enrichment in every area for all our students and also builds upon Strong Family-Community 
Ties. This enables all students to be prepared for High School and provides a lens toward college and career 
readiness.  

Our school has many structures in place that align to our focus. School's focus is that by engaging teachers in a 
collaborative professional learning process where the design and delivery of curriculum will foster increased student 
outcomes. 

The staff at Intermediate School 278 works diligently to ensure student achievement. Referencing the Framework 
Element of Collaborative Teachers, the teachers take ownership of their professional responsibilities and professional 
learning needs through participation in the United Federation of Teachers embedded professional development, 
lunch and learns, common planning periods, and the sharing of best practices. Classroom tasks have become more 
rigorous within each unit. Teacher teams routinely use data from the assessments to drive instruction, change 
lessons, and create and enhance curriculum aligned to the common core. Continuing with the Framework Element of 
Rigorous Instruction the rigorous skills, such as annotating through note-taking, highlighting, and citing textual 
evidence, are embedded in lessons across grades and subjects. To maintain Effective school leadership Framework 
element teachers, along with administrators, work on units of study and lesson plans which include multiple access 
points for all students. School leadership facilitates inquiry teams for data driven changes throughout the curriculum 
and lessons. The staff is constantly and continually adjusting curriculum based on data, needs assessment, and the 
self-reflection of students, teachers and administrators. Across the school, teachers use common assessments to track 
students’ progress across grades and subjects, and consistently provide students with specific next steps, scoring with 
school created rubrics, using Student Work Assessment Pieces, known as SWAPS, on all draft and published works. 

The principal has launched a round table which allows parent representatives from each class to be involved in the 
educational, social and emotional decisions of their grade and school. The principal has also initiated a Student 
Council in which each class is represented during a monthly meeting. This meeting includes discussion regarding 
citizenship and addressing the needs of the students. The school has an award winning performing arts program, 
engaging more than 400 of our students. Our instrumental music and vocal music students participate in The New 
York State School Music Association, New York State Music Association adjudication annually. Our school also 
partners with Inside Broadway in order for our teachers and students to receive training by professional Broadway 
staff. This partnership culminates in two annual theatrical performances, one of which is a dramatic production of a 
novel or play which our students read in English; the other is a Broadway musical which involves many students from 
multiple departments such as theatre, fine arts, music and technology. Students create scenery, costumes, playbills, 
and tee shirts, and coordinate all behind the stage work. 

School involvement in philanthropic endeavors such as Penny Harvest, Breast Cancer Awareness, Making Strides 
Breast Cancer Walk, Toys for Tots, Saint Jude’s Children Hospital and Relay for Life has become a successful driving

force of achievement. This success is due to outstanding and gratifying support by staff and students. Students work 
harder to achieve greater results because of this sense of pride, commitment, purpose, and integrity. 

The strengths of the IS 278 derive from the school-wide uniformity of the implementation of the Common Core 
Standards in all subject areas, protocols, grading systems, strategies, and communication with parents through 
PupilPath, school-websites, email and progress reports. Our goal for our students is to become critical thinkers and 
problem solvers as part of our commitment to high school/college and career ready initiative. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Intermediate School 278 has implemented the ASD Nest ( autism spectrum disorders) program which serves students 
with ASD and typically developing students in a reduced class-size Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) model, with one 
special education teacher and one general education teacher. Our gifted and talent classes are geared to support the 
needs of all students. The need for a student with a disability to receive individual specialized/specially designed 
instruction has traditionally led to the student being recommended to receive services in a special class setting. 
Modifying or adapting instruction to meet the individual needs of a student with a disability may be accomplished by 
the provision of specially designed instruction in the general education classroom. 50% of the ASD Nest students took 
4 regent exams to acquire high school credit.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

IS 278 has made the most growth in creating a professional learning community which has cultivated a higher level of 
trust and support amongst teachers throughout the school. This encompasses most of the elements of the 
Framework for Great Schools the staff collaborates in a supportive environment which leads to trust. We will continue 
to concentrate on parent involvement and communication between school and home.  Our focus is to close the gap 
between our English Language Learners and the non-English Language Learners.  

It is imperative to follow the Framework for Great Schools. Rigorous instruction that actively engages all of our 
students, via critical thinking skills. Our school has a culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by 
their teachers and peers. Teachers and colleagues are committed to enhance education through collaboration. The 
Principal along with her assistant principals nurture the students and teachers to foster academic growth. Strong

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The most recent Quality Review data indicates that the Instructional Core indicators 1.1, 1.2 and 2.2 in our school are 
Well Developed. These indicators speak to how our school ensures that students are engaged in rigorous instruction 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards, how our teachers' pedagogy is based in a 
set of coherent beliefs around how students learn, how our assessments of curricula are aligned to the content and 
are on-going, and how the data from the assessments are utilized. The findings were that teaching practices are 
aligned to the curricula and are based on the belief that students learn best when they are active participants in their 
learning. According to the reviewer, "However, not all instruction strategically provides extensions and multiple entry 
points into the curricula". To enhance the quality of questions and prompts within each lesson plan's task, teacher 
teams will also ensure that benchmark assessments and question prompts within lesson tasks are aligned in terms of 
challenge and expectation. In this way, gaps between day to day instruction and periodic summative assessments may 
be narrowed, while providing better data for teachers to support specific identified individuals or groups of students.  

During the Principal Performance Review of June 2019 it was recommended that the school continues to "revise goals 
set for teachers and students to ensure that high expectations are met. These revisions will ensure that coherence 
between what is expected and what is performed. Students can be empowered to set their own benchmarks while 
teachers guide the progress". (3.1) The data and supervisory visits suggests continued outreach to parents.  

 

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, to continue to close the achievement gap between English Language Learners and non-English Language 
Learners in mathematics by 8% in the area of expressions and equations as measured by both informal school-based 
assessments and the New York State mathematics test. This goal is aligned with our district goal to improve learning 
outcomes for English Language Learners in mathematics.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teacher Teams create units of study based on data analysis of 
student work for instructional planning and unit/lesson 
adjustment. Horizontal Teacher teams meet weekly to discuss 
individual students, set goals and analyze data (as needed) (3.3, 
3.4). Instructional planning includes teacher pacing according to 
students' ability, embedding enrichment within each lesson and 
providing opportunities for students to develop rich and 
meaningful conversations. 

Teacher teams will look at student work in a collaborative 
process in order to become analytical about the effectiveness of 
their instruction, better understand students’ learning and 
development, develop more effective curriculum and 
assessment, infuse deeper levels of rigor into instruction, and 
find ways to help students do higher quality work. By bringing 
samples of authentic student work to the table for the purpose 
of close analysis, teachers are able to address important 
questions about teaching and learning, and deepen their 
understanding of the work they do with students in the 
classroom.  

Teachers will engage in collaborative professional meetings 
(common planning) weekly, as well as during the UFT 
Professional Learning Communities. Teams will work on variety 
of tasks, beginning with looking at student work and leading to 
lesson revision, assessment planning, and examining curricula 
vertically and horizontally. Teams will then meet monthly by 
grade and subject to discuss observations, trends, weaknesses, 
improvements, and successful practices.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
NYC School Survey in the area of School Culture the data indicate students are 88% satisfied with the school culture. 
In this same area our parents are 90% satisfied with the school culture. Looking more closely at the survey the data 
indicates that our students feel safe, comfortable and are being educated in an environment that is conducive to 
rigorous learning however there needs to be an improvement to make the students feel more secure.  

 

Our school’s PBIS Team (Positive Behavior Intervention Support) will work with our teacher teams to build a 
consistent practice of strategies to ensure positive student behavior across all classrooms. This current year Principal’s 
suspensions have gone from 103 to 63 representing a 40% decrease from the previous school-year. Additionally, 
superintendent’s suspensions have gone from 24 to 14 representing a 42% decrease from the previous school year. 
The leadership team continually monitors and enforces these practices. While we have made good progress, we want 
to deepen the consistency of practices across the school to ensure continued improvement. 

 

Unfortunately, 51% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes at their school, most students follow the 
rules in class. (Q6b), this is indeed an area for improvement.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school will develop and implement a peer-buddy program in order to help support sixth graders in 
their transition to middle school, as measured by an increase of 10% in the number of students responding positively 
on supportive environment within the New York City School survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

This year’s baseline MOSL in English Language Arts illustrates that a substantial number of students (grade 6 , 34%; 
grade 7, 46%; and grade 8, 33%) fell into the bottom third, and failed to recognize and present counterarguments in 
their thinking, and thereby, their writing. 

The process of looking at student work in a collaborative manner helps teachers take a closer look at how they teach, 
enabling them to shape and revise curriculum on an ongoing basis. Educators who look at student work in a 
collaborative process become analytical about the effectiveness of their instruction, better understand students’ 
learning and development, develop more effective curriculum and assessment, infuse deeper levels of rigor into 
instruction, and find ways to help students do higher quality work. By bringing samples of authentic student work to 
the table with colleagues and looking closely at them, teachers are able to address important questions about 
teaching and learning, and deepen their understanding of the work they do with students in the classroom 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, Assistant Principals and teachers will participate as part of a data inquiry team in order to analyze student 
work products, discern student strengths and weaknesses, research potential strategies and tailor instruction for all 
students; including students with disabilities, English language learners and advanced students measured by classroom 
performance on formative and summative assessments in all subjects. (3.4, 3.3, 3.5)

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. J.H.S 278 Marine Park School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Intermediate School 278 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

The 52 students in grades 6, 7 and 8 will be provided with an additional content instruction after 
school on Wednesday and Thursdays from 2:30-5:30 pm. The after school program will begin in 
October 2018 and will continue through May 2019 for 38 sessions. The students will also be 
provided with access to the technology and research capabilities of the library computer lab. 
Marine Park I.S. 278 developed and implemented a plan for providing direct supplemental 
language instruction and educational services to all English Language Learners. Through their 
participation in this program, English Language Learners will continue to develop cognitive 
academic vocabulary skills and higher order thinking skills in English and math instruction. At 
the same time they will be empowered to access the necessary content skills required by the New 
York State CCLS. In our continued commitment to raising CCLS, students will receive 
instruction through Achieve 3000 in the following areas: ELA, Science and Social Studies and 
direct for math instruction. Our Title III Programs, the only program on site, is monitored by an 
Assistant Principal who supervises instruction, provides professional development and facilitates 
outreach to ELL parents by providing parent workshops. In this program teachers use ELL 
methodologies focusing on listening, speaking, reading and writing. Our Highly Qualified ELA 
and content area teachers will work in conjunction with the licensed ELL teacher by both co 
teaching and with leveled groups for 45 minutes each session. Upon analyzing the data students 
are put into three flexible groups based on NYSESLAT proficiency scores Entering- 9 students, 
Emerging- 6 students and Transitioning- 17 students, Expanding -21, Commanding – 15 and 
Former  ELLs – 15.  All ELL students will be invited to the After school academy. Grade 6- 15 
students, grade 7- 23 students, grade 8- 27 students. All students will take a pre test in Achieve 
3000 to establish Lexile score and will continue to be assessed during the program to ascertain 
student growth. A post test at the end of the program will provide evidence of student growth. 
Direct Math instruction will provide targeted instruction on the strands ratio and proportion and 
number sense using "Go Math" resources. As well as math fluency from Engage NY.  A pre and 
post test will be given to show evidence of student growth.  Is September 2017 the average 
Lexile score for the ELLs was 421L.  Which increased to 554 by June 2018.  Students data is on 
going and groups are flexible. Students will be co-taught by the content and ESL teacher for 45 
minutes each session. The additional 45 minutes each session will be dedicated to Achieve 3000 
and Math using ESL best practices. 
*Students are instructed in English with native language support in the form of written texts, 
dictionaries and glossaries. 
*The teacher creates units of study based on student need and specific needs outlined by content 
area teachers. 
*Content area texts are used during those sessions, augmented by other material available to 
support instruction of each unit or group of lessons. Audio reading materials will be utilized to 
provide added support to students as they master new literacy skills. This service is above and 
beyond the mandated ESL units. 
Targeted interventions for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are provided in order to 
prepare ELLs for the ELA State exam. We offer State exam prep classes for both on-track and

off-track ELLs.  We offer comprehensive targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and 
in Mathematics.  The Assistant Principal, ESL and  Mathematics coach and the Coordinator meet 
formally on a monthly basis and informally every week to set up credit recovery programs, 
tutoring programs and facilitate the implementation of interventions with teachers.  We have set 
up  a teacher "buddy" system through which staff members volunteer to meet with his/her 
selected group of  students to keep them on track, ensure that they attend after school classes, 
make home outreach, enroll them in tutoring and remind them of the upcoming assessments.  We 
communicate through the distribution of folders, Pupil Path grades,  school web page, e-mail and 
meetings.  Additionally, we offer Title III early morning, afternoon and Saturday academy and 
After-School NYSESLAT and ELA State exam prep tutoring.  We offer individual guidance 
sessions with students to review upcoming assessments and transcripts.  Parents are informed in 
writing (multilingual letters) of the dates and times of the ELA State exam.  Multilingual phone 
outreach is also conducted on a consistent basis to inform parents of upcoming assessments, 
attendance issues, tutoring opportunities, parent meetings, etc.  During the ELA State exam 
bilingual word-for-word glossaries are distributed.  In recent years we have purchased Georgian, 
Uzbek, Armenian, French, Bengali, Punjab, Turkish, Ukrainian and Haitian Creole dictionaries 
to accommodate to the linguistic needs of newly-arrived immigrants speaking these 
languages.   We continue to distribute Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, 
Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, Urdu and Vietnamese dictionaries.  Teacher teams address ELLs in 
ELA, particularly off-track ELLs.   We offer Title III  tutoring.  Intensive tutoring is also offered 
in all of the content-areas mentioned above.  For all content-area exams we offer students the

We offer a strong professional development program for staff serving English Language 
Learners.  It is an ongoing and comprehensive plan consisting of interdisciplinary teacher 
academies.  Teachers, Guidance Counselors and Assistant Principals share research-based 
Bilingual/ESL methodologies and practices in order to enhance English Language Learners’ 
performance in ESL, ELA and ESL content-area classes (as mandated by Federal Legislation) 
and their performance on the NYSESLAT.  In accordance with the New York City Department 
of Education’s Children First guidelines, the interdisciplinary teams of teachers collaborate to 
incorporate six main types of scaffolding.  They ensure that ELLs benefit from strong instruction 
in English through a rigorous core academic curriculum.   We focus on sharing practices that 
accelerate language acquisition and content-area skills mastery, focusing on skills that are

Part C: Professional Development  
especially challenging for ELLs. We ensure continuity of initiatives by using specialized 
curricula developed over the years.   Interdisciplinary teacher teams meet to share ESL 
methodologies and practices and to be trained in assessment methodologies.   Professional 
development efforts have also been focused on the development of training packets for English 
Language Learners to familiarize them with the terminology of the ELA State test Tasks.  This 
year a major focus will be the continued implementation of the Common Core Standards with 
special emphasis on Reading Standards 1 and 10 and Writing Standard 1.  We shall continue to 
focus on using the ELL Predictive Assessment,  Periodic Assessment,  Pupil Path, and 
SchoolNet  to empower teachers to tailor instruction to the diverse needs of our ELLs.  Pupil 
Path which is purchased, is a student information system for tracking student grading data.  It 
enables teachers to get in touch with parents by sending weekly emails regarding student's status 
and has an integrated online grade book.   We conduct professional development for all teachers 
of ELLs so that they can better serve students.  Members of teams will continue to  turnkey 
methodologies at department meetings and through small learning communities.  Through the 
integration of local, state and federal funds over the years, the ESL/Foreign Language 
Department has made significant strides to ensure that teachers of ELLs are better able to teach 
to the higher standards.  
After determining instructional needs based on testing data, school wide assessments, uniformed 
quarterly exams  we foster collaboration among staff and supervisors and to train 
interdisciplinary professional development teams to drive best practices into the classrooms of 
English Language Learners by addressing the following: 
Danielson's Framework for Teaching 
Understanding MOSL 
Formative and Summative Assessments 
Looking at Student Work and Establishing Protocols to Analyze Student Work 
Use of data from the ELL Periodic Assessment, NYSESLAT,  NYC Performance Test, 
PupilPath, SchoolNet  and State exams 
Instruction/Data-Driven Lesson Planning 
Implementing the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines:  Scaffolding and Differentiating 
Instruction to Accommodate to  the Learning Styles and Learning Rates of ELLs 
Sharing of Best Practices for Implementing the Common Core Standards 
Technology Training 
Backward Design of units and organization of instruction around Big Ideas and Essential 
Questions in each discipline. 
Development of questioning techniques to engage students in the learning process; to promote 
Accountable Talk and the implementation of  structured group work methodologies, and to 
facilitate the development of higher-order thinking skills. 
Alignment of curricula with assessments. 
Use and design of rubrics. 
Sharing of Best Practices for Preparing English Language Learners for NYSESLAT and the 
ELA State Examination

To continue to offer outreach to parents/guardians of our English Language Learners through 
multilingual Placement, Continued Entitlement, Non-Entitlement, Parent Choice, Title III letters 
, multilingual announcements and multilingual Schoolmaster outreach.   In accordance with CR 
Part 154 and Title III, parent orientation sessions are conducted in English and in the languages 
of our major populations (an on an ongoing basis for over-the-counter students) so that parents 
can be provided with appropriate information to make informed decisions and choices regarding 
the placement of their children in the appropriate programs.  Parents are informed about state 
standards, assessments, school expectations, the discipline code, programming, and diploma 
requirements for Bilingual Education, Dual Language and English as a Second Language 
Programs.  Individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least 
once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly 
progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the 
goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English language 
proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This 
additional meeting should include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or 
guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas.  We encourage parents of 
English Language Learners to participate in school events, especially PTA conferences and 
Parent Orientations.  During the orientation, schools also provide information on standards, 
curriculum, and assessments. Such meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in 
the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands. This year we 
have scheduled Title III Parent Meetings on the same evenings as Schoolwide  PTA meetings 
and after the Title III Professional Development Meetings for staff support.  We provide 
translators in the major languages at these meetings.  We will continue to host multicultural 
events to celebrate and validate the cultures represented by our English Language Learners.  We 
conducted a Parent Orientation session for parents of new students.   At this meeting we 
explained the continued entitlement letters and explained in detail the three program options for 
parents: dual language, transitional bilingual and freestanding ESL.  We explained to  parents 
that we consider their preferences and when we have twenty students speaking the same 
language on the same grade level and there is enough interest, we will offer a bilingual program. 
We conducted a Parent Orientation Session for parents of English Language Learners new to the 
DOE .  (This was described in the first section of this document).  To date we have scheduled 
five Title III Parent Meetings throughout the year.  We have scheduled meetings for parents of

Chinese, Haitian and Spanish ELLs.  We shall schedule meetings for other language groups as 
the year progresses.  At each meeting we continue to review the three programs available to 
ELLs and parent options.  
 
The following are the topics for Title III Parent Meetings:  Implementing the Common Core 
Learning Standards:  College and Career Readiness; Preparing English Language Learners for 
the ELA state test; Preparing English Language Learners and Parents of English Language 
Learners to use Pupil path for Communication; Preparing English language Learners for the 
NYSESLAT.   At the PTA meetings we provide translators in the major languages through the 
Translation Plan.  In the Fall Semester each year we mail parents of ELLs individual Parent 
Reports for the NYSESLAT.  We offer Parent Trainings to explain the data.    
 
ELL also parents need information about their child’s academic program, such as: 
Their child’s classes and who their child’s teachers are 
The school grading policy, system and report cards 
 Assessments (classroom and standardized) 
Parent conferences 
 Information about the English-language program and placement procedures  
Special services, such as gifted programs or special education as needed 
Homework help and resources 
The school library 
Clubs, sports, and extra-curricular activities. 
The ELL meetings are monthly before or after the PA meeting there will be breakout groups.   
  
All records are maintained in Skedula and PupilPath an online gradebook.  The parent is

The data team analyzes all summative data.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Students scoring in intermediate and advanced levels of proficiency perform at a higher level on periodic assessments, 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams than beginner ELL's. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During our professional learning communities the teachers will analyze the data and provide instruction to students at their 
instructional level.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Flexible programming, mainstream math instruction per licensed content teacher by grade. Each English and math 
class has double periods which is 400 minutes in each class, in addition to the content-area instruction and the 
mandated ENL/ELA instruction.        

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

     Each English and math class has double periods which is 400 minutes in each class, in addition to the content-area 
instruction and the mandated ENL/ELA instruction.  Integrated ENL/ESL (ESL methodologies in content area instruction co-
taught or individually taught by a dually certified teacher) and as well as Stand-Alone ENL/ESL (ESL instruction with an ESOL 
teacher to develop the English language needed for academic success). Pullout Model—Language Support from ESL teacher 
Push-in Mode l— ESL teacher comes into the mainstream classroom and works with the content area teacher to provide 
support.  Self-Contained ESL/Sheltered ESL Instruction from teachers trained in sheltering techniques. The language arts 
instructional include: English language arts instruction and English as a second language instruction. 180 minutes per units of

study entering and emerging get two units of study for 360 minutes per week, transitioning and expanding get one unit of 
study for 180 minutes per week, and Commanding get 90 minutes per week for an additional two years.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   English Language Learners take content-area Science, social studies and math classes.  Content-area instruction is delivered 
in English with teachers implementing scaffolded instruction and differentiated instructional methodologies to enhance ELLs' 
access to the instructional program and accelerate their English language acquisition.  Native language support is provided , 
when possible, through ancillary resources such as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries and through the implementation of the 
"buddy system" where  more proficient students speaking the same language as struggling students serve as resources to 
teachers and ELLs in the classroom.  Audio-visual materials and resources are used extensively.  SMART Boards and computers 
on wheels are used to access the Internet and we use DVDs and presentation software  since the visual modality is the 
preferred sensory modality of ELLs.  Teachers also establish an open communication with the parents and the guidance 
counselors and ESL Coordinator concerning attendance, behavior, and needed assistance. There is a high degree of articulation 
established between the ESL and other departments.  Each term the Assistant Principal and  ESL disseminate a staff 
articulation sheet identifying all staff serving ELLs and indicating the periods during which they are available for planning and 
consultation. Teachers are informed of the status of former ELLs so that they can continue to support these students in their 
continued efforts to gain proficiency in English.  Teachers also distribute bilingual glossaries and bilingual dictionaries to ELLs in 
content-area classes.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?

a. Determine what concepts and skills are lacking due to interrupted formal education.  These students are provided with 
both         whole and differentiated instruction (MAPS) using programs such as Great Leaps and Achieve 3000. 
b. Oral language is a big component for new ELL in the free standing ESL program.  Students are mainstreamed for all content 
areas , math, talent, physical education, lunch to be acclimated to students using the English language daily. 
c. Students are transitioned to a regular grade appropriate program with only pull-out services according to proficiency level. 
d. During meetings with the teachers of ELL students, we review academic skills to determine if additional support is necessary 
to improve student achievement to attain level of proficiency. 
e. Support is provided by the ESL teacher in collaboration with content area teachers as needed. 
90 minutes per week  math unit in implemented with a Math content and ENL teacher.   
All testing accommodations are met as per the testing administration  handbook SAM.   
    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The use of audio, videos, smartboards, Achieve 3000, Read 180, and the appropriate grade curriculum infuses academic 
vocabulary, annotated texts, abridged versions of text and tasks to support learning for ELL students throughout the units of 
study.  In addition, reading of high interest, low level books, abridged versions are given to motivate our ELL students.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?

Flexible programming, mainstream math instruction per licensed content teacher by grade. Each English and math class has 
double periods which is 400 minutes in each class, in addition to the content-area instruction and the mandated ENL/ELA 
instruction. We ensure that all ELLs receive RTI programming will provide Tier II, Tier III intervention to remediate all basic skills 
that are deficient.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted interventions for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are provided in order to prepare ELLs for the ELA State 
exam. We offer State exam prep classes for both on-track and off-track ELLs.  We offer comprehensive targeted intervention 
programs for ELLs in ELA and in Mathematics.  The Assisant Principal, ESL and  Mathematics coach and the Coordinator meet 
formally on a monthly basis and informally every week to set up credit recovery programs, tutoring programs and facilitate the 
implementation of interventions with teachers.  We have set up  a teacher "buddy" system through which staff members 
volunteer to meet with his/her selected group of cohort students to keep them on track, ensure that they attend class, make 
home outreach, enroll them in tutoring and remind them of the upcoming assessments.  We communicate through the 
distribution of folders, Pupil Path grades,  school web page, e-mail and meetings.  Additionally, we offer Title III early morning, 
afternoon and Saturday academy and After-School NYSESLAT and ELA State exam prep tutoring.  We offer individual guidance 
sessions with students to review upcoming assessments and transcripts.  Parents are informed in writing (multilingual letters) 
of the dates and times of the ELA State exam.  Multilingual phone outreach is also conducted on a consistent basis to inform 
parents of upcoming assessments, attendance issues, tutoring opportunities, parent meetings, etc.  During the ELA State exam 
bilingual word-for-word dictionaries are distributed.  In recent years we have purchased Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian, French, 
Bengali, Punjab, Turkish, Ukranian and Haitian Creole dictionaries to accommodate to the linguistic needs of newly-arrived 
immigrants speaking these languages.   We continue to distribute Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Russian, 
Spanish, Ukranian, Urdu and Vietnamese dictionaries.  Teacher teams address ELLs in ELA, particularly off-track ELLs.   We offer 
Title III  tutoring.  Intensive tutoring is also offered in all of the content-areas mentioned above.  For all content-area exams we 
offer students the opportunity to use bilingual glossaries, word-for-word bilingual dictionaries and translated versions of the 
exam where available.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
There will be more classes available to the ELL students all contents with push in ESL support.  Targeted Mathematic 
instruction by providing an increase in math instructional periods per week.  Targeted English instruction by providing an 
increase in ELA periods per week.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 There will be no ELL programs discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We ensure that all ELLs are afforded equal access to the full range of school programs including tutoring, extended day, clubs, 
Millennium Program, sports activities, Spring Musical, etc.  These programs are invitation and application and all constituents, 
including the ELLS are notified in their preferred language.  Academic intervention, ELL methodologies, Achieve 3000, word 
Generation, Great Leaps, Anita Archer REWARDS, CHAMPS, volleyball and basketball etc.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The list includes support texts and resources in an effort to familiarize English Language Learners with the ELA State test 
tasks.  Major instructional emphasis is being placed on Reading Standards 1 and 10 and Writing Standard I.  All ESL curricula 
are aligned with the Common Core Listening, Speaking, Reading a Writing Standards.  They analyze and interpret informational 
test and are taught how to formulate arguments based on the content of the text.  Teachers use the technology of the SMART 
Board to design effective lessons.  Lessons are enhanced visually for English Language Learners and teachers make extensive 
use of audio and video and ancillary materials and resources.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Each English and math class has double periods which is 400 minutes  a week in each class, in addition to the content-area 
instruction and the mandated ENL/ELA instruction.  Home language support is delivered through technology including, but not 
limited to, Ipads, listening devises, Google translator, native language glossaries, etc,     The program model of ENL is only for 
English as new language.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We ensure that all ELLs receive RTI programming will provide Tier II, Tier III intervention to remediate all basic skills that are 
deficient. Students are placed in RTI by grade levels, which is age appropriate.  Students are given the opportunity to join in 
enrichment programs such as GAME 24. For each English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance 
on the annual English language proficiency assessment, the school must determine the additional support services to provide 
the student, taking into consideration evidence such as the following: Number of years of instruction in English as a new 
language program, English and home language literacy, Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with 
inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE), English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs, Results on the 
annual English language proficiency assessment exam, Bilingual education or English as a second language teacher 
recommendation, Content area teacher recommendation, and Parent or guardian request. Services and resources are 
differentiated to include ELL methodologies, including but not limited to,  structured lessons so students work together to 
understand what they read by listening, speaking, reading, and writing collaboratively about the academic concepts in the 
text.  Teachers include vocabulary and language development, as well as,  a variety of activities to check students’ 
understanding, acknowledging that students learning a second language need a variety of ways to demonstrate their 
understanding of concepts that are not reliant on advanced language skills. Teachers will use explicit instruction, or direct 
teaching of concepts, academic language, and reading comprehension strategies needed to complete classroom tasks. 
Teachers differentiate lessons and tasks.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The list includes support texts and resources in an effort to familiarize English Language Learners with the ELA State test 
tasks.  Major instructional emphasis is being placed on Reading Standards 1 and 10 and Writing Standard I.  All ESL curricula 
are aligned with the Common Core Listening, Speaking, Reading a Writing Standards.  They analyze and interpret informational 
test and are taught how to formulate arguments based on the content of the text.  Teachers use the technology of the SMART 
Board to design effective lessons.  Lessons are enhanced visually for English Language Learners and teachers make extensive 
use of audio and video and ancillary materials and resources.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
A student parent orientation is given just before the start of the new school to assist and inform new ELL and 6th grade 
students to our school. 
The parent coordinator provides a tour and meets with new ELL students when necessary throughout the year.  All main office 
staff contacts the ESL team including grade Assistant Principal, guidance counselor and ESL teacher to meet with all new 
admits who register at our school throughout the year.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is the language that is offered.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1. We offer a strong professional development program for staff serving English Language Learners.  It is an ongoing and 
comprehensive plan consisting of interdisciplinary teacher academies.  Teachers, Guidance Counselors and Assistant Principals 
share research-based Bilingual/ESL methodologies and practices in order to enhance English Language Learners’ performance 
in ESL, ELA and ESL content-area classes (as mandated by Federal Legislation) and their performance on the NYSESLAT.  In 
accordance with the New York City Department of Education’s Children First guidelines, the interdisciplinary teams of teachers 
collaborate to incorporate six main types of scaffolding.  They ensure that ELLs benefit from strong instruction in English 
through a rigorous core academic curriculum.   We focus on sharing practices that accelerate language acquisition and 
content-area skills mastery, focusing on skills that are especially challenging for ELLs. We ensure continuity of initiatives by 
using specialized curricula developed over the years.   Interdisciplinary teacher teams meet to share ESL methodologies and 
practices and to be trained in assessment methodologies.   Professional development efforts have also been focused on the 
development of training packets for English Language Learners to familiarize them with the terminology of the ELA State test 
Tasks.  This year a major focus will be the continued implementation of the Common Core Standards with special emphasis on 
Reading Standards 1 and 10 and Writing Standard 1.  We shall continue to focus on using the ELL Predictive 
Assessment,  Periodic Assessment,  Pupil Path, and SchoolNet  to empower teachers to tailor instruction to the diverse needs 
of our ELLs.  Pupil Path which we purchased last year, is a student information system for tracking student grading data.  It 
enables teachers to get in touch with parents by sending weekly emails regarding student's status and has an integrated online 
grade book.   We conduct professional development for all teachers of ELLs so that they can better serve students.  Members 
of teams will continue to  turnkey methodologies at department meetings and through small learning communities.  Through 
the integration of local, state and federal funds over the years, the ESL/Foreign Language Department has made significant 
strides to ensure that teachers of ELLs are better able to teach to the higher standards.   
After determining instructional needs based on testing data, we anticipate the continued need to foster collaboration among 
staff and supervisors and to train interdisciplinary professional development teams to drive best practices into the classrooms 
of English  
Language Learners by addressing the following: 
Danielson's Framework for Teaching 
Understanding MOSL 
Formative and Summative Assessments 
Looking at Student Work and Establishing Protocols to Analyze Student Work 
Use of data from the ELL Periodic Assessment, NYSESLAT,  NYC Performance Test, PupilPath, SchoolNet  and State exams 
Instruction/Data-Driven Lesson Plannning 
Implementing the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines:  Scaffolding and Differentiating Instruction to Accommodate 
to  the 
 Learning Styles and Learning Rates of ELLs 
Sharing of Best Practices for Implementing the Common Core Standards 
Technology Training 
Backward Design of units and organization of instruction around Big Ideas and Essential Questions in each discipline. 
Development of questioning techniques to engage students in the learning process; to promote Accountable Talk and the 
implementation of  structured group work methodologies, and to facilitate the development of higher-order thinking skills. 
Alignment of curricula with assessments. 
Use and design of rubrics.

Common Core Lesson Plan 
Dealing with Students in Crisis   
We offer a wide range of professional development opportunities to teachers of ELLs in suppotting ELLs as they engage in the 
Common Core Learning Standards.  In Department Meetings and teacher team meetings we continually revise and update 
curricula to reflect alignment with the Common Core and UDL Guidelines.  We work on lesson planning through Backward 
Design and train teachers in infusing the CCLS  and the UDL Guidelines into their lessons.   We train teachers in designing 
effective questioning techniques to stregthen their lessons by infusing academic rigor in accordance with the CCLS. In teacher 
teams we examine student work and develop protocols for assessing student work in light of the CCLS and the UDL 
Guidelines.  Through  Through Faculty Meetings, Department Meetings and Professional Development Workshops teachers 
share best practices for implementing the CCLS across the disciplines.  We will use data from the ELA predictives for the 
Common Core ELA State Exam to inform instruction in terms of empowering students to formulate and defend arguments 
based on the reading and interpretation of informational text.  In Title III Professional Development workshops 
interdisciplinary teacher teams share methodologies for assessing student work in light of the CCLS. The NYC News and 
Opportunites for ELLS is distributed on a weekly basis.   
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Staff is supported to assist ELLs as they transition from grade school to junior high school by focusing on student attendance 
patterns in the ninth grade, apprising staff of guidance supports and academic interventions.  Training in data gathering 
tools  and student information systems like SchoolNet and PupilPath will greatly enhance our teachers’ capacity to lead 6th 
graders to transition more easily into junior high school and 8  th   graders transition into high school.   
We continue to conduct ongoing training for all staff through teacher teams, department meetings, staff development days 
and other staff trainings throughout the school year.  There are four two-hour trainings scheduled in the Fall Semester of 
2015.  All newly-hired staff is given the following resource:  Every Teacher’s Toolkit:  Closing the Achievement Gap for English 
Learners, published by Person Longman. We also avail to all staff ELL training via NYC DOE.  As per CR Part 154.2 Professional 
development via lunch and learns for all staff, PLC UFT embedded professional development and PLC days. With the use of the 
UFT embedded Professional Learning communities our teachers will:  form a book study and application on ELL strategies with 
ELL teacher team.  Looking at ELL student work  with a protocol to modify curriculum and/or lesson plans/units. There is peer 
to peer coaching.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We continue to offer outreach to parents/guardians of our English Language Learners through multilingual Placement, 
Continued Entitlement, Non-Entitlement, Parent Choice, Title III letters , multilingual announcements and multilingual 
Schoolmaster outreach.   In accordance with CR Part 154 and Title III, parent orientation sessions are conducted in English and 
in the languages of our major populations (an on an ongoing basis for over-the-counter students) so that parents can be 
provided with appropriate information to make informed decisions and choices regarding the placement of their children in 
the appropriate programs.  Parents are informed about state standards, assessments, school expectations, the discipline code,

programming, and diploma requirements for Bilingual Education, Dual Language and English as a Second Language 
Programs.  Individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to 
parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for 
parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting should 
include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language development in all 
content areas.  We encourage parents of English Language Learners to participate in school events, especially PTA conferences 
and Parent Orientations.  During the orientation, schools also provide information on standards, curriculum, and assessments. 
Such meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or 
guardian best understands. This year we have scheduled Title III Parent Meetings on the same evenings as Schoolwide PTA 
meetings and after the Tttle III Professional Development Meetings for staff support.  We provide translators in the major 
languages at these meetings.  We will continue to host multicultural events to celebrate and validate the cultures represented 
by our English Language Learners.  We conducted a Parent Orientation session for parents of new students.   At this meeting 
we explained the continued entitlement letters and explained in detail the three program options for parents: dual language, 
transitional bilingual and freestanding ESL.  We explained to  parents that we consider their preferences and when we have 
twenty students speaking the same language on the same grade level and there is enough interest, we will offer a bilingual 
program. We conducted a Parent Orientation Session for parents of English Language Learners new to the DOE .  (This was 
described in the first section of this document).  To date we have scheduled five Title III Parent Meetings throughout the 
year.  We have scheduled meetings for parents of Chinese, Haitian and Spanish ELLs.  We shall schedule meetings for other 
language groups as the year progresses.  At each meeting we continue to review the three programs available to ELLs and 
parent options.  The following are the topics for Title III Parent Meetings:  Implementing the Common Core Learning 
Standards:  College and Career Readiness; Preparing English Language Learners for the ELA state test; Preparing English 
Language Learners and Parents of English Language Learners to use Pupil path for Communication; Preparing English language 
Learners for the NYSESLAT.   At the PTA meetings we provide translators in the major languages through the Translation 
Plan.  In the Fall Semester each year we mail parents of ELLs individual Parent Reports for the NYSESLAT.  We offer Parent 
Trainings to explain the data.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Debra Garofalo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Children's home language surveys and informal student and parent questionnaires determine the interpretation 
and translation needs of our school. There are multiple school created reports regarding parent preferred 
language. Each of our school created reports are based on ATS reports such as HLIS, RHLA, RAPL, RYOS, RSFE, 
ELPC, ELLO, RELC, RNMR, RLAT, RLCB and RBPS to name a few. . Language survey forms are reviewed to see which 
languages are spoken in our students' homes. In addition, the parent surveys affords us the opportunity to learn 
which language parents prefer. Parent needs are identified and addressed through the SLT, PA meetings, through 
the Parent Coordinator and the Learning Environment survey. Paraprofessionals and teachers serve as translators 
to parents during Parent Teacher Conferences. Translation equipment and bilingual staff are available for 
meetings and conferences. Professional resource books are available for ELL parents in the Parent Coordinator’s 
office and in the school library. Parent surveys are issued periodically to continually assess needs and efficacy of

services provided. From those surveys, we provide activities which meet the needs of those parents. Finally, 
emergency contact cards are checked as they contain parent language preference. Data is collected and updated 
quarterly or upon new admission.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

Our school has 1130 students 45 are ELLs. 4% of our students are ELLs. English consists of 96% of our parents 
preferred language. Spanish is the second highest with 1%. Our preferred languages do not reach 10% 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.
