Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

The school mission statement is as follows: 

“It is the belief of PS 59, The Community School of Technology that all children can and will learn. The school will 
provide a high quality, standards-based educational program that will allow every child to reach their maximum 
potential. We value each student, parent and staff member, are respectful of each others' differences and build on 
each others' strengths. Parents and staff members will work together to support the development of our children as 
active and thoughtful learners, able to participate as literate as technologically knowledgeable citizens in our 
multicultural world." 

We revised our vision statement with staff members in June, 2013. Our vision statement is as follows: 

” PS 59 is a school where we nurture, prepare and empower students to become resilient, responsible and independent 
community members. All members are active learners and believe that every choice we make can positively impact our 
lives and the world around us."."  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

School Partnerships: 

 These are the partnerships we have with the community: St. Barnabas Hospital, Partners in Health- 5 th grade 
program on hygiene, Fordham-Tremont Mental Health Clinic- counseling and evaluation services, New Visions- eye 
checkups, The Committee for Hispanic Children and Families- tutoring and after-school services, and the Foster 
Grandparents- classroom volunteer program, Fordham Tutors, and Belmont Library. 

 The Committee for Hispanic Children is an organization that is making a big difference for our students academically. 
They come in at the end of each day and about 30% of our students stay for this afterschool program. They take field 
trips, have clubs, get help with homework, and usually there is an academic and social improvement with students 
that are involved in this program throughout the year. 

Special initiatives being implemented in the school include the following: 

 Professional Learning Communities/ Professional Development Plan: Strategic professional learning plan for all staff 
members to encourage collaborative learning among teachers. 

 Literacy Initiative: Due to a 7% proficiency rating in our NYS ELA scores (2013-2014), we have implemented a 5-year 
plan in grades K-5 to improve student literacy. This plan involves monthly student achievement celebrations, tracking 
of specific school-wide reading and writing goals, and strategic instruction/intervention to support struggling readers. 
While our literacy scores have improved over the past 4 years, we still are a level 2 school with only 16 % proficiency 
on the ELA.  

 Teacher Collaboration: To foster a culture of professional learning, we have also created many opportunities for 
teachers to meet together, both formally and informally. We have deepened this goal by creating a master schedule 
that allows for common prep periods, an optional time every day when teachers can plan and meet with other grade 
team members. We also provide many opportunities for teachers to meet with their colleagues for professional

projects to focus on students that needed intervention in ELA and Math. Last year we created a "Lighthouse Team"- a 
group of stakeholders comprised of teacher leaders who have each taken on a focus area in The Leader in Me 
program. Each teacher led an action team of teachers, leading a project in each area. 

 School-wide PBIS plan: has been implemented over the past five years and we continue to build upon the plan each 
year. The school uses a matrix to set expectations for students in social/emotional behaviors, and holds monthly 
celebrations to highlight citizens that are showing exemplary behavior according to this criteria. We began year one of 
our implementation of The Leader in Me program, focusing on building a culture of leadership and a leadership 
environment. In year 2, we will focus on "Aligning Academics"- building leadership in the classroom. 

 Mentor/ Mentee Program: In the spring of 2015, we launched a mentoring program, pairing up teachers and staff 
members with tier 2 students in the school. Mentors met regularly with their student mentees to develop positive 
relationships and to encourage social/emotional growth in students that were struggling in this area. In 2016 we 
added students who are chronically absent to the mentee list and continued to focus on this initiative. Our 
attendance continues to be an issue, even with continued focus on students with chronic absenteeism.  

* PS 59 APP: In 2015-2016, PS 59 developed a mobile app for parents and staff, and launched the app in January 2016 
to the school community. The mobile app was a way for teachers and parents to communicate with one another in 
new ways and gave parents and families information and resources from the school and classrooms. 

* Algebra for All Initiative: We departmentalized our fifth grade in the 2016-2017 school year as part of our year 1 
implementation of the Algebra for All Initiative. We have a fifth grade teacher who has gone to several weeks of 
training over the summer and throughout the year. In the 2017-2018 school year, we continued our work with 
Algebra for All have been pushing algebraic thinking and discussions among students with all grades in the building, K-
5. In spring 2018, we developed a team of teacher leaders in math, and met weekly to discuss growth mindset in 
mathematics, The 5 Practices of Math Discussions, and rich mathematical tasks. Teachers worked to create rich math 
tasks in each grade to be used throughout math modules in the upcoming school year. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

96% of our students are eligible for free lunch. The school serves a total of 612 students, from pre-kindergarten 
through grade 5. The school population comprises 31% Black, 67% Hispanic, 1% Caucasian, 1% Asian, and 1% Other. 
The student body includes 13% English Language Learners and 28% Students with Disabilities.  

The school is currently considered a “Focus School,” according to the NYS Accountability Report.  

 

 

In our 2 PPOs and Quality Review 2016-2017, we were given ratings of proficient and well developed in all areas. We 
remain a focus school for the second year in a row because we are not meeting AYP with our subgroups on the NYS 
tests. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

School Strengths: 

 Supportive Environment/ Culture : The culture and climate of the school is by far our biggest strength. It is 
imperative that students have a warm and safe place to come every day that sets a positive tone for learning. It is also 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12 

 

important that staff members get along with one another and make visitors and community members feel important 
and valued when they come through the school doors.  

 Effective School Leadership : The leadership at PS 59 has completely changed over the past 5 years and leaders 
have built capacity and empowered teachers to take on leadership roles and professional collaboration. The staff has 
worked hard to build a strong sense of community and leaders have involved many key stakeholders in decision-
making and capacity-building. The result has been a positive shift in school culture and professional learning and 
collaboration to improve instruction and academic achievement. In our most recent quality review (2017-2018), we 
received a well-developed rating in 5.1, effective school leadership. 

 Support and evaluation of teachers through observation feedback: Administrators provide ongoing support and 
evaluation of teachers, giving specific and actionable feedback using the Danielson Framework. 

 Collaborative Teacher Teams : An area of celebration in our 2015-2106 Quality review was our teacher team work. 
In the past school year, we have worked hard to build capacity in the building with teacher teams. This included 
teacher leaders running grade team meetings each week, collaborating on inquiry projects during Tuesday 
Professional Work Time, and being actively involved in leadership during Professional Learning Communities. In the 
2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school year, teacher teams continued to be rated as an area of strength and celebration. 

 

School Challenges: 

 Academic Proficiency vs. Academic Progress: Historically our literacy and math data shows that our students 
(including ELLS and SWDs) do make a certain amount of progress across the year, but are not meeting grade-level 
standards and are not considered to be proficient. Our ELA proficiency scores in 2016-2017 were 16%, and our math 
proficiency scores were 18%. While these scores were higher than the previous year, they continue to fall below the 
city and students in subgroups did not make Annual Year Progress. 

 Attendance: Our overall attendance rate for the 2017-2018 school year was 90.1%. This continues to fall below the 
citywide expectations. We believe that this low attendance rate is directly correlated to our poor student 
performance, and despite our efforts to improve attendance and reward good attendance, our attendance rate still 
remains below expectations.  

 Parent and Community Partnerships: This year we have made improvements in our partnerships with families, but 
continue to struggle with developing strong partnerships within the community. Despite that the Bathgate section of 
the Bronx has a number of organizations such as The Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Gardens, Fordham University, 
and St. Barnabas Hospital, we have not yet been able to forge an ongoing partnership with any of these institutions.  

Areas of growth: 

Over the past two years, we have noticed a marked increase in attendance at events involving families, such as 
workshops, conferences, celebrations, etc. In conjunction with a library grant, our librarian implemented a series of 
Family Literacy Nights that encouraged parents to come in and read with their children, receive free books, and take 
advantage of opportunities to help children improve their literacy skills. Parents and families were also given 
strategies to help them support their children at home. In our pre kindergarten annex, a number of parent support 
workshops were held by staff members and our early childhood social worker to encourage family literacy and 
support families of our youngest students in supporting child social and emotional development.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13 

 

Coffee mornings with the principal also encouraged parents to come in who needed to come in on an earlier 
schedule. We additionally have an extremely active and supportive parent coordinator who makes himself available 
to parents at all times and truly acts as a liaison between the school and the family communities.  

Several other workshops and activities were offered to parents such as Bingo Night, workshops for fathers on 
interviewing and creating resumes, computer and English classes for parents, and workshops on downloading and 
using our new mobile app. 

Over the past 2 years, PS 59 has created and maintained a mobile app for parents and families as well as staff, in an 
effort to strengthen communication between the school and families. Teachers developed websites and newsletters 
that were linked through the app, which gave news, information and resources to families. Families were also give 
access to calendars, pictures of latest events, and NYC school resources such as registration applications, etc. Parents 
expressed that the app made them feel valued and kept them in the loop more than ever about what was happening 
in the school and the classrooms. 

Areas of Focus:  

According to our reviews (PPOs and QR) in the 2017-2018 school year, our biggest area of feedback involved 
improving pedagogy and instruction with meaningful assessment practices. We decided to use this feedback and 
create our instructional goal for 2018-2019 around becoming more data-centric in everything we do. Our SCEP goals 
will all revolve around this main instructional goal and will also include the teacher team structures as well as 
academic and leadership goals set through The Leader in Me initiative.

-School Quality Guide (2017-2018) 

-Principal Performance Observation Reports 2017-2018 

 

According to the data sources cited above, Indicator 1.1 (Curriculum) was an area of celebration and rated "Well 
Developed." We have chosen to use Teachers College Reading and Writing Project for our literacy curriculum, and 
Eureka Math. Our curriculum has been cited as engaging and rigorous and fully aligned to the Common Core Learning

Standards. We have focused much effort over the past few years to ensure that our students are provided with higher 
learning opportunities, and also that teachers regularly utilize data to drive their instruction.  

 

Our main area in need of improvement in this element of the Framework, as cited in the above data sources, is in 
Pedagogy. 

While our curriculum is an area of strength, teachers continue to need support in providing multiple entry points for all 
learners, including subgroups, and using data strategically to plan for small group learning opportunities. Our most 
recent feedback from the above data sources were centered on providing scaffolds for students but also increasing 
student independence. We decided to use The Leader in Me student leadership notebooks as a springboard for students 
setting academic goals for themselves based on data. Students will create and track academic goals in their notebooks 
throughout the year and will have discussions with teachers in admin about their progress in these goals. Teachers will 
help students become more focused on their own individual data and will differentiate instruction and scaffold support 
according to student needs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all students in Grades K-5 will have created and monitored at least one personal, data-driven academic 
goal, focusing on their "Habits of Reading" through the school year. This will result in an overall 10% minimum increase 
of students K-5 reading at or above grade level , as measured by the end of year TC Benchmark Reading levels.

-Leader in Me implementation 

-PBIS program in school 

-Attendance team meets weekly to look at ATS attendance reports and monitor chronic absenteeism 

-mentoring program in place 

 

Needs : 

Our school has developed a PBIS program over the past few years which has improved the climate and tone of the 
building. We have (through The Leader in Me initiative) taught students leadership skills and social emotional skills that 
will help them develop and implement goals for themselves and self monitor/ self regulate with those skills and goals. 
We have tried many strategies externally to improve attendance and lateness, including mentoring and celebrations. 
We feel that if all students have a goal around attendance and punctuality and monitor it regularly, that they will take 
more ownership over attendance in the building. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

June 2018 MOTP data showed a clear need for improvement in the area of 3b, questioning and discussion. Only 49% of 
teachers were rated effective in this component of the Danielson Framework. In analyzing this data and in reviewing 
end of year teacher reflections, we decided upon a school-wide instructional focus on improving discussion in 
classrooms. Teachers will work in teams to develop discussion protocols that will help close the achievement gap across 
classrooms. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal  

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

By June 2019, all teachers will have developed and implemented grade-wide discussion protocols for students, 
increasing the quality of discussions across classrooms. This will be result in a 10% minimum increase in teacher 
effectiveness scores in component 3b, questioning and discussion, as measured by June 2019 MOTP data.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Data Sources:  

- School Leadership Team Feedback 

- Teacher team feedback 

- Quality Review Feedback (2018) 

- School Environment Survey (2018) 

 

Strengths  

-Parent involvement is strong when teachers and students are inviting them in for celebrations and shows.

-Year one of the Leader in Me initiative went smoothly and set us up for success with many structures, including action 
teams and a lighthouse team. 

 

 

Needs  

- Parent attendance at academically centered workshops are historically low. We have been given feedback from PPOs 
and our CLR around providing more academically centered workshops to support parents. Parents also historically rate 
this low on our school survey. 

-About 55% of families attended school-wide academic conferences in the 2017-2018 school year (43% in September, 
76% in November, 73% in March, and 28% in May).  

-We continue to try out many different attempts to bring parents in, but struggle with parent attendance at academic 
meetings 

-We believe that by giving students a voice to talk about their academic progress and lead student conferences, families 
are more likely to be engaged in conferences. We decided to focus on student-led conferences as a way to increase 
family attendance in May at the end-year family open house. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
By June 2019, parents of students in grades K-5 will attend student-led parent conferences focusing on their child's 
academic growth and progress toward goals as outlined in their Leadership Notebooks. . This will result in a minimum 
10% increase in family attendance at Parent Teacher Conferences in the 2018-19 school year as compared to the 2017-
2018 school year.

We ensure that students are identified when they are registered. We connect students with the parent coordinator to 
ensure they are supported. We assist the families with educational matters, issues of transportation, and connect 
them to the services they need. We also provide students as needed with educational materials and resources. In the 
2018-2019 school year, PS 59 has been identified as a high needs school due to the percent of Students in temporary 
housing. We will be receiving a centrally funded Family Worker that will provide support for these families and 
students identified as STH.

2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44 

 

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information, 
early intervention services, etc.). 
A variety of supports are offered to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
program. Last year, we opened one more full time pre-k class in our Early Learning Annex. We have 4 full-time Pre-
kindergarten classes in our school. A large majority of these students smoothly transition into our kindergarten 
classes the following year. Our Pre-kindergarten teachers take part in our school wide professional development 
throughout the school year. Many of our parent workshops at the annex involve our Pre-kindergarten and K families 
meeting together with our social worker and Annex coordinator. The Pre-kindergarten teachers have taken part in 
multiple professional development meetings around the Pre-kindergarten CCLS and work to embed the standards 
throughout all instructional areas. Our SBST works closely with CPSE to complete the Turning 5 Process. The Assistant 
Principal has also gone to Head Start open houses to meet with families and tell them about our Kindergarten 
Program.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers were involved with selecting our K-5 assessments as part of the MOSL committee. As a Teachers College 
school, the TC Running Record Assessments were chosen to assess reading levels throughout the school. All teachers 
went through additional professional development to ensure they understood the assessment and how to use the 
results to improve student achievement. A variety of professional development and data support is provided to 
teachers. Data support is provided by the following people: 

-Literacy Coach 

-Teachers College Consultants 

-Generation Ready Consultant 

-APs/Principal 

- Pre-kindergarten teachers continue being trained this year in the Work Sampling System Process. This system allows 
the teachers to use the CCLS standards for PreK to help develop portfolios of student work samples that help them 
measure student growth over the school year. The AP is part of this training in addition to the pre-k coordinator. 

-The School Development Committee (SDC) meets with Admin in addition to coaches and instructional leads, to 
provide input on professional development and use of assessment results. Teachers look at student work and 
assessment results in professional learning communities to ensure the adapting of instruction to meet the needs of 
student goals identified by assessment data. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46 

 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 59, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I and the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 59 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●  actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title 
I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s 
Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., /State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

At PS 59 we further encourage parent participation by putting in place the following:  

  To further encourage parents to communicate with the school and be partners in their child's education, the 

school will develop a PS 59 mobile school app that parents and staff will be able to download and use. Parents

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 P.S. 59 uses the running records from Teachers' College (Fountas and Pinnell)  to assess the literacy skills of the ELL students. 
The assessment is conducted through a set of short fiction narratives (stories/passages). The stories begin at level A and go as 
high as level Z. The data is utilized to determine the fluency, comprehension and level of independence. When the students 
score below 96%, we are able to determine level of instruction. The ELLs who are at the entering and emerging levels tend to 
score poorly at the beginning of the year. However, by putting into practice our plan of instruction for the school year, by mid-
June, some of these students are able to demonstrate a year's progress; they tend to go up three to seven levels. To assess 
letter identification and recognition of high frequency words we use another tool. The data obtained from the running records 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

and the high frequency words is then used by the teachers to plan their instruction. To reinforce and strengthen the phonetic 
skills of our ELLs,  P.S. 59 uses the Fundations Program. This supplemental program emphasizes phonemic awareness, 
vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, phonics and word study. The concepts  of this program are taught by the classroom and 
the ENL teachers in ways that integrate multiple learning modalities.  The ENL teachers differentiate the  instruction of this 
program in order to support the English Language Learners.  We also analyze the data from our informal and end of unit 
assessments to drive our instruction. The NYSITELL and Spanish R-LAB  are also administered to students who are eligible for 
NYSITELL testing. The data obtained from these assessments help us get a picture of the early literacy skills of our ELLs. The 
writing rubrics from Teachers' College have been modified in order to assess the ELL students at different stages of the 
acquisition of their second language. Teachers of ELLs have also received a copy of the language progressions to help them 
assess and plan for the ELL population. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

TC Assessments are scheduled to take place five times during the school year: September, November, January, March, and 
June. Informal assessments also take place within those intervals. The assessments for letter recognition and familiarity of high 
frequency words is administered three times a year: September, January and June. The assessments for the Fundations 
Program are given at the end of every unit. Students are also assessed periodically to determine level of mastery on letter 
name and phonemic awareness. Teachers administer pre and post tests at the end of each unit to determine level of mastery, 
further reinforcement, and next steps. Administrators have instructed teachers to use an assessment tool with each of their 
lessons to assess the level of understanding acquired by their students. This can be accomplished through a quick check-list, 
teachers observations, student conferences, or by listening in to partner discussions. Teachers in each grade assess the 
writing  units with the rubrics provided by Teachers College.  These assessments are given at the beginning and at the end of 
the units. Each grade has its own separate rubric, but all grades place a big emphasis on elaboration and craft of the writer. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 P.S.59 evaluates the success of the programs for Ells by reviewing the scores of the NYSESLAT. We identify the number of 
students who moved from one stage to another. This information is utilized to determine the type of service and number of 
minutes that needs to be provided in stand alone  and as an integrated ENL intervention service. Teachers administer 
assessments at the beginning of the year to obtain a baseline in writing, reading and math. At grade team meetings, teachers 
analyze the baseline to identify trends across the class, and the grade. They use this data to  determine next steps and to 
implement their instruction. Teachers look at the results of the TC assessments to identify what the ELLs struggled with and 
what they have to be exposed to by the classroom or ENL teachers in order to move them forward. This data is also used to 
determine independent and guided reading levels. This information is also used to identify the level at which the ELLS will be 
reading the fiction and non-fiction texts through the Raz-kids program. Raz-kids is a comprehensive leveled reading program 
with hundreds of eBooks with 29 different levels of reading difficulty. Our students are able to access their leveled text 
through an interactive learning portal which keeps them motivated and engaged. Teachers also administer post assessments 
at the end of each unit to determine level of mastery and to identify concepts that need further reinforcement through small 
group instruction and at  center areas. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The administrative team has rearranged the class schedule in order to include weekly team meetings. At these meetings, 
teachers analyze their data to determine strengths and weaknesses. Teachers who wish to refer a child to RTI, must fill out a 
form which must be approved and signed by the immediate supervisor. The form is then submitted to the RTI team. One of 
the psychologist will schedule a meeting with the team. The case is discussed and as a team they agree on the type of 
interventions that are best suited for the child. Once the team has given their recommendations, the teacher must then utilize 
the resources with the child during readers' and writers' workshop. The school has also formed Professional Learning 
Communities which meet every Tuesday morning. At these meetings, teachers identify the students who have been struggling 
and falling behind. The community of teachers work together to to determine strategies and resources that can be utilized to 
strengthen the skills they are struggling with. If no progress is observed by the third week, the teachers put into action another 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

set of tools and strategies. Teachers can also refer a struggling reader to work with the Reading Recovery Specialist. The 
Reading Specialist analyzes the student's running record along with teacher's observations. The Reading Specialist works with 
the students from 12 to 20 weeks. The student is pulled out of his program to receive the intervention every day for a period 
of 30 minutes. At the end of the 20th week, the child is assessed to determine level of progress, mastery of the intervention or 
if the child is still in need of further assistance. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 When an ELL student is referred to RTI, the team analyzes the student's home language survey, the NYSITELL data, the New 
York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test, the Social History update, classroom observations, teacher's 
report, attendance report, and the NYS ELA and Math Scores. Both the ENL teacher and  the Speech and Language 
Screener  determine if the  problem is a language or a processing issue.  Based on the data and the discussions among the 
team, teachers are then instructed on the format of the instruction for the youngster. Teachers are then informed on 
the format to follow and given the necessary resources to use to help the student. As of September 2017, teachers will be 
provided with a set of tutoring and mentoring packs. They will utilize the resources of these packs to identify the students' 
strengths and weaknesses to plan their instruction. The instructional materials consists of alphabet packs, phonological 
awareness packs, phonics packs, high frequency words packs, comprehension and fluency packs. Teachers can facilitate 
the lessons from these packs in a one-to-one basis or guided through smaller group instruction. They will also receive 
additional support to utilize with the ELLs such as reading graphic organizers, forms and tools, game packs, and assessments to 
keep track of progress. The team will meet again after 6 weeks to evaluate progress and determine next steps. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We utilize the scores from the NYSESLAT are utilize to determine the level of second language acquisition for the ELL students: 
Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding. Through this data, we are able to determine the number of 
minutes of services needed for each ELL.  The ENL team along with the teachers who work with the ELLs use this information 
to plan instruction throughout the four strands: Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. The ELL Data Analysis Tool  (EDAT) is 
a detailed collection of data which teachers can utilize to look intensely at each child's academic and social records to study 
and plan for instruction. This information is pertinent for teachers to plan for individual, small group and whole group 
instruction. One can see the trends of the school, and be able to compare them citywide. 
 
The NYSITELL is used to determine eligibility of services and the child's strengths and weaknesses in their second language. On 
the Kindergarten NYSITELL, students tend to score at the entering and advance levels. However, upon taking the NYSESLAT, 
the score decreases one level at times.   
 
The running records from Teachers College are used to determine level of independence and level at which child should 
receive instruction.The data is also used to determine fluency. When the student scores below 96%, we are able to determine 
level of instruction. The ELLs who are at the entering and emerging levels tend to score poorly at the beginning of the year. 
However, by putting into practice our plan of instruction for the school year, by mid June, some of these students are able to 
demonstrate a years progress; they tend to go up 3-7 levels.  
 
A high frequency list is used to assess students on recognition of words at their grade level. Once that data is obtained, the 
teacher works on familiarizing the students with those words that they aren't familiar with. This is done through different 
strategies such as word games, magnet letters, tactile techniques (sand), repetition, echoing, " Look at it, Say it, Write it', and 
use of pictures and flash cards. 
 
The Fundations Program has been put into place in order to develop the phonetic skills in our students. Through this program 
students learn to identify the letter by name and the sound that correlates with the letter as well as the formation of the letter 
(they learn how to write it). At the end of the unit on phonemic awareness, students are assessed to determine level of 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

 

mastery. A score of 70 or above indicates that the student has a good grasp on the concept of letters. If the score is below 70, 
students receive further instruction in small group. 
 
The scores from the ELA and Math  are used to determine the number of students who are at each level (1-4), and are in need 
of further strategic instruction.  ELL students who score a 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA as well as a score of advanced or expanding on 
the NYSESLAT are considered proficient in their second language, thereby, no longer considered an ELL. 
 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The administration shares the results of New York State ELA, Math and NYSESLAT results with the faculty during one of 
our professional developments which takes place on Monday afternoons.  We are also informed of the plan that has been put 
into place, the resources that will be utilized to reinforce and strengthen the areas of concern and the manner in which this 
instruction is to be implemented. The ENL coordinator informs each teacher of the ELLs in their class, the stages they are at 
and the expectations of their second language acquisition. Teachers are also given a copy of the New Language 
Arts  Progressions,  The Target Of Measurements, and The Performance Level Descriptions which links individual targets of 
measurement to what ELLs should be able to do at each of the five performance levels: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, 
Expanding, and Commanding. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

         Freestanding ENL Program  
ELLs at the beginning (entering) and low intermediate (emerging) levels receive 360 minutes per week (2 units of 
study in ENL): 1 unit of study in ENL stand alone (pull out) and 1 unit of study in integrated ENL.  
 
Emerging students  receive 2 units of study per week: .5 unit of study as stand alone,  1 unit of study as integrated 
ENL, and another .5 unit of study as stand alone ENL or as  integrated ENL/ content area. 
 
Students who are at the intermediate (transitioning) level receive 180 minutes per week: 1 unit of study in ENL per 
week which consists of .5 unit of study as integrated ENL/ELA. and another .5 unit of study as stand alone or as 
an intergrated ENL/content area. 
 
For students who are at the advanced (expanding) level,  receive a total of 180 minutes per week which is 
1 unit of study of ENL/ELA or as integrated ENL through the content area. 
 
For proficient (commanding) ELLs students receive services for 2 years: .5 unit of study per week of integrated ENL in 
ELA or content area. The instruction is delivered by a certified ESOL teacher and a k-6 certified elementary school 
teacher who co-teach. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 

 

        At the current time we do not have a TBE program due to not having enough students who speak the same 
language on a grade level. We will monitor our intake of ELL students this year monthly and if sufficient numbers of 
students do arise we will comply with the Aspira Consent Decree.           

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

    At the current time we do not have a DL program due to lack of parent interest. We will monitor our Parent Survey 
and Program Selection Forms for an increase in parent choice of DL programs and offer a DL program if our Parent 
Choice supports it.           

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

             The ENL team is responsible for ensuring that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to 
students’ proficiency levels. For next year, ELL students will be serviced through stand alone or integrated ENL.  ELLs with 
Entering and Emerging proficiency levels will be placed into the same class to simplify scheduling for Stand Alone ENL 
Service.  All ENL teacher Schedules are kept on file in the main office and reviewed monthly to make revisions as necessary due 
to incoming enrollment. In the event of a large increase of ELLs, the Principal will be notified of the need for additional ENL 
service providers. 
 
2a. The ENL team will adapt the scheduling in order to provide all  the ENL units of study to the ELL population. Entering and 
Emerging students will receive 1 unit of Stand-Alone ENL Instruction. Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding students 
will receive 1 unit of Integrated ENL/ELA service through the Push-In Collaborative Teaching Model for ELA. Commanding ELLs 
have been placed in ELL classes and will receive .5 units of Integrated ENL/ELA .5 units a week. ELLs placed in Self-Contained 
Special Education classes will receive 1 unit of Integrated ENL/ELA in either a Push-In Collaborative setting or a Pull-Out setting 
with the ENL team. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The Stand-Alone ENL program will provide instruction in literacy specifically Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing that will 
be aligned with the ELA classroom instruction and also provide students with the academic language, vocabulary and content 
found in texts to be read in the classroom. Literacy instruction will be built around Guiding Questions that are interesting and 
complex to encourage higher level thinking skills including close reading and developing an argument. Multicultural themes 
will be embedded in these lessons to engage ELL students and provide a connection to their culture and experiences. Students 
will engage in word study and morphemic analysis to broaden their academic vocabulary.  Additionally, students will focus on 
phonics and reading fluency so that they can easily navigate new texts. Lessons will be delivered using the SIOP model. 
Teachers plan for a language objective in each lesson and scaffolds are built into the lesson to support our ELLs. Strategies that 
we use include front loading vocabulary, vocabulary translations in the native language, building background, rereading, 
teacher modeling, student pairs, small group work, graphic organizers and the development of academic conversations. 
Finally, students will be assessed formally and informally so that teachers can plan for their students’ academic needs.The 
Collaborative Teaching Integrated ENL/ELA Program will foster a partnership between the ELA classroom teacher and the ENL 
teacher to help ELL students meet the demands of the Common core Learning Standards. The ELA teacher will plan for the 
content area lessons, while the ENL teacher provides the linguistic and realia support for the ELL students in that classroom. 
The ENL teachers will infuse the content area with SIOP strategies including incorporating a language objective, building 
background, use of cognates, native language vocabulary translation, front loading vocabulary, rereading, paraphrasing, 
sentence stems, graphic organizers, teacher modeling, the development of meaningful academic conversations and teaching 
transition words to help students organize their writing. Rubrics from Teachers' College have been modified with the 
assistance of the ENL team so classroom teachers may use it to assess the ELL students. We will also be  using the New 
Language Arts Progressions to evaluate their  progress.

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Currently, our school only offers  an ENL Program, however, we do evaluate the home language through an oral interview 
question-based which is available in several languages. This survey is provided by the DOE and is administered during the 
intake interview. The Language Access Coordinator  (LAC)) has received training in the Translation & Interpretation Unit 
provided by the DOE. The LAC will be  empowering teachers and other pedagogy by training them how to access written 
translations services and over the phone interpretation. Limited-English Proficient parents will then be able to have the 
opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and services which are critical to the success of their child's 
education.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

        a. (SIFE) Differentiation for SIFE students requires instruction in concepts learned at least two years prior to the grade that 
the student is currently placed in. Our ENL Teachers look at the Common Core Standards for the grade that the students are 
currently in and plan an instructional program that will bridge the gaps they will encounter. By looking closely at the two 
previous grades of instruction in the areas of ELA and Math we can locate areas of instructional emphasis that will help 
support the students in their learning. By teaching prior skills along with grade level content, the students are better equipped 
to keep up with the demands of grade level instruction. Bilingual glossaries in all content areas will be used as well as the 
teaching of cognates. 
       b. (Entering and Emergent) Newcomer ELLs require a great deal of native language vocabulary translation in the content 
areas. This is provided by the use of glossaries, Picture Dictionaries and the teaching of cognates in content areas or Bilingual 
translation lists created by ENL teachers specific to content being taught. Front loading vocabulary, building background and 
the use of graphic organizers and paraphrasing. These strategies are essential to the success of these students. Connecting 
what is learned to students’ home cultures is also a strategy we implement. When available, these students are assigned a 
native language speaking buddy/translator. Differentiating assessments by using graphic organizers, paraphrasing the text and 
modifying assessments according to ELL student level enables the teachers to track growth in students. 
         c. (Transitioning) Developing ELLs have a beginning foundation in English Language skills that can support them in the 
content areas. At this level we focus on building background and increasing students’ academic vocabulary through word 
study, morphemic analysis and reading comprehension strategy instruction. We also work with students to build fluency and 
automaticity when reading so that they will be able to quickly navigate longer texts. Since (Transitioning) Developing ELLs have 
strong oral language skills we focus on embedding academic language in their discussions by using sentence stems. Students 
are taught to specifically use academic words in their writing and to use transitions to help frame their sentences. Rubrics are 
used to assess students in all four language strands. Students are also responsible for self-assessment. 
        d. Long Term ELLs have mastered the listening and speaking of English. They have deficits in academic vocabulary that 
impedes their learning. These students are performing at least two years behind grade level in the areas of reading and 
writing. To support growth in these students we focus heavily on the development of academic vocabulary in the content 
areas. Vocabulary is front loaded for these students in content area lessons. Background is built to connect students to the 
subject they will be learning. Word study and morphemic analysis is also taught routinely. Students are responsible for using 
this vocabulary orally through the use of sentence stems and during peer conversations. Reading Fluency skills are also 
addressed through repeated readings of fiction and non fiction texts, as well as  Readers' Theater.  Teachers focus on 
automaticity to develop and improve the reading rate of all ELLs. Teacher modeling of writing assignments (Exemplars) and the 
use of rubrics helps students become responsible for their own work. The use of academic vocabulary is used throughout all 
four language modalities. 
        e. Former ELLs will now receive .5 units of Integrated ENL/ELA which will be delivered in the Collaborative Teaching 
Model. These students have a firm grasp of the English Language; however, they may need support in the areas of academic 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66 

 

vocabulary, reading comprehension and writing. To support these students, the ENL teacher will front load academic 
vocabulary that students may have difficulty with during ELA lessons. Word study and morphemic analysis will continue to be 
used when necessary. Reading strategies to encourage close reading of text and paraphrasing will be incorporated into 
lessons. Teacher modeling of writing assignments will assist students with these tasks. Providing lists of academic words and 
transition words to support their writing will help to improve the quality of their writing. Rubrics will be used to help students 
become responsible for their own learning.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
        The instructional materials utilized for ELL-SWD that  provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English 
language development are the following: Benchmark Education-Non-fiction materials for Science, Social Studies and Math with 
e-books and graphic organizers, Finish Line Writing to develop the writing skills. Finish Line for ELLs: English Proficiency 
Practice, Sadlier Phonics, Textbooks, Targeted Phonics-Short and Long Vowel Story Books, Guided Science Readers, Reading 
and Writing sources, glossaries, dictionaries, role play (Students read and act out a series of steps from a given scenario  to 
which  they create a narrative piece in which they utilize the information to  develop an introduction,  include details with the 
use of the steps, and finalize the piece with a conclusion), group projects from the unit of study, and literacy materials to 
develop language development, The  Language Power: Building Language Proficiency through Themes. 
 
The school library also has many native language materials available in many different genres such as, fiction, social studies, 
science, biographies and novels. The P.S.59Library.org website also has materials in different languages available for students. 
Our students also have assess to the Raz-Kids Program. The Raz-kids Program is a comprehensive leveled reading program with 
hundreds of eBooks with 29 different levels of reading difficulty.   In class support is given to assist the teacher by the ENL 
team through modeled lessons. Teachers  also scaffold  the lessons for the students. If in need of further intervention,  the RTI 
team will conduct meetings to put  a plan into  place to support their academic achievement. 
 
The RTI is a standing committee created to maximize a student's success in the classroom setting who may be experiencing 
consistent academic or behavioral difficulties. This committee consists of all staff members who work with the student. Once a 
student is recommended to the RTI team, a review of the student's specific needs begins and an action plan is created. These 
strategies will then be employed for a specific period of time. At the end of this time, a follow up meeting will be held to 
determine if the student has made progress; If needed, the team may recommend further strategies or interventions.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        In collaboration with the Instructional Support Team, in order to meet the needs ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive 
environment, ELL-SWDs are part of the school full program (science, social studies, math, art, music, gym and literacy). The 
school grants modifications based on the students IEPs where needed. The school takes into consideration the 
students'  schedules for related services and lunch. ELL-SWDs receive instruction based on their IEP and we ensure they 
receive mandated services. These students are serviced by ENL teacher in a stand alone and  integrated ENL program that 
develops the English language skills through the use of classroom content in a setting adapted to their needs. An IEP team 
determines a student's eligibility for special education services and the language in which special education programs and 
services are delivered. ELLs who are also students with disabilities (SWD) receive accommodations that apply both to ELLs and 
SWDs, as appropriate.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Targeted Interventions program for ELLs in ELA takes place during the week. This intervention is conducted through small 
group and multiple pathways. Teacher scaffolds ELA materials through the use of visuals, thinking maps, graphic organizers 
and the Teachers College strategies for ELLs. Vocabulary recognition, decoding, word splash maps, double meaning word 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67 

 

maps, alphabox dictionary as well as sentence structure strategies. We also utilize the Fundations Program to develop the 
phonemic awareness in our students.  Another resource being used at P.S. 59 is the Raz- kids Program. Through this program, 
students have 29 reading levels which are accessible to them in English and Spanish. They can read fiction and non-fiction texts 
at their level and in their areas of interest. Home Language is used through cognates, dictionaries, glossaries and translation 
when applicable. 
 
Interventions for ELLs in Math take place through small group and multiple pathways. Students have manipulatives to aid them 
with comprehension of the material. NY Engage Math strategies for ELLs are also integrated. Students receive further 
instruction in smaller groups by the Math Coach or the Math AIS provider. Graphic Organizers are used where appropriate. 
Native Language is used through translation, cognates, dictionaries, glossaries and the use of eBooks which are translated into 
Spanish through the MyOn website. Maggies' Earth Adventure/ spanish (math, reading, science and grammar). 
 
Targeted Interventions for ELLs in Social Studies are conducted through small group instruction, multiple pathways, graphic 
organizers, thinking maps, Common Core Learning Standards, Instructional Shifts and read alouds in the content area. 
Information is scaffolded in all content areas through the use of  thinking maps, graphic organizers, visuals, maps, glossaries 
and dictionaries. Students are also exposed to hands-on- activities and projects. The Home Language is accessible through the 
use of cognates, Spanish/English dictionaries and translation where applicable. 
 
Targeted interventions for ELLs in Science are administered through small group and multiple pathways, the Commom Core 
Learning Standards, Instructional Shifts, non fiction texts and other sources .   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  N/A 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There will be no discontinued program at P.S. 59.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
English Language Learners participate along the  entire monolingual population in the full schedule and programming. The 
schedule we function under is an integrated one. ELLs along with monolingual students participate in all subjects . There are no 
distinctions between ELLs and Non- ELLs when it comes to participation of activities or programming. This practice ensures a 
cultural understanding among students and personnel. The school ensures that the ELLs ' and non-ELLs' social, academic and 
emotional needs for that matter are addressed while participating in the programs of the school. The ENL Team also offers 
Supplemental Services for ELLs in the After School Program provided through the Title III Program. This service takes place 
after school once a week from  2:30-5:00. The goal of this program is to accelerate The English language through the use of 
many activities. This intervention takes place  through literacy in the content areas, hands-on activities in exploration, reading 
and writing which is incorporated in the social studies and science areas.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
• Accessibility to technology, which includes computers and audiovisual equipment is available and utilized in the classroom, 
laboratories and the library.  
• Newcomers use the Raz-kids Reading Program which combines basic vocabulary development with phonics-based beginning 
reading instruction to create integrated learning through technology. Students have access to Spanish songs and Rhymes, 
decodable books, ELL vocabulary books, high frequency word books, vocabulary and idiom books, alphabet books, read alouds, 
sound/symbol books, and poetry books. 
• Transitional students are assisted for two years. Students are placed in a Monolingual setting with ENL services on a weekly 
basis. Articulation among staff members, parent coordinator, school leadership and guidance counselor is ongoing throughout 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68 

 

the year to support ELLs. The guidance counselor's objective is for all students to achieve their  social and academic goals. The 
guidance program offers ELL students various approaches so they may acquire a sense of ease in all academic 
areas. Students encounter language barriers but the counselor along with the teachers, support, motivate  and encourage our 
students to achieve high standards. The guidance counselor presents ELL students with  a comprehensive guidance program 
which is an integral part of the overall school curriculum that includes Making and Keeping Friends, Respect Yourself and 
Others, Avoid and Prevent Bullying and Teasing,and  Identify Your Personal Strengths. 
 
Articulation is an integral part of the school program; it provides students and parents with information about new schools, 
offers parents and students support in completing applications, addresses questions and concerns as they arise and provides 
students with social support during the transition.   
 
Transitional students attend the After School program Expanded Learning Time (ELTNYC), which assists them in completing 
their assignments in all of the content areas: English Language Arts, Math, Science and Social Studies.   
 
The school Library has many native language materials available for students in different genres such as novels, fiction, social 
studies, science, biographies, glossaries and dictionaries. The Library also has the P.S.59Library.org link which has information 
in many languages on the left hand side of the home page of the library.         
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students’ level of literacy in the home language is taken into consideration by having materials in dual languages. Such 
materials include books, tapes and software. The use of the home language is  delivered in the ENL program through the use of 
dictionaries, glossaries, websites, cognates, books in both languages from the library and translation as appropriate. Required 
services, support and resources correspond to grade levels; these resources are research-based.   
Academic language development is planned during ENL and classroom teachers' articulation in Learning Team meetings or 
when the opportunity presents itself.  At these meetings, teachers plan content area objectives which coincide with the 
language objectives.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  Required services and resources correspond to  all ages and grade levels of the ELLs. English Language Learners at P.S. 59 
enter the grade needed based on their age level. P.S.59 follows the New York City Department of Education guidelines at the 
time of registration and promotion of English Language Learners. First time entrants' placement is based on their age. There 
are many things to take into consideration during the promotion or retention of ELLs. The limited English proficiency alone 
does not determine such decisions. The promotion criteria for newcomers (ELLs) (2 years or less) is not based solely on the 
English language development but on a holistic examination of each individuals' academic progress in addition to ENL, Social 
Studies, Science, Arts and Social development. English Language Learners receive the appropriate instruction based on their 
age and grade level through the classroom curricular materials in literacy, ENL, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science. All the 
required services and supports are again based on ELLs' age and grade level. P.S.59 utilizes the Common Core Learning 
Standards and Instructional Shifts with multiple pathways to ensure the academic rigor of instruction is in alignment with our 
educational goals. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
• Accessibility to technology, which includes computers and audiovisual equipment, is available and utilized in the classroom, 
laboratories and the library.  
• Newcomers use the Raz-kids Program which is a reading program that combines basic vocabulary development with phonics-
based beginning reading instruction; It  integrates learning through technology.  
• Transitional students are assisted for two years. Students are placed in a Monolingual setting with ENL services on a weekly 
basis. Articulation among staff members, parent coordinator, school leadership and guidance counselor is ongoing throughout

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 During orientations, which take place at the beginning of the school year, parents of newly enrolled ELLs are given pertinent 
information along with a tour of the school premises to make them feel welcomed. The ENL Coordinator, Parent Coordinator 
along with the Guidance Counselor ensure that the parents and students are aware of all the activities and programs available 
for them. At this time,  all other  concerns presented by the parent or student are addressed.  Students are also introduced 
to  pertinent personnel in order to provide social support during the transition.     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

         We do not offer a DL program at this moment. However, if the need arises one will be created. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The Professional Development plan for ENL providers and teachers of ELLs was disseminated through a series of 
workshops that took place over the course of the school year from September 2016 to June 2017. The workshops took place at 
Teachers College, the Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) and at our school on Monday afternoons during our professional 
development time. As of September 2016- June 2017, all teachers were able to acquire the necessary tools to develop and 
strengthen reading and writing skills in their students by attending the professional development offered at Teachers College. 
ENL teachers also  attended professional development by the DELLSS Department and other entities geared towards ELLs. 
They utilized the information gathered at these workshops to develop a plan to put into place with the ELLs. As of September 
2016-2017, ENL teachers also provided professional development at P.S. 59 to teachers who work with ELLs. Teachers were

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Classroom Teachers of ELLs  attended  PD given by the ENL Teachers which addressed the progression levels of ELLs and how 
to differentiate the common core curriculum for these students. Teachers of ELLs  also received a list of the ELL students in 
their class with their performance level on the 2016 NYSESLAT along with the number of years they have been in the program 
as well as any other pertinent information about the child.  The PD Entitled 'ELL Descriptors and Differentiation' focused on 
teachers aligning the ELL students in their class to the WIDA Descriptors and learning how to differentiate for these descriptors

in the content areas. We also distributed the WIDA Descriptors grades 3-5 and WIDA Focus on Differentiation Part I, May 2012 
WIDA Consortium. 
 
Our school makes sure that the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154, are met for teachers of ELLs and 
ENL teachers by coordinating Monday Afternoons and Staff Development Day PD with Ms. Basu, the Principal, the 
reading coach, grade leaders, coaches from Teachers College,  math consultant and  other staff developers. 
 
At the beginning of the school year, the administration team administers  the school calendar which  informs us of the 
professional developments being offered at Teachers College and dates of in house training and workshops. The 
administration team also forwards the staff emails in which we are informed of other workshops being offered outside the 
building such as those provided by  DELLSS, BFSC, or other entities offering pertinent information that would empower the 
staff at P.S. 59. 
 
All of the Professional Development provided to the staff at P.S. 59  was specifically aligned to the new requirements of CR 
Part 154 to assure complete compliance.  All attendance rosters, agendas, notes and handouts materials provided at these 
workshops are maintained in a binder by the reading coach.  The ENL coordinator maintains a binder as well. She keeps 
track of all the ENL workshops attended by the ENL team as well as those attended by teachers of ELLs. The math coach keeps 
another binder. This binder contains agendas of all the meetings that took place between the math consultant and the 
teachers. This instruction took place on a one-to-one basis or as a whole grade. Another binder is kept by the administration to 
keep track of all the professional training and workshops that have been provided to all the staff at P.S. 59.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our ENL teachers were available to meet with ELL Parents on Tuesdays from 2:20-3:00.  Parents of ELLs were requested to 
meet with their child’s ENL teacher at least once during the school year to discuss their child’s language development progress, 
results of the NYSESLAT, child’s language development in the content areas and the goals of the ENL program. Since the ENL 
teachers speak Spanish, they were able to provide translation for Spanish speakers. For all other languages, The Translation 
and Interpretation Unit Over-the-Phone translation service were used.  A letter written in the parent’s language of choice on 
school letterhead was sent home to invite the parent to the meeting. Parents unable to attend on a specified day and time 
were scheduled  through another letter or a phone call. In the event that the parent was unable to attend the meeting, a 
phone call conference was conducted.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our school offers many opportunities for our ELL parents to become involved in the school community. There is a 
PA President at our school who is very active in supporting the needs of our parents, students and the school. The PA President 
meets monthly during the evening and encourages all parents to become members and be active in their child's academic and 
social development. 
 
The Parent Coordinator empowers the parents at our school by providing them with workshops and family events. In order to 
help the parents feel that they are welcome and their input into their child's education is valued, the Parent Coordinator has 
established a connection between the school and families by offering monthly meetings with the principal entitled ' Coffee 
With the Principal'. 
 
Our school also offers ELL parents an After school ENL Program. This program teaches basic English language skills to our 
parents. There are several staff members who are bilingual in Spanish, French, Italian and Igbo languages who assist the

parents when the opportunity presents itself. 
 
We also have the Translation and Interpretation Unit services offered by the D.O.E to assist parents with written translation 
and over the phone interpretation services. Workshops are also provided on Tuesdays from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm. At these 
workshops parents are empowered by lessons modeled through ENL strategies such as the use of manipulatives to utilize at 
home while assisting their child with homework assignments. Reading tools are also administered so they may help reinforce 
and strengthen their child's reading skills at home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sita Basu, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and 
staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a parent enters our school building to register a student, the school secretary makes contact with the ENL 
Coordinator or trained pedagogue to quickly identify whether a language interpretation/translation service is 
required. Language interpretations can be provided by the school or the translation and interpretation unit. Upon 
evaluation by the ENL Coordinator, she determines whether the parent need further assistance with translation 
and or oral interpretation. If the parent does not speak Spanish the office makes contact with the translation and 
interpretation unit for further assistance. The ENL Coordinator, Parent Coordinator and most of the staff in the 
main office speak Spanish; which is the major language spoken at our school. They translate or interpret any 
information to that parent in Spanish. According to our data, the ATS reports, completed HILS forms and NYSITELL 
information shows that Spanish is the major language at P.S.059. Any letters sent from our school are also

provided in English and Spanish.Also other ways to collect data are ATS report of preferred languages , Blue card 
data, Parent Surveys, Teacher survey collected by class.           

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We use School Messenger to alert parents of emergencies. 

Parents receive notifications in both Spanish and English. 

The School App also sends out messages in English and Spanish when there are emergencies. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All staff will be made aware of Chancellors Reg A-663 as part of our opening meeting on 9/4/2018, when all of the 
Chancellors Regs are reviewed: 

 

As per the Regs, schools must determine within 30 (thirty) days of a student’s enrollment (or, for students already 
enrolled, by a date and procedure to be determined by the Office of Teaching and Learning) the primary language 
spoken by the parent of each student enrolled in the school, and if such language is not English, whether the parent 
requires language assistance in order to communicate effectively with the Department.  

The school shall maintain an appropriate and current record of the primary language of each parent. Such information 
must be maintained in ATS and on the student emergency card.  

Each school and office shall, consistent with this regulation, provide translation and interpretation services to all 
parents who require language assistance in order to communicate effectively with the Department.  

The Department may provide translation and interpretation services beyond those outlined in this regulation.  

Parents may choose to rely on an adult friend/companion or relative for language and interpretation services. 
Students and other children (minors under the age of 18) may not serve as interpreters for school staff and parents 
during any formal or informal meeting where student achievement and/or student conduct are discussed.  

Teachers are given copies of the Translation and Interpretation Unit phone numbers by the LAC and asked to connect 
with our LAC when they are in need of a translator . 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who requires language assistance services will receive 
a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. All written communication between the home and school is 
distributed in both English and Spanish. However, in special cases where the home language is not English or Spanish 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83 

 

we will utilize the resources-language translation and interpretation kit- that was provided by the Department of 
Education as much as possible to ensure that parents are notified about issues of safety and instruction in their Home 
Language. Copies of chancellor regulations A-663 will be made available to all staff and parents. A display at the lobby 
of the school will exhibit all the documentation of the Checklist of Notification Requirements and the pertinent 
documents will also be available at the main office and the security desk.  All notification documents can be found at 
the Translation and Interpretation Units intranet site. 
http://intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.       

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school will gather parent surveys at the beginning of the school year. Surveys will also focus on the quality and 
availability of translation and interpretation services. These surveys will help P.S.059 monitor the progress for these 
services. Parents of all languages will be asked to attend a meeting to gather feedback regarding best practices 
regarding services available for them.
