Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
School Receivership   
In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which 
established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new 
law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools 
that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two-
year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City 
Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed 
under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          5 

 
core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant 
interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close 
achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 
the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students.

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          6 

 
The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          7 

 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
  
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: Renewal School Narrative 

 

In a brief narrative, describe the current state of the Renewal school addressing the following:  

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

partners in furthering student achievement  

5.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the 

Framework for Great Schools and indicate where this has been a challenge. 

6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 

 

 

At the close of the 2016-2017 academic year, the Hunts Point MS (08X424) held the distinction of being amongst the 
lowest overall performing middle schools in New York State and on the persistently dangerous list. With the full 
support of the Chancellor’s Office and superintendent (district 8), 424 was re-branded in August 2017, and a school-
wide improvement plan was drafted and initiated four weeks later September 2017. 

The Bronx Academy for Multi-Media (BAMM!) school-wide improve plan rests on three cornerstones: 

(a) rebuild the instructional core,  

(b) reset the school’s tone, culture, and physical environment, and  

(c) transform the mindset of every adult practitioner in our learning community (growth v. fixed). 

How do students learn best? 

Highly effective instruction is the essential ingredient to close the achievement gap and cultivate high school, college 
and work-ready Scholar-Activists. Great teaching rarely, if ever, emerges in a vacuum, or by accident. Highly effective 
instruction is the product of well-trained, purposeful teachers and data-driven teacher teams adopting a common 
language (Danielson), sharing a common instructional philosophy and working in sync with an equally dedicated 
cohort of creative and constructive instructional leaders and coaches toward a manageable set of common, clear and 
S.M.A.R.T. goals. 

As a school and district, we embrace the "workshop model" across all grades and disciplines. Via the workshop 
model,  

 

Students learn best by doing i.e., tackling a succession of increasingly complex tasks and sitting at the center 
of the cognitive action as frequently as possible across the duration of a single or double instructional period. 

  Teachers are invited to teach/model, then gradually release students to grapple with a cognitively rigorous 

 

task independently and in purposeful groups. 
Student independence is cultivated by teachers manufacture opportunities for teachers to customize 
instruction and support; a particularly important characteristic given our relatively high, special needs 
populations across our MS (31% students with disabilities, 31% ELLs). 

  We practice our learning community’s (a) purposeful, ongoing, shift from teacher-centered, whole-group, 

instruction to student-centered, text-based, small group, collaborative instruction, and (b) increasing

providing students extended opportunities to critically read, write, speak, and problem solve across 
disciplines over the course of each instructional day. 

The increasing alignment of MS summative assessments with the common core instructional shifts demands we 
place a high premium on strengthening our students’ capacity to: (a) marshal text-based evidence, (b) understand 
increasingly complex concepts and vocabulary to successfully defend an oral and written argument, (c) establish 
authentic connections across multiple topics and disciplines, and (d) successfully apply their emerging skills and 
conceptual knowledge to simulations which replicate the highly dynamic, ambiguous, and unpredictable character 
of the “real world.” 

The ability to effectively summon evidence in written and verbal argument, for example, rests on a foundation of 
highly specific,. cognitively rigorous tasks or highly visible thinking routines that “stretch” students, cognitively 
speaking, create intellectually dynamic classroom environments, and ensure college and career readiness.  

So this year we’ve begun to guide faculty to include the following thinking routines in their daily instructional plan: 

  A close reading of engaging and increasingly complex fiction and non-fiction texts that requires students to 

 

underline and annotate 
Scaffolded questioning that requires students to reference text in their written and verbal responses and 
defend their point-of-view 

  Highly participatory, text-based classroom discussions in which students address and challenge one another 

as well as their teacher(s). 

Each of these thinking routines are partially assessed by CCLS-aligned tasks that demand students produce short and 
extended evidence-based, written responses in class and for HW. 

Our school-wide instructional focus this year is the following:  

In an effort to increase the number of students attaining a score of proficient (Level 3) or better by 10% in ELA and 
mathematics by June 2019, we will strengthen every teacher’s capacity to deliver targeted, small group instruction 
and increase every student’s ability to read critically, write well, speak clearly and independently problem solve. 

Planning & Refining Curricula 

Cognitive engagement is the direct by-product of well-planned, rigorous tasks presented in succession across all 
grades and subjects. “Task predicts performance.”[1] A primary objective of our department teams over the last eight 
months has been to strengthen the alignment of our ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science curricula with the CCLS 
to increase cognitive engagement and improve student performance on both the NYS ELA and Math standardized 
assessments; with an increased focus on our students with disabilities and ELLs; thus, ensuring rigorous instruction 
for all students. 

The BAMM! faculty are supervised by a designated Assistant Principal (AP) for Instruction, who along with the 
Principal, a part-time Literacy coach and an Instructional Coach for each core subject, are charged with providing 
timely, relevant and actionable feedback to faculty on their unit plans at the opening of each cycle (or marking 
period) and employing a widely circulated checklist of five essential components to support instructional coherence 
across all disciplines and each grade — sixth through eighth. 

BAMM’s instructional core rests on the following curricula unpacked and implemented last September 2017: 

  Teacher College (TC) Reading & Writing Curricula immerse students in a minimum of four (4) units of study 

inclusive of narrative, informational, poetry and argumentative writing within a 90-minute block of ELA 
instruction

          14 

 

  NYC DOE Passport to Social Studies curricula drives students to analyze and support arguments and their 
point of view by utilizing a blend of primary and secondary historical and literary texts inclusive of graphs, 
photographs, artwork and  

  NTN KEMS Mathematic curricula 
 

For science the Glencoe middle school Science curricula emphasizes inquiry and hands-on application of 
scientific concepts 

THE five (5) essential daily instructional components WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTED AND IMPLEMENTED 
ACROSS ALL CLASSROOMS. THEY ARE: 

1. Learning targets (LTs), which are standards-based aka CCLS-aligned lesson objectives, integrated throughout the 
lesson and posted prominently in the classroom, and written in highly accessible language to all students. 
 
2. A minimum of three (3) observable checks for understanding (CFUs) explicitly and seamlessly embedded in daily 
lesson plans. 

3. Scaffolds and supports for ELLs and students with disabilities (SWDs) included In the lessoN plan AND observable 
to the naked eye. 

 
4. The authentic and effective utilization of all paraprofessionals assigned to each class; particularly, with respect to 
supporting our SWDs (student with disabilities) and ELLs. 

5. Exit slips issued and attached to the lesson plan no fewer than three times per week. 

Each of these five expectations are in direct service of providing every student a steady diet of cognitively rigorous 
tasks across all subjects that place premiums on: 

 

close and critical reading of non-fiction and fiction texts that includes every student underlining and 
annotating. 
student-to-student text and/or evidence-based discussions, 
text or evidence-based extended written responses composed by each student independently, and 

 
 
  opportunities for students to apply the aforementioned cognitive skills in the service of addressing 

authentic, "real world" challenges. 

IT'S ALL ABOUT RIGOR AND RELEVANCE. 

In addition to the exit slips referenced above, we ADMINISTER THE following interim assessments quarterly TO 
TRACK AND MONITOR all students' performance AND GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR: 

I-Ready ELA and Math DIAGNOSTIC BENCHMARK; 3x/yr 

Teachers College performance-based assessments, I.E. BASELINE AND ENDLINE, ON-DEMAND WRITING PROMPTS; 
3x/yr 

NTN KEMS pre- and post-unit assessments; approx. 6-10x/yr 

Fountas & Pinnell running records; 3x/yr 

ReadyNY INSTRUCTION post assessment; varies per student

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
Our school-wide instructional focus this year is the following:  

In an effort to increase the number of students attaining a score of proficient (Level 3) or better by 10% in ELA and 
mathematics by June 2019, we will strengthen every teacher’s capacity to deliver targeted, small group instruction and 
increase every student’s ability to read critically, write well, speak clearly and independently problem solve. 

The end of each unit, or cycle will culminate in a performance task which challenges students to:  

(a) grapple with an authentic challenge or "real world" problem, operating in ways similar to adults outside,  

(b) apply knowledge and skills Presented and prioritized in the unit,  

(c) share their learning with audiences that could benefit from their learning, and 

(d) reflect upon their learning and partake in peer and self assessment. 

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
BAMM! Scholar-Activist mission is to prepare every young scholar we serve to (a) succeed in high school and college, (b) 
thrive in the 21st century economy, and (c) leave a lasting, positive impact on her/his home and school communities. 

We actualize the Scholar-Activist mission by immersing our young scholars daily in a highly customized and supportive, 
values-based, college preparatory learning environment which places the highest premium on strengthening their 
critical reading skills, text-based writing, public speaking skills and independent problem solving across the curriculum.  

Our comprehensive vision for school improvement in respect to rigorous instruction entails the following components: 

1. Introduce CCLS-aligned curricula across all four core content areas. 

ELA: Teachers College Reading & Writing 

Math: KEMS by National Training Network (NTN) 

Social Studies: Passport to Social Studies (NYCDOE) 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
138 

 

 

 

          

 

Science: Glencoe middle school science curriculum aligned to national and NYS Next Generation P-12 Science Standards 
and NYCDOE's Science scope-and-sequence 

2. Provide job-embedded Instructional Specialist coaching and modeling in each core content area to support the 
thoughtful unpacking, customization, pacing and execution of the aforementioned CCLS-aligned curricula in light of 
our school-wide learning expectations and instructional norms. 

3. Embed 90-minutes of common planning time, by discipline/department, within the school day, once a week. 
Weekly common planning time devoted to: 

(a) ongoing rounds of unit/lesson study, 

(b) studying student work, 

(c) sharing effective classroom practices, and 

(d) launching multiple rounds of peer classroom visitations. 

4. Introduce a common lesson planning template,a school-wide grading policy and incorporate "SMART Board" 
instructional technology. 

5. Re-design extended learning time (ELT) and introduce ENRICHMENT HOUR, which includes 2 days of independent 
reading, I day of Scholar-Activist Life-skills Building, a day of Extended Math Problem Solving and Flocabulary Fridays.  

6. Utilize the i-Ready computer-adaptive assessment tool and reports to form strategic groupings and provide 
appropriate and authentic scaffolds and supports for ELLs and SWDs. 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
B.A.M.M. students are immersed in the traditional academic core subjects eight periods a day, five days a week.  

  Ten 45-minute periods of ELA 
  Ten 45-minute periods of Math 
 
 
  2-3 45-minute periods of Art 
  2-3 45-minute periods of PE/Health 

Five 45-minute periods of Social Studies 
Five 45-minute periods of Science 

Additionally, students are immersed in any number of extended learning time offerings, 2-4 times per week, 75-minutes 
each day. 

Fine Art 

 
  Elevate NY Leadership 
  ENL Enrichment 
  Theater 
  Rock the Boat 
  Holistic PE & Mindfulness 
  HW Help 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

Each core offering supports the acquisition of content and "real-world" knowledge by exposing students to vocabulary 
and increasingly complex academic tasks and texts (CCLS ELA Instructional Shifts 2, 3, and 6). There is also an 
expectation that students are challenged to partake evidence-based conversations with one another and on an ongoing 
basis (Shift 4) and marshal evidence from text and evidence-based sources to inform both verbal and written arguments 
(Shifts 4 and 5). 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
Students learn best when the sit in the center of cognitive action. Our school-wide expectation is that all faculty, across 
each core content area, will execute the components of workshop model to fidelity-- inclusive of a mini lesson, 
independent practice and share. 

  The mini lesson, when executed effectively, provides students explicit, teacher-centered, instruction that (a) 

presents the unit's essential question and lesson's learning target (LT), (b) introduces academic vocabulary, (c) 
shares a model or mentor text, (d) models a specific text-based reading, writing, speaking, or problem skill, and 
(d) checks for student understanding. 
Independent practice, the heart of the model, provides an opportunity for customized, or differentiated 
instruction, through a blend of one-on-one conferencing, targeted small group instruction, based in formative 
assessment station work, and independent work time. 

 

  The share serves the dual function of a recap, or opportunity to revisit the lesson's EQ(s) and LT(s), and check 

for understanding by welcoming students to share their learning in written and/or verbal form. 

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
Independent practice, the heart of the workshop model, provides an opportunity for customized, or differentiated 
instruction, through a blend of one-on-one conferencing, small group instruction, station work, and independent work 
time on a daily basis in all core content areas.  

Select extended learning time opportunities (ELTs), including Integrated Algebra, ELA & Math enrichment, ENL support, 
for example, provide select students customized enrichment and remediation opportunities twice a week, or 150 total 
minutes. 

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?

4b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Our caregivers and families remain BAMM’s most valuable and loyal partners. We’ve taken the following steps to 
strengthen our ties with families and the community: 

  We utilize Skedula to improve communication and collaboration between parents, students, teachers, and 

school leaders and support each student’s ability to self-monitor her/his academic progress 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
162 

 

 

 

          

 

  District 8’s Family Support and Leadership Coordinators provide on-going, hands-on, support for our newly 

elected Parent Association (PA) and PA president 

  Parent Coordinator (PC) partakes in monthly district-wide PDs and works closely with administration, district 

liaisons, our PA president, elected representatives, and CBO partners to strengthen outreach to families 
  Our PC, community school partner, ASPIRA of NY, and Advisors utilize the following vehicles to maintain 

open lines of communication with caregivers and families: monthly phone calls home, coupled with school-
wide “robo” calls, text communications and quarterly parent-student-teacher conferences 

  Utilize our Community Engagement Team (CET) to increase our capacity to effectively devise and assess the 

means by which we engage BAMM! parents and caregivers.  

The impact of these measures are collected on a blend of digital and paper-based platforms and readily available to 
review upon request. 
  

 
Part 5 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 5a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, lead CBO’s community school budget, etc. 
The following resources will be used as leverage to achieve this goal: 

● Scheduling will include teacher planning, department and grade meeting times 

● Human resources from within our school (teachers, administration, cabinet, and additional staff) and community 
(parents and CBO)as well as other partners (Generation Ready, and IDE) 

 
Part 5b. Indicate using an “X” the fund source(s) that will be utilized to support achievement of the specified goal.

Part 6 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 6a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound. 
By February 2019, 40% of all students will demonstrate an increase of 1 level from the first Writing Unit of Study on-
demand, END-LINE writing prompt to the second Writing Unit of Study on-demand, END-LINE writing prompt using 
the Writing Pathways, Performance Assessments and Learning Progressions by Lucy Calkins. 

The learning progressions describe development in three aspects of writing: structure, development, and language 
conventions. These progressions are meant to show the path writers take moving step by step along a continuum of 
development. 

The rubrics stem from the learning progressions and allow teachers to score a piece of writing, based on the 
corresponding grade level expectations. Rubric scoring is done by adding up scores from components of a student's 
writing to find a raw score, then converting that raw score into a scaled score. 

All student data will be dissaggreagted by grade, class, sub group and aspect of writing comparing the END-LINE 
administered in October 2018 with the same administered in Decemeber 2018.

Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Each of BAMM!'s five school-wide instructional expectations referenced above are in direct service of providing 
every student a steady diet of cognitively rigorous tasks across all subjects that place premiums on: 

 

close and critical reading of non-fiction and fiction texts that includes every student underlining and 
annotating. 
student-to-student text and/or evidence-based discussions, 
text or evidence-based extended written responses composed by each student independently, and 

 
 
  opportunities for students to apply the aforementioned cognitive skills in the service of addressing 

authentic, "real world" challenges. Think relevance. 

In addition to the exit slips referenced above, we presently rely upon the following interim assessments for quarterly 
student performance data: I-Ready ELA and Math, Teachers College performance based assessments, NTN KEMS 
pre- and post-unit assessments, Fountas & Pinnell running records, ReadyNY workbook post assessment, and 
teacher-created mid-term and final exams correlated with the NYS ELA and Math power standards and standardized 
summative assessments. 

The impact of these measures has been collected on a blend of digital and paper-based platforms that will be readily 
available to the reviewer upon request. 
  
Part 6c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Based on the results of the 2018 DTSDE the school received ratings of developing and ineffective for 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 
5.5. However, adjustments have been made this year in SOPs 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 which enabled the school to show 
improvements as developing as based on our 2018 Quality Review results as follows: 

5.2 The Leadership Group provides a curriculum that supports young people’s social and emotional learning (SEL) that 
involves all adults in the school via our school's Advisory program. The Advisory curriculum offers lessons to improve 
social and emotional skills, attitudes, behavior, college and career, and academic performance. Providing students with 
Advisory in an attempt to foster, and develop a foundation for increased social adjustment, and academic performance 
should result in more positive social behaviors, fewer conduct problems, less emotional distress, and improved test 
scores and grades. Within the advisory space we utilize several researched-based curriculum aimed at improving the five 
core Social and Emotional Competencies:  

1.  Self-awareness 
2.  Self-management 
3.  Social-awareness 
4.  Relationship skills and 
5.  Responsible decision-making 

5.3 Because of the unique level of poverty, homelessness and unemployment rate within the Hunts Point Community, 
our Leadership Group has worked to form partnerships and deployed intentional human capitals to attend to these 
historical needs. As a result we have hired hired guidance counselors, social workers and have also partnered with 
Graduate Schools of Social Work (Hunter and Adelphi) to provide social work interns to address the social, emotional 
and mental health of our students and families. Additionally we have partnered with two clinical agencies within our 
school to provide clinical and psychiatric services to students and families. These two agencies are Urban Health that 
operates a full clinic in our school as well as Astor Services for Children and Families that provides clinical counseling. 
The school uses PBIS to reward young scholars that are complying with our scholar-activist community practices such as: 

  Meeting or exceeding our school-wide daily attendance goal of 92% 
  Arriving to school on time and prepared to learn 
  Completing homework, class work and projects thoughtfully and timely 
  Honoring our dress-cope policy of the seventh graders wearing navy blue shirt and eighth graders white shirt 
 

co-creating a safe learning environment with teachers, parents, faculty and the school leadership where all 
students feel a sense of belonging 

These values are taught and promoted in all learning spaces within our school community including classroom, hallways, 
grade level community meetings and within counseling spaces.  

5.4 The principal and teachers have developed a clear vision to prevent and deescalate negative social behaviors 
through the implementation of the Student Support Team, utilizing Restorative practices that will impact student 
behavior, their social and emotional competency, their academic performance, resulting in a better classroom climate 
for learning. Additionally, the SIT, Counseling Team, Student Support Team, cabinet and Advisory Team are 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
250 

 

 

 

          

 

representative of the entire school community, and meet on a weekly basis to set goals, monitor progress, discuss 
challenges, and plan next steps in improving our social-emotional progress. This is especially evident with our weekly 
case conference meeting with the Student Support Team, Guidance and counseling team that meet and develop 
behavioral support plan for students that need additional academic and behavioral support. We are intentional in 
having the above stakeholders at these important meetings so as to ensure that students have access to wrap around 
services aimed at promoting SEL well being.  

5.5 This academic year our principal has been intentional in hiring support staff to support each grade band to monitor 
hallways and classroom environments as well as provide students and teachers will support within those spaces. The 
Student Support Team and Assistant Principals work closely with teachers to norm rituals and routines for students from 
the first day of school. Nuts and bolts around classroom management and escalation techniques are covered in 
professional development sessions with teachers and classroom para-professionals. We also work closely with our SFC 
in district 8 to conduct Emotional First Aide and Therapeutic Crisis Intervention in Schools (TCIS) training. 

These students will meet regularly with the Principal/Assistant Principals and the Community School Director to support 
efforts to address social-emotional, developmental, and academic needs. The school uses RTI - Multi-Tier System to 
support and prioritize the needs of our young people as seen in anecdotal, teacher referrals, attendance records, and 
shared parent concerns. Professional development surrounding the restorative approach to discipline will be provided 
to all teachers, staff members, students and parents. The goal is to continue to articulate procedures, systems, and 
accountability for all stakeholders. 

Our goal is to leverage our building-wide resources and partnerships to find solutions to reduce the amount of young 
people having re-occurring incidents. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
As a Community School, we believe that our school environment needs to be supportive, creating culture and climate 
that makes all young people feel safe and prepared to embrace the challenges of learning. Our ASPIRA partnership is 
truly a seamless extension of our school, embracing our mission, vision and instructional foci. They will continue to 
provide numerous supports for programming, curriculum, social emotional development, extracurricular activities, and 
advanced placement learning opportunities.  

Student voice and leadership will be cultivated and heard through the Student Government, our Student Support 
Center, PBIS Team and the SLT. 

The school will continue to have clear rules and consequences for all young people as measured through the 
Chancellor's Regulations and Code of Student Conduct. The school will continue to have high expectations for teachers 
and young people as collaboratively created in the staff and student handbooks.  

Our focus is to strengthen the engagement and participation of parents through intensive parental involvement, 
training, and organized activities to meet the goal. Our mission is to enable parents to be proactive problem solvers, to 
engage in effective decision making, to partner with our school, and to become advocates for their children’s 
educational and social needs.  

Our goal is to increase attendance by four percent and decrease serious OORS incidents by 50%.  

The Instructional Cabinet along with the Culture and Climate Team will use and analyze a wide range of data sources to 
develop intervention plans to address the needs of our young people. These data sources will include progress reports, 
report cards, standardized tests, informal assessments, behavioral intervention plans, conduct sheets, teacher/parent 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
251 

 

 

 

          

 

/student rating scales, screening data, classroom observations, behavioral logs, disciplinary referrals, and attendance 
data. 

And, finally, we've re-launched Assertive Discipline PD to strengthen the daily classroom management of novice and 
veteran faculty alike.(September 2018). This PD will continue for the duration of the 2018-2019 academic year. 

To improve the culture and climate at Bronx Academy For Multi-Media (BAMM!), we will develop and strengthen the 
following program delivery to staff and students: Advisory for all students, weekly Community Meetings and Elevate . 
During the winter semester, 7th and 8th grade students will be trained in conflict resolution and peer mediation. In the 
spring, students will co-facilitate mediation sessions with counseling team and dean team.  

 

 

Who are your CBO partners? How will each CBO sustain and support the social-emotional and academic growth of 
your students? 

CBO Partner 

ASPIRA 

ASPIRA will play an intergal part in sustaining and supporting the social-emotional and academic 
growth of our students by focusing attendance, student and family food insecurity and school-
wide student behavior management. 

CBO Focus 

Elevate New York (NY)  Elevate New York is a high-quality youth development program accredited by the NYC 

Department of Education that supports our weekly Scholar-Activist Skills Building ENRICHMENT 
HOUR programming. Via Elevate NY students learn about character, quality and life skills.

make a difference in the lives of children, youth and families who are overcoming some of life’s 
most difficult challenges and obstacles. Monday through Saturday, they run after-school and 
weekend programs and create a safe and loving family-like atomosphere so all students in our 
community may have the opportunity and preparation to thrive in school and in the world. 

Graham Windham 

  
 

How will you in partnership with your CBO will create a supportive environment and engagement for your students’ 
families? 
Parent and community workshop offerings will be provided on our Positive Behavior Intervention System. Our Culture 
and Climate Team will meet weekly to discuss socio-emotional strategies students will utilize to deescalate conflict and 
how all staff will receive training and work together. Additionally, because our school is a community school, our 
building is open until 9:00 PM in the evening. This allows us to provide after-school enrichment to our students as well 
as educational program like GED classes to our families.  

 

 
Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact

implementation and oversight. 
Our caregivers and families remain BAMM’s most valuable and loyal partners. We’ve taken the following steps to 
strengthen our ties with families and the community: 

  We utilize Skedula to improve communication and collaboration between parents, students, teachers, and 

school leaders and support each student’s ability to self-monitor her/his academic progress.  

  District 8’s Family Support and Leadership Coordinators provide on-going, hands-on, support for our newly 

elected Parent Association (PA) and PA president. 

  Parent Coordinator (PC) partakes in monthly district-wide PDs and works closely with administration, district 

liaisons, our PA president, elected representatives, and CBO partners to strengthen outreach to families. 
  Our PC, community school partner, ASPIRA of NY, and Advisors utilize the following vehicles to maintain 

open lines of communication with caregivers and families: monthly phone calls home, coupled with school-
wide “robo” calls, text communications, quarterly parent-student-teacher conferences. 

The impact of these measures has been collected on a blend of digital and paper-based platforms that will be readily 
available to the reviewer upon request.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices 
and Decisions) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 4 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized 

around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs. 

4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards 

(CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning 

environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths 
and needs of all students. 

4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by 

using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures, 
and progress monitoring).

Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Based on the SOP's selected above, the school has made adjustments for the 2018-2019 school year in order to show 
improvements in these areas, as proficient, based on our 2018 Quality Review as well as our June Instructional Report. 
These adjustments will be made to address the needs of our students through teaching practices that include, planning 
coherent instruction with an emphasis on questioning and discussion and the use of formative assessment data in order 
to increase student engagement within our classrooms.  

4.2 – In collaboration with our partners, Teachers College, NTN, Teaching Matters, the coaches will continue the work 
begun in supporting and exposing teachers to practices around developing and utilizing standards-based subject units of 
instruction. Through programming, a double period, subject specific weekly common planning block will be 
implemented throughout the year. During teacher common planning periods, teachers will use student data to make 
unit adjustments, plan assessments and analyze student work/data trends. A New Faculty Institute will be implemented 
bi-monthly to support our new teaching staff. Beginning in September 2017, there will be a Peer Collaborative Coach in 
the Math department who will lead department teams in planning units, lessons, assessments, and addressing student 
goals. A model classroom will be utilized in order for our PCT to model and share best practices in supporting our 
teaching staff through differentiated professional development.  

·4.3 – Since January 2016, teachers have been implementing the Teachers College Writing Workshop with some fidelity 
in ELA. Continuous work needs to happen surrounding multiple entry points and providing access for all students. The 
coaching partners and in-house coach will continue to work with teachers on differentiation, and professional 
development. During common planning, teachers will analyze daily formative assessments to target specific learning 
trends in order to provide multiple entry points for upcoming lessons. We will continue to support our teachers 
implementing this information within their lesson in the form of scaffolded instruction and student grouping and 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

regrouping. We will continue to work with our content specific coaches and PCT, as well as provide differentiated staff 
professional development surrounding the use of scaffolded tasks to meet the needs of our students.  

4.4 – In collaboration with the partners mentioned above, as well as with anticipated support from Teachers College, 
and in-house coaches, the learning environment will be constantly reviewed. Our administration, coaching staff and PCT 
will be supporting teachers in creating a learning environment through the implementation of our Teacher College 
Writing curriculum, the National Training Network's KEMS program in Math and the implementation of our hands on 
science curriculum, LabAides. . Lit Life's Core Ready reading program will also be used as the ELA reading curriculum 
beginning September 2018. These programs will be monitored and supported by coaches and administration through 
regular communication, our subject specific common planning times and differentiated staff professional development 
to ensure our programs are tailored to the strengths and needs of our students.  

4.5 – Continuing this year teachers will implemented pre/post unit assessment practices, and Teachers College on-
demand writing assessments. After analyzing the pre-assessment data, teachers will be able to inform their planning, 
purposefully group, as well as, plan differentiated activities. Additionally, teachers will use daily formative assessments 
(such as exit slips, quizzes, etc.) to monitor and measure growth and provide feedback for planning purposes during 
their common planning blocks. Additional benchmark assessments, such as iReady for ELA and Math, paper Ready for 
ELA and Math, as well as interim subject specific assessments will be given throughout the year. The use of Skedula and 
Datacation will also be instrumental in students’ self-monitoring of their progress, as well as keeping parents abreast of 
their child’s academic progress. This data will be used in class for students to analyze in order to set their own personal 
subject specific goals, which will be monitored by the student throughout the unit and reassessed at the end of each 
unit.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

The school uses the workshop model for teaching and learning, with blended learning and technology tucked in. Teacher 
teams will use a weekly student focused common planning block to revise units and lessons based on students' writing 
samples across content areas with a focus on citing evidence to support one's ideas. The school’s core values will be 
used to aid in revising units along with alignment to state standards and the Grades 6-8 scope and sequence for social 
studies (Passport) and science (Lab Aides). 

The school has a protocol and safety intervention ladder of referral. The protocol begins with classroom interventions, 
counseling to mediate any scholar misunderstandings as an attempt to refocus the scholars, and culminating, if 
necessary in a Dean’s referral. The school community, including parents, the deans, counselors, social workers and 
administration is kept in the safety information loop through teacher's postings to Skedula. We have hired a full time 
Assistant Principal whose specialty is social emotional work. 

The focus for data review will be regular and ongoing beginning with reviewing and synthesizing data (pre/post unit 
assessments, Beginning of Year MOSL iReady, item analysis from state examinations, and in class assessments, such as 
running records, conference notes, scholar products, exit slips) unit/lesson development, inquiry-based activity 
planning, and revising (as necessary), lesson and activity planning.  

Teachers will identify a focus group of scholars that crosses grades and includes all subgroups to assess school academic 
needs, plan lessons, assess scholar outcomes, and revise craft moves; this will be done in a cyclical process using a 
protocol agreed upon by teachers within the specific content area teams (ELA, math, social studies, science, Special 
Education, ENL).  

The school will continue to work toward having department teams engaged in the practices described. Through sources 
such as Engage NY, professional development, coaches and aforementioned curriculum programs, creating model 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
258 

 

 

 

          

 

classrooms and encouraging inter-visitation along with using the challenge of the Common Core standards, instruction 
will deepen and become differentiated to meet the needs of scholars. The work will be done through the collaboration 
of teachers, with the support of the administration, Borough Field Support Center Instructional Specialists and an 
external instructional coach and ASPIRA 

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
The Instructional Cabinet will improve teacher practice and student learning via distributive leadership. The 
instructional cabinet will collectively bring problems and issues to the table and make decisions. Curriculum and 
assessments will constantly be reviewed during our Instructional Cabinet and adjustments will be made as needed.

When analyzing student data, this makes instructional next steps clear. Teachers will use this information within their 
teacher teams to inform their instruction, resulting in meeting the needs of their specific students, creating lessons with 
specific scaffolds, planning for authentic questioning and discussions as well as grouping and regrouping students to 
increase student engagement. Through this analysis of student data and tailoring their lessons as needed, it is our belief 
that student learning will increase.  

 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
Specific teacher leaders across teacher teams will meet weekly in the Instructional Cabinet to share updates on student 
learning and teaching practices. Additionally, teachers across teacher teams will meet to collaborate on cross curricular 
units and assignments during professional development.  

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.) 

Intent 

Ensure all lessons include multiple entry points and targeted, small group instruction is planned 
for daily. Modify/adapt curricula to ensure the students' learning needs are being met 

Instructional Leadership Team will analyze teachers' Advance data to plan for professional 
learning, reinforce key, school-wide instructional strategies and aanlyze if PLC impacting not 
only teacher practice but all student outcomes 

Get feedback from teachers and confirm or disconfirm if professional learning useful, timely and 
relevant; consider next steps and/or revise PL Plan

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Our caregivers and families remain BAMM’s most valuable and loyal partners. We’ve taken the following steps to 
strengthen our ties with families and the community: 

  We utilize Skedula to improve communication and collaboration between parents, students, teachers, and 

school leaders and support each student’s ability to self-monitor her/his academic progress.  

  District 8’s Family Support and Leadership Coordinators provide on-going, hands-on, support for our newly 

elected Parent Association (PA) and PA president. 

  Parent Coordinator (PC) partakes in monthly district-wide PDs and works closely with administration, district 

liaisons, our PA president, elected representatives, and CBO partners to strengthen outreach to families. 
  Our PC, community school partner, ASPIRA of NY, and Advisors utilize the following vehicles to maintain 

open lines of communication with caregivers and families: monthly phone calls home, coupled with school-
wide “robo” calls, text communications, quarterly parent-student-teacher conferences. 

The impact of these measures has been collected on a blend of digital and paper-based platforms that will be readily 
available to the reviewer upon request. 
  

 
Part 5 – Budget and Resource Alignment

Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound. 
By February 2019, teachers will have completed three (3) pre and post assessments that represents all scholar 
subgroups using TC Writing as the measurement. We will also use iReady Diagnostic Benchmark #2 in reading and 
math to assess our mid-year progress. 

By February 2019, all students, including three major sub groups at BAMM! - ELLs, SWDs, and STH - will demonstrate 
quarterly gains as measured by TC and NTN performance tasks, i-Ready Diagnostic Benchmark performance and ELA 
and Math BAMM! Quarterly results. 

 
Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
At weekly Instructional Cabinet Meetings and quarterly commonly planning meetings, the principal and the 
Instructional APs will review the following: (a) Advance data with a targeted emphasis on components 1A, 1E, and 3C, 
(b) disaggregated results of TC and NTN summative units, (c) I-Ready data and (d) ELA and Math quarterly results.

2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable, 

Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive 
of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (RSCEP). 
Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital 
resources. 

2.3 

2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 

Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and 
track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback. 

2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve critical 
individual and school-wide practices as defined in the RSCEP (student achievement, curriculum 
and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement; and student 
social and emotional developmental health).

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Based on the results of the 2018 DTSDE the school received ratings of developing and ineffective for 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 
2.5. However, adjustments have been made to this year in SOP 2.2 which enabled us to show consistency and maintain 
gains achieved as based on our 2018 Quality Review results as follows : 

● 2.2 - According to the 2016 Quality Review Report “Administrators consistently communicate high expectations for 
achievement and success by students and are developing systems by which staff can be trained and held accountable 
for such goals…” The school has an extended cabinet comprised of a variety of staff/ stakeholders that make up its 
school community which, along with the staff development committee (SDC) members review school accountability 
data, and use it to assess strengths and needs as outlined in the RSCEP. The school community generated a motto / 
‘core values’. The core values are: Trust, Accountability, Bravery, Perseverance, and Integrity. The cabinet will continue 
to improve by seeking to closely monitor the highlighted areas cited as developing, and revise approaches not yielding 
expected results.  

● 2.3 - Members of the SDC review a variety of school accountability data (city and state included), share this analysis, 
implications, and suggestions with members of the extended cabinet, administration, the school leadership team, and 
other community stakeholders. After reviewing the contributions, administration then decides how to best organize 
programs, human and fiscal resources. A part of each Monday’s professional development is set aside to share these 
decisions and get feedback from the school learning community. A vision board was created as a constant visual 
reminder of the school’s focus. Administration will continue to develop and hone its craft in seeking to be increasing

proficient with Galaxy, and utilizing benchmarks to track fiscal expenditures (grants and school funding), in an effort to 
maximize budget dollars to support the school community and scholar achievement . 

● 2.4 – Administration shares the responsibility of conducting observations and providing feedback to teachers, using 
the DOE Advance system. Observations are not just held to the regulated amount of formal and informal observations 
mandated, but include additional feedback that cycles back to support identified instructional concerns. (outside of the 
DOE mandate) in efforts to support improved teacher practice. The observation data is one of the sources that drive the 
work of the staff development committee (SDC) which in turn plans the targeted support teachers receive. Engaging 
scholars in learning is an area of focus with teacher practice. Going forward, additional and targeted support will be 
provided to improve the effectiveness of teachers in order to evidence authentic standards-aligned instruction which 
will result in differentiated work products to improve scholar engagement. 

2.5 – The school has the following evidence-based systems to examine and improve individual and school-wide practices 
as defined in the RSCEP:  

Student achievement, curriculum and teacher practices:  

● NYS ELA and mathematics Item Data Analysis 

● MOSL 

● Schoolnet 

● DataCation 

● Pre/post unit assessment 

● Other class and student work products 

Leadership development: 

● Administration attend and participate in on all professional development provided to staff and facilitated by partners 
and other vendors 

● DOE, union and other outside school professional development are selectively chosen for attendance by 
administration 

● Feedback by Principal to AP’s and from Superintendent to Principal are adhered to via Goals and Objectives and PPO 

● Administration also adheres to feedback provided from state, city, school accountability tool reports like (QR, SQR, IIT) 

Community/family engagement; and  

Student social and emotional developmental health: 

● Skedula 

● OORS 

● Teacher anecdotal and incident reports 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

● Child Study Team (CST) and the referral process and forms 

● IEP / SESIS and School Based Support Team (SBST) process 

● PBIS  

The school realizes that more support is needed to improve how the data is analyzed used to inform instructional next 
steps of teachers and scholars. 

The overall leveraged need is to improve the effectiveness of teachers within the instructional core components of the 
teacher evaluation system (ADVANCE): 1e-Designing Coherent Curriculum, 3b-Questions and Discussion techniques, 3c- 
Engaging Students In Learning, 3d- Using Assessments In Instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

The principal shares his vision with all stakeholders on a regular basis. 

We will continue to utilize a shared calendar between the principal and assistant principals to organize our classroom 
visits, and work with Advance to provide accurate, timely and actionable feedback to all teachers. The data collected 
during these observations will help in developing professional development trainings geared towards areas in which the 
school community shows where growth is needed. 

The principal regularly meets and discusses personal objectives, growths and next steps with assistant principals, both 
formally and informally. In our weekly cabinet meetings, the Principals Weekly is reviewed and responsibilities are 
parceled out in an attempt to build internal leadership capacity. 

 

On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year? 
Distributive Leadership 

 

What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s 
vision, mission, and instructional focus?

Based on the results of the 2018 DTSDE the school received ratings of ineffective for 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5. 

However, adjustments have been made this year in SOPs 6.2, 6.3, and 6.5 which enabled us to show gains achieved after 
noted as developing as based on our 2018 Quality Review results as follows: 

6.2, 6.3 and 6.5 – According to the 2018 Quality Review Report “Administrators consistently communicate high 
expectations for achievement and success by students and are developing systems by which staff can be trained and 
held accountable for such goals and parents can be given feedback regarding student progress toward those goals.” The 
school offers parents weekly opportunities to have reciprocal communication when attending parent engagement 
Tuesdays. This is where teachers engage in communicating to parents the high expectations of the school from a menu 
of items; thus sharing scholar academic and socio-emotional progress. Parents then can share how best the children 
learn and what they feel they can do at home to support the cause. Report cards are given four (4) times a year. Parents 
have access to Skedula’s Pupil Path system which is used to enter grades, post anecdotals, and communicate through e-
mail between staff and guardians. The school has a strong Parent Coordinator that is involved in the community, and 
attends the CEC meetings to share and disseminate information discussed at the meetings. The PC also plans ESL Parent 
Workshops using computer technology, and exposes parents to the Common Core, all in support of helping parents to 
help their children meet the communicated high expectations. The schools administration, parent coordinator, and 
parent association president all have open door policies to enable parents the opportunity to have in person 
discussions. ASPIRA, our PC and PA will collaborate with other stakeholders within the school to see how opportunities

can be improved to ensure regular and increased communication is evidenced to help parents assist their children meet 
academic and socio-emotional milestones.  

However, the following SOP remains an area of challenge: 

6.4 – The school has a variety of data sources (attendance, academic and socio-emotional) that teachers and school 
make available to parents in support of empowering families to understand the expectation and process it takes for a 
scholar to succeed. Although the above three (3) statements of practice showcases a variety of things the school is doing 
to evidence reciprocal communication of high expectations in support of parent engagement and scholar learning 
success, the school continues to struggle around maintaining current contact information and effective ways to have 
increased parent involvement. Lastly, increasing support needs to be placed on how best to support parent / members 
of the community around their housing and health related concerns. 

The school’s overall leveraged need is to develop effective strategies to support, and successfully navigate parent / 
community interactions, while providing interest driven activities, which would increase parent involvement in the 
school leading to greater scholar academic progress. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

Through our partnership with ASPIRA we will provide a greater range of services to our families, community and 
students. Provide and communicate weekly structured time for teachers to meet one on one with parents ·Develop and 
expand parent leadership through the Parent Teacher Association, participation on the BAMM Community School Team 
and School Leadership Team. Development of the BAMM Webpage and facebook like page to help communicate 
through social media with parents. All postings will be bilingual. Monthly school based and BAMM Community School 
Newsletter and school events calendar will be sent home via backpacks, email and traditional USPS mailings. Continued 
usage of an email & text blast list utilizing "School Messenger"and a electronic mass parent email group. The 
development of Parent Cohort groups to help better manage grade level events and locate and provide resources to 
parent the needs of their grade level cohort of parents. Through the use of a BAMM Webpage parents will be able to 
create and engage with other parents through discussion groups and platforms and parent blogs. 

ASPIRA and the school will plan activities that give families information around the concept of the school as a 
Lighthouse. Information will also be provided that outlines ASPIRA’s partnership with the school, and the school’s 
mission and vision. School safety officers will be a part of the roll out and information sessions to define their expanding 
role in the school community.  

Workshops and hands-on demonstrations will be offered to families that outline the expectations of the common core, 
the school’s shift to a humanities-based lens, inquiry work, and the expanded learning time initiative. There will also be 
literature and website information (including DOE) provided so that families can do further research on their own. 

In collaboration with ASPIRA, the school will create a Parent Welcome Center outfitted to meet the needs of parents. 
Parents will be invited in to volunteer and to participate in school activities. Parents will be supported by the staff being 
open, welcoming and knowledgeable of the procedures of the school. Parents will also be encouraged to attend CEC 
meetings and citywide trainings. In addition, the school will continue its collaboration with Mercy College who provides 
parents opportunities for district wide networking. 

The school will partner with ASPIRA in joint decision making to ensure that the parents are welcomed and celebrated on 
a monthly basis. The school will implement a monthly “Chat and Chews with the Principal” outlining the direction the 
school is going in, and addressing any concerns of the parents.

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
Welcome signs and directions have been placed on main floor to direct parents to the Parent Welcome Center. School 
Safety personnel have been trained and inculcated in our parent engagement practices and are briefed daily, on all of 
our family and parent events and activities as to better direct visiting BAMM parents upon entering the school, to the 
Parent Welcome center. Upon arrival at the BAMM Parent Welcome Center either a member of the Parent Association, 
the Parent Coordinator and or lead CBO staff can assist visiting parents with their queries or concerns. ·  

If a member of the PA or the Parent Coordinator are with another parent or unavailable, the School Safety Staff will 
contact a someone from the School Support Team to come main entrance greet and escort the parent(s) to the student 
support center to render assistance. Interpretation services will be made available for all parents during the facilitation 
of parent workshops, conferences and meetings. 

Families will be encouraged to explore the school building and classrooms, and partake in a gallery walk to view scholar 
work products. The school will maintain its open door policy wherein parents are always welcome to meet with 
administration, schedule appointments to see staff, and work with the parent coordinator to address concerns and 
celebrate scholar learning. With the assistance of ASPIRA, the school will create a comprehensive and thoughtful 
calendar of Parent workshops offerings and other parent and community engagement offerings. 

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
 
The school will partner with ASPIRA in joint decision making to ensure that the parents are welcomed and celebrated on 
a monthly basis. The school will implement a monthly “Chat and Chews with the Principal” outlining the direction the 
school is going in, and addressing any concerns of the parents. We also will provide an opportunity for BAMM parents 
to take on leadership roles in the decision making process through their involvement in the PA and SLT structures. 

 

 
 

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
Workshops and hands-on demonstrations will be offered to families that outline the expectations of the common core, 
the school’s shift to a humanities-based lens, inquiry work, and the expanded learning time initiative. There will also be 
literature and website information (including DOE) provided so that families can do further research on their own.  

In addition we will be engaging our parents through school wide engagement events including but not limited to: 

1.  Family Night Curriculum Night– (September 2018)  
2.  Monthly Parent “Chat and Chews” with the Principal – Where Parents can enjoy an audience with the principal

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
In alignment with our school's instructional focus "engage every student, across grades 6-8, with a sequence of 
theme-based, interdisciplinary units of study across all core content areas", ELT was created to offer student choice as 
well as academic support in alignment with our Renewal Benchmarks. The Bronx Academy of Multi-Media not only 
moving to embed the use of technology/social media/media arts within the school day, but also reinforcing this 
within our extended learning time. For example, we are offering our student this year Coding/Robotics, Maker, Digital 
Photography, Graphic Arts, as well as accelerated Math enrichment, Math AIS, Homework Help, ENL enrichment, 
Rocking the Boat, Dance, Hollistic Physical Ed./Yoga, Flag Football, Theatre and Elevate NY/Student Empowerment. 
Students were given the opportunity to sign up for the extended learning time class that interested them as well as 
being assigned an AIS class on a rotating basis. ELT is a collaboration between the school, the lead CBO (ASPIRA) and 
our Beacon Program (Graham Wyndam).  

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type 

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?

How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make 
learning relevant and engaging?   
How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day? 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as 

to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of 
graduation. 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
281 

 

 

 

          

 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and 

language mandates are met during ELT? 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the 

supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to 

school faculty and community partner staff? 

  What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners? 
  How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement? 
  How will effective outreach be conducted to families? 
  How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage 

participation? 

The school and ASPIRA will use multiple data sources to identify student interest, strengths, and needs in order to 
prioritize and schedule a range of activities. Interest surveys will be offered quarterly to keep a pulse on student 
interests. The Bronx Academy of Multi-Media not only moving to embed the use of technology/social media/media 
arts within the school day, but also reinforcing this within our extended learning time. For example, we are offering 
our student this year Coding/Robotics, Maker, Digital Photography, Graphic Arts, as well as accelerated Math 
enrichment, Math AIS, Homework Help, ENL enrichment, Rocking the Boat, Dance, Hollistic Physical Ed./Yoga, Flag 
Football, Theatre and Elevate NY which is a student empowerment program, focusing on the social emotional well 
being of our students. Students were given the opportunity to sign up for the extended learning time class that 
interested them as well as being assigned an AIS class on a rotating basis. All academic ELT offerings are provided by a 
licensed NYC pedagogue. ELT is a collaboration between the school, the lead CBO (ASPIRA) and our Beacon Program 
(Graham Wyndam). Students with disabilities as well as our ENL population will attend a rotating ELT schedule, which 
provides either academic enrichment or language support through a licensed DOE pedagogue. Dream Yard (a 
program provider contracted through ASPIRA) provides professional development for the licensed teachers that 
collaborate with their teaching artists which includes theatre, maker, digital photography and poetry. Teachers and 
teaching artists meet once a week to plan instruction collaboratively. All ELT classes are led by licensed pedagogues 
except the programs led by our Beacon provider such as Rocking the Boat, Coding, Dance and Bookmaking. Parents 
will kept informed through workshops, newsletters and PA meetings. ELT is part of the school day program and is 
scheduled in STARS. Parents are informed via report cards and progress reports on how their child is performing 
within their ELT class. All students participate in ELT as it is part of the school day.

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal 
program. 
1. 

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together 
with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead 
implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

1.  Community School Director has been hired and is working closely with Principal to ensure all goals are aligned 

with the school’s mission. 

2.  Extended Learning Time will be scheduled into the student's calendar. We will alternate the push in services 
so the 2.students of each grade can participate in all ELT offerings through the course of the school year. This 
School year we will be exploring ways to strengthen mental health support services in the school. We will be 
working with power tools to develop an advisory program for students. This program is designed to empower 
scholar activists. We will also work to strengthen our partnership with ASTOR and offer more informational 
workshops for families. This will be coupled with ASPIRA hiring a mental health coordinator whose primary 
task will be to identify the needs of the students and families, and identify ways to meet them. We are 
scheduled to bring in ESL and GED classes for the school community. We are also seeking to build 
relationships with local organizations to provide more to our school community such as The Point, YMCA, 
Hunts Point Alliance and SOBRO. 

3.  We will be looking for creating a robust family engagement strategy that this year is parent-driven. I seek to 

shift ownership of the family engagement to the parents. Step one will be to utilize our current parent leaders 
to reach out and contact every parent and see what they will like to see from workshops and ways to be more 
engaged at the school. In collaboration with the school, we will find ways to engage parents and raise 
participation along with fostering stronger and more positive relationships with the school.  

Our goal is to diminish the historical negative perception the community may have of the school.

1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 
1.  ASPIRA is the lead CBO supporting the school in coordinating ELT activities via subcontractors. ASTOR will be 

providing mental health supports in collaboration with ASPIRA’s MHC. Graham-Windham provides after-
school enrichment offerings to middle school students in the community. 

2.  Our Community School Team will consist of CSD, MHC, Community Coordinator, Parent Coordinator, PTA 

President, & representation from school administration. Our meetings will focus on key community school 
events, attendance strategies, and key stakeholder partnerships that need to take place. 

3.  We will use the date sorter during our weekly attendance meetings to review and look for patterns related to 

chronically absent students, and we will assign targeted interventions to each student, and assign Success 
Mentors/use advisory time to check-in with chronically absent students. 

 

 
Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
We are working in collaboration with school day to ensure we are all on the same page in regards to Community 
School programming. All adjustments are made in accordance with school administration. Additional funding in the 
community school budget will be required to allow for greater enrichment of the instructional curriculum and ELT.

Step One – Tier I “Universal 
Screening” 

All students at the beginning of the 
year are placed in assigned classes. 
This is based on age, promotion 
grade level, transfer-in grade, 
parental decision and/or 
involvement, and I.E.P. and any 
mandated programs already in 
place. Once classes have started, 
the classroom teachers and all out 
of classroom/service provider staff 
who come in contact with students, 
start a 6 – 10 week observation and 
assessment period to evaluate the 
current educational 
setting/program. The following 
measures are used for initial 
assessment: 

  Teacher’s College flexible 

is referred to the 
CST (Child Study 
Team) for 
possible Tier II 
applications. 

 

 

 

 

groupings 
Formal Data (NY State 
testing scores –ELA,

Spanish LAB, and item 
analysis documentation) 

Informal Data -classwork, 
homework, behavior and 
social interactions, 
conversations, parent 
meetings, input from 
service providers, 
comparing incoming scores 
to observable work, use of 
the American Reading 
Company’s Reading 
Program and assessment 
protocols in 
theirIRLA(English) 
andENIL(Spanish).

 

 

After the initial observation 
period where various 
methodologies and 
practices were tried, and no 
change or gains have been 
observed, the student is 
referred to theCST(Child 
Study Team) for possible 
Tier II applications. 

 

Step Two – Tier II “ Small 
group Target Teaching” 

Groups of 8 to 10 students 
are created who 
demonstrate a similar 
challenge point/deficit in a 
specific content area or a 
social/behavioral need. 
Specific teachers/specialists 
are assigned to work with a 
group based on scheduling. 
A 6 – 10 week observation 
and assessment period to 
evaluate the improvement, 
no movement, or regression 
of the students in the target 
group. At the end of this 
period, theCSTmeets to 
evaluate the data 
presented. If no movement 
is seen, another 6- 10 weeks 
of contact can be assigned 
for those students who 
need it. If improvement is 
evident in some students, 
they may be dismissed from 
the small group targeted 
instruction grouping of Tier 
II. Tier II instruction must be 
given in a different setting 
from the regular classroom 
environment. It can be 
administered at a separate 
table/area in the back of the 
classroom by the classroom 
teacher as a separate and 
additional instruction time. 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

It can also be administered 
in a separate location by a 
specialist or by the 
classroom teacher as 
additional instruction time. 
The parent/guardian is kept 
abreast of the status and 
progress of their child at 
regular intervals. The 
following services are 
offered: 

  ENL/ESL 
  AISfor E.L.A.and MATH 
  AISin Spanish for MATH 
 
  At risk small group 

SETSSfor all content areas 

Counseling 
 

 

 

 

Step Three – Tier III 
“Intensive ONE on ONE 
targeted teaching.” 

At this level the student has 
demonstrated minimal and 
struggling ability to progress 
in the focus subject area of 
challenge after multiple 
reapplications and various 
strategies at the Tier II level. 

The student is placed with a 
specialist in a ONE to ONE 
(sometime although rarely 
TWO to ONE) situation. 
Instruction must be given in 
a different setting from the 
regular classroom 
environment. It can be 
administered at a separate 
table/area in the back of the 
classroom by the classroom 
teacher as a separate and 
additional instruction time. 
It can also be administered 
in a separate location by a 
specialist or by the

classroom teacher as 
additional instruction time. 
Intensive care is given to 
the individual student to 
help them show progress 
and understanding in the 
target/subject area. A 6 – 
10 week observation and 
assessment period to 
evaluate the improvement, 
no movement, or regression 
of the student is set. At the 
end of this period, an 
addition 6 – 10 weeks of 
instruction at the Tier III 
level can be conducted. 
After the agreed to number 
of reapplication sessions 
has been completed, 
theCSTmeets to evaluate 
the data presented. If no 
movement is seen at the 
Tier III level, the next step is 
to advise the parent and 
forward with an Official 
Evaluation for the possibility 
of a special education 
program and the 
incorporation of an 
Individual Education Plan 
(I.E.P.). The parent/guardian 
is called in for an in person 
meeting and all findings and 
possible next steps are 
discussed together.

In the event that we have to replace a staff member, we take the following steps: 

● Current staff member recommendations 

● The Principal’s Secretary works closely with the network Human Resources point person to ensure that anyone who 
is not deemed highly qualified submits all required documentation and meets assessment deadlines. 

● Mentors are assigned to support first year teachers in curriculum development, classroom management and 
professional enhancement.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The school developed a Measurement of Student Learning Committee prior to the summer session. The committee’s 
directive is making decisions about assessments and growth measurements that will be instituted throughout the 
coming year. The committee performs the research and analyzes the best fit for our students and the effective use of 
available human/systems resources. The final recommendations are reviewed by the teaching staff to obtain 
consensus and awareness. In addition an internal scoring committee was developed to perform all rubric based 
assessments and systematize the flow of item analysis data into various systems. The information gathered from the 
various assessments are consolidated in the school data repository.  

The Staff Development Committee analyzed data from multiple sources to identify needs, and collaborated to plan 
professional learning support for our staff in support of those identified needs to improve instruction for all students. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
296 

 

 

 

          

 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 08X424 The Hunts Point School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

BAMM! will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
299 

 

 

 

          

 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”

Begin description here:            
Part B 
 
Rationale: Our Title III Direct Instruction Program will consist of two elements. The first will be 
three Saturday ELL trips during the school year. These three trips will be for new arrival ELLs to 
learn English by doing, seeing, and connecting real life experiences to curriculum.  The second 
will be an after school program two days a week for new admit/new arrival ELLs to improve 
their English usage in all four modalities using written texts, as well as technology. Based on the 
NYSITEL results, our new arrival ELLs are entering with very low literacy skills in English. We 
also feel that the 360 mandated ENL minutes of instruction per week isn’t fully meeting their 
needs. Also our 8th grade ELLs showed no growth on the Science Baseline MOSL to the End of 
year MOSL. Therefore, a focus on science will be integrated into the program. 
 
Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served: ELLs in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade who are 
new admits as well as continuing ELLs up to two years in the system. NYSESLAT/NYSITEL 
levels to be considered will be ENTERING, EMERGING and TRANSITIONING. In the event 
any long term ELLS show a desire and motivation to participate, they will be considered for 
inclusion based on space limitations and availability. We expect 20 students to participate in the 
after school program, and  25 to 45 students to participate in the Saturday trips. The groups will 
mixed levels. There will be ONE teacher in the after-school classroom facilitating the mixed 
groupings. The number of teachers accompanying the Saturday trips will vary depending on the 
number of students that receive parental permission to attend. The current ratio is 1:10 so we 
could have from 1 to 5 teachers attending. The attending teachers will all have ESL or B.E. 
licenses.  
 
Schedule and duration: The three Saturdays will be spaced throughout the school year. The trips 
will run from 10:00am till 2:00pm. The trips will consist of approximately 25-45 students with 
accompanying teachers based on the mandated ratio of 1:10. Accompanying teachers will be 
ESL and/or B.E. certified. If more accompanying teachers are needed, funding will come from 
alternative sources and not this grant. The first trip will be scheduled for October/November. 
This will be at the NY Botanical Gardens. The topic area is Earth Science. Student will have to 
collect data to describe two of their favorite flowers or plants seen. I.E. – note taking, 
sketching/rendering, taking pictures, etc. The will have to find out the origin of their choice 
flower and plant as well. Upon return to school, they will have to present their data in a manner 
differentiated to their level. (a project board, a graphic organizer, a written report). Students in 
the after-school program will have time during the two after-school sessions to work on the final 
product. ELLs not in the after-school program can complete the final project on their own time. 
The second trip will be scheduled for January/February. This one will be to the Rose 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
306 

 

 

 

          

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Planetarium. The topic area is Space Science. Students will be collecting data  to support the 
statement “I would like to be an astronaut” or “I would not like to be an astronaut.”  They must 
collect supporting evidence to back up their choice.  Again using note-taking, 
sketching/rendering, taking pictures, etc. They will also attend the winter Sky Show in the 
planetarium auditorium. Upon return they will have to present their findings in written form 
based on their differentiated linguistic ability. The post trip production finalization will be the 
same as the first trip. 
The third trip will be scheduled for May or June after testing. This one will be to the 911 
Memorial Park and to go to the top of the Observatory. The focus will be Social Studies: history 
& geography. 
Students will see the footprint of the original World Trade Center towers and see the fountains. 
They will see the names of those who died and be able to attach a location to something they 
have just heard about. They will then go to the top of the Observatory. Each student will have a 
map of the City of New York. They will have to locate things on the map that they see from the 
observatory windows and write down the names of the missing objects. They will also see and 
hear a brief multi-sensory production produced by the Observatory. Upon return they will have 
to write a review of this trip. By the end of the year they should all be able to produce a two or 
more paragraph written piece. The post trip production finalization will be the same as the past 
two trips. 
 
Due to the regulations on student teacher ratio on trips, for 45 students we will need to have 5 
teacher chaperons. Each teacher will be paid for 6hours of Per Diem. All entrance fees, and 
transportation for the students and teachers will also be paid for. Teachers acting as chaperons 
who are not entitled to Title III funds, will be covered by other school funds. Student attendance 
upon entering the after school sessions and on all trips, will be taken at arrival to the classroom 
or to school prior to departing for the trip. Attendance will be kept in a TItle III Supp Grant Data 
Binder. Parents will be notified about the trip and asked for permission in English and their 
Home Language as her the HLIS surveys. Our parents speak Spanish and French and we have in-
house translators available. For Arabic we will use the Translation and Interpretation Unit 
services.   
 
The after school program will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays for 60mins after the school 
day ends based on scheduling for September 2016. These after school sessions will run from 
notification of grant approval till the end of the school year: June 2017. If funding from the grant 
is depleted, additional/special renewal school funding can be used for per-session. Currently the 
scheduled time is proposed to be 3:45pm till 4:45pm. During these sessions students will be able 
to use ENL software like www.educationcity.com, and www.rosettastone.com  or other 
programs to improve their English skills.  These software programs are independent work 
programs, and students can continue their work at home in the evenings and on weekends. They 
also produce reports on student progress. In addition, students will engage in English vocabulary 
building activities I.E. – sentence building blocks, flash cards, and reading NEWSFORYOU - an 
ESL weekly news periodical. Students will also be able to do content area homework and 
received assistance by the ENL certified teacher in the room. The two afternoons will be taught 
alternatively by the two ENL certified teachers on staff. Students attending the ENL after-school 
will sign in when they arrive and sign out when they leave. A maximum of 20 students will be 
able to participate on either day due to space and staffing restrictions. Groupings will be mixed 
levels based on 2016 NYSESLAT level or the NYSITEL. The content they are working on, and 
the number of students actually attending each session will vary. Our goal is to hold 40 sessions 
by the end of the school year that will end in June 2017.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Language of Instruction: The language of instruction will be in English. However, based on the 
fact that the majority of our ELL population speaks Spanish and French, we will use these home 
languages to assist the instruction when the students' frustration level hinders student progress. 
Our ENL Coordinator functions in both Spanish and French, and we have support staff on hand 
to also assist in both languages.     
 
Types of certified teachers: Currently M.S. 424 has two certified ENL Teachers and two 
Bilingual Education certified teachers on staff. We do not expect any staffing changes for 
September 2016. In addition to these four educators, we will use the Bilingual Guidance 
counselor for support services as needed as no additional cost to Title III funds.  
If additional support staff is needed, funding will come from alternative sources. 
 
Types of Materials:  a) annual license for Educationcity.com software b) 15 individual licenses 
for Rosettastone.com software c) Achieve3000.com software – no expense to the Title III grant 
d) subscription for NEWSFORYOU weekly printed periodical. E) internet access to google.com 
using ipads and laptops in the ENL lab – no expense to the Title III grant F) trip log books  G) 
colored pencils and sketch pads H) cameras – no expense to the Title III grant I) smartboard 
technology installed in the ENL Lab – no expense to the Title III grant

Part C – Professional Development 
 
Rationale: Effective September 2016 every teacher will have to have 100 hours of PD within a 
five year period. The NYC DOE requires 15% of such Professional Development to be related to 
ENL/ELL instruction for general education teachers. In addition, 50% of all Professional 
Development must be in ENL/ELL for ENL/Bilingual Ed.  certified teachers. 33% of our student 
population at M.S. 424 identify as ELLs. Professional development is built into the weekly 
schedule for all teachers with one day of 65 minutes - Monday, and one day of 40 mins. (7th 
period selection once a week). To assist teachers develop their pedagogy for ELLs, finding links 
in the CCLS and ELL lesson planning, and finding ways to differentiate lesson plans to provide 
multiple entries for ELLs, the title III Supp funds will enable us to bring in sub-contractors to 
facilitate professional development. Also we will be able to send teachers to the Annual UFT 
Middle School Conference in NYC which offers ENL/ESL specific workshops. In addition, in 
house professional development will be offered by the ENL Coordinator on various ENL 
strategies to increase understanding in the ENL classroom, at no additional cost to the grant. 
Topics will include but not limited to: Differentiation of lesson plans for ELLs, and Scaffolding 
reading & writing texts for ELLs, All training scheduled will be facilitated in conjunction and

Part C: Professional Development  
coordination with the school PLC. The ENL Coordinator will participate with the PLC at no cost 
to the Title III grant. Specific dates  and topics of the trainings will be advised upon confirmation 
by the PLC. Each session will be a one time learning experience.   
 
The subcontracts to be used are (but not limited to): 
American Reading Company -100 Book Challenge: 
MS 424 has already purchased the 100 Book Challenge reading program. One of the pre-reading 
components consists of site-words, phonemic awareness, and high frequency word charts. Also 
sound/symbol correspondence visual clue cards. This component can be implemented into the 
ELL ENTERING and EMERGING level students’ lesson planning. To properly use this facet of 
the 100 Book Challenge, ELA and ENL teachers working with ELLs need to be trained on how 
it works.      Two 1 hour sessions will be scheduled on a Monday or Tuesday. 
 
Educationcity.com software usage Training: 
This software will be purchased to be used during after-school, weekends, and at home by 
students. 
This software is an independent work program that increases English vocabulary and 
understanding of content area work in English, Math in Spanish, and a separate “Learn English” 
for new arrival ELLs. To properly use this software I.E. – understand the structure, how to 
manipulate the modules, how to track progress and run reports, etc, ELA, MATH and ENL 
teachers working with ELLs need to be trained on how it works. One 1 hour session will be 
scheduled on a Monday or Tuesday. 
 
Rosettastone.com software usage Training: 
M.S. 424 will be purchasing approximately 15 licenses for new arrivals to learn English with this 
software. This software is internationally acclaimed to teach a new language. It is an independent 
program that tracks and increases the rigor level of the modules as students’ levels increase. The 
software allows teachers to track progress and offer additional support in trouble spots. ENL 
teachers overseeing the usage of this program need to be trained on how it works. One  1 hour 
session will be scheduled on a Monday or Tuesday. 
 
Achieve3000.com software usage Training: 
M.S. 424 will be purchasing a school license to use the Achieve3000.com software. The software 
automatically places students at their entry level “lexial reading level” and automatically 
increases the rigor level as they complete reading tasks. This software has an English component, 
a Spanish component and a blending of both languages component. It is an excellent tool to 
increase reading levels of ELLs in ENL and Dual Language programs. Due to the fact MS 424 
has applied for a Dual Language program for September 2016, this software will be integral. 
ELA and ENL Teachers need to be trained on how it works. Two 1 hour sessions will be 
scheduled on a Monday or a Tuesday. 
 
TEQsmart “smartboard” software and equipment Training: 
Each classroom at M.S. 424 is equipped with smartboard technology. The software that comes 
with this equipment is multi-faceted with activities to increase English language competency. 
There are also ENL specific manipulatives included. Both of these components can be integrated 
into a blended learning classroom environment. TEQsmart offers at school location training by 
their support staff on how to manipulate the software and use the actual equipment. Teachers 
need to be trained on how to use this software fully and to use the equipment better as well. Two 
1 hour sessions will be scheduled on a Monday or Tuesday (or scheduling will be based on the 
contract provisions offered by TEQsmart).

Part C: Professional Development  
 
UFT Middle School Conference – registering for ENL workshop track 
For the past three years, in collaboration with the NYC DOE, the UFT has organized a city wide 
Middle School Conference. Each year M.S. 424 has sent teachers who work with our ELL 
population to the conference to attend the ENL track workshops. This conference was approved 
as professional development under the Title III in past years. Our teachers have returned and 
turn-keyed the information on a few occasions. The actual course work has been incorporated 
into the attending teachers’ lesson planning as well. It has been a beneficial experience and one 
that should be continued. The registration is $30.00 per teacher and the Per Diem (per UFT 
contract pay schedule) for the day is 6 hours per teacher in attendance. The 2017 conference is 
tentatively scheduled to take place on Saturday March 4th from 9:00am till 3:00pm.  
 
In-house ENL Training Sessions 
The ENL Coordinator on staff will conduct a minimum of three professional development 
sessions each lasting approximately 60 minutes on best practices in a classroom that has multi-
level ELLs. 
Topics for instruction will consist of, but not limited to: a) differentiating using of anchor texts in 
the ELA content area b) pre-loading key vocabulary in all content area classrooms c) process 
charts made of visual clues d) labeling classroom equipment e) using graphic organizers for pre-
reading and pre-writing f) the structure and implementation of CR-154 and how it effects all 
teachers. This training will be at no additional cost to the Title III grant, and will take place on 
Mondays from 2:45 till 3:40pm.  
 
Attendance for specific ESL P.D.s will be taken at the start of the session. Agendas will be 
distributed to all participants as well. These attendance sheets and agendas will be kept in the 
Title III ENL Supp Grant Data Binder. 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Rationale: The Title III grant would minimally be used to implement Parent Engagement due to 
the fact that M.S. 424 is a Community school and has designated ASPIRA our Renewal School 
CBO to facilitate and finance many of these programs. Programs related or not related to the 
Title III grant, will be notated accordingly. All Parent Engagement is scheduled and coordinated 
in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator and the ASPIRA/CBO programmer. Due to the fact 
that 33% of our students are ELLs and approximately 50% of our Parents speak another 
language at home rather than English, ASPIRA/CBO does a great deal of ELL Parent education 
and assistance. Many of the programs and events are covered by ASPIRA/CBO and general 
Renewal School funding, and not by Title III ENL Supp Grant funding. The rationale for the 
mandated engagement activities is self-evident. For the two Title III ENL Supp Grant activities, 
we found that taking our parents out of Hunts Point, increases participation and involvement. 
The two conferences being sited, I.E. DOE Parent Conference, and the UFT Parent Conference, 
will give parents a chance to network with other parents out of Hunts Point. In addition, based on 
parents verbally surveyed at Parents' Association meetings, they enjoy and prefer to take "small 
trips" more than in house learning opportunities.  
 
Schedule, Duration, Topics, Provider, Notification: 
All correspondence (invitations, notices, advisement, sign-in sheets, agendas) with parents: in 
writing and verbally, is done in English and the Home language of choice by the Parent. We 
have in-house Spanish and French speakers who assist with this. For Arabic, we use the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit services. The Parent Coordinator also works closely with the 
ENL Coordinator in regard to parents of ELLs. A monthly calendar is distributed to parents 
showing all activities planed. In addition, we sent letters home as well use "ROBO-Call" to 
remind parents by leaving automatic messages on their phones. ASPIRA/CBO and the Parent 
Coordinator maintain sign in sheets and distribute agendas where applicable.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses the following assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs: NYSITEL results, Spanish LAB 
results when applicable, American Reading Company's IRLA in English and ENIL in Spanish, Teacher's College Running 
Records, and the LENS to evaluate if a student is a SIFE when applicable. Informally we use  oral interviews, content/classroom 
teacher observations/collected date , first making period results (first 6 weeks), outcome of classroom and homework 
assignments, and service provider input where applicable. By using the data, in conjunction with data from other assessments 
such as the state ELA, math and science exams, MOSL exams and class grades, teachers can create an appropriate 
individualized action plan for future instruction of the student 
The insights from the data these tools provide help to group by language level for scheduling.  Also it provides data to know 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
314 

 

 

 

          

 

 

how many new incoming students might be SIFE as well as which students may have literacy in another language other than 
English. The Spanish LAB assesses the level of Spanish proficiency at entry as well.  We utilize these results to plan our 
AIS/Small group, general ed. and enrichment programming of our ELL population.   Data from our beginning/mid and end of 
year periodic assessment is also utilized to inform instruction and movement. 
Former ENL students will also continue to receive support from the ESL teacher. The individual needs of former ENL students 
will be assessed through cluster meetings involving the core content teachers and the ENL provider.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL coordinator meets with each incoming student and family to begin to assess the language needs of the student. 
Classroom teachers are trained in how to administer assessments. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Teachers College on demand writing tasks will be used for baseline and endline assessments, as well as the ELL Periodic 
Assessment, iReady diagnostic assessments, and teacher created unit baselines and endlines. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data is gathered, the ENL teachers and Peer Collaborative Teachers will analyze the data to determine what 
interventions need to take place. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Historically, the data shows that the majority of our newly arrived students are pre-literate and/or SIFE in their first language, 
based on the NYSITELL. The NYC ELL Periodic Assessment is also a tool to show trends, as well as the NYSELAT. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Structures in place include shared common planning periods, weekly extended cabinet meetings, and the placement of the 
data on a central file in google drive. This allows for teachers to analyze data and plan/make adjustments to curricula and 
programs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ENTERING and EMERGING level ELLs will receive their ENL stand-alone instruction in the ENL Language Lab. in a mixed 
proficiency level setting. It will be a homogeneous grouping of these two levels that will be ungraded and solely based 
on language level. The pull-out schedule will not take place during ELA or MATH time.  They will receive their ENL 
integrated instruction by one of the two ENL certified teachers pushing-in during content area teaching. The ELLs will 
be grouped together in the general education setting  and receive direct assistance to  in the Gen. Ed environment 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
315 

 

 

 

          

 

 

(360 minutes per week). The push-in structure will be homogeneous by grade and levels will be mixed. 
TRANSITIONING and EXPANDING level ELLs will receive their ENL integrated instruction in a push-in setting during 
content area teaching. ELLs at these two levels depending on individual motivation and ability,  may or may not be 
grouped together in the Gen. Ed. content area environment. The push-in structure will be by grade and the levels will 
be mixed (180 minutes per week). 
COMMANDING level ELLs will receive their ENL integrated instruction in ENL in a push-in setting in one of their 
content area classes: preference being E.L.A. At the COMMANDING level ELLs are highly functional in the Gen. Ed. 
environment and only need reassurance and occasional clarification with class work.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

The Transitional Bilingual Program at The Hunts Point Middle School will be pending enrollment numbers in grade 6. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All push-in and pull-out services are administered by the two ENL teachers.  The ENL teachers are also responsible for 
scheduling ESL classes so that all ELL students receive the mandated instructional minutes. The students are pulled out during 
their non-core periods so that ESL does not encroach on the core content areas. The ENL teacher works very closely with the 
ELA teacher so that instruction parallels the ELA curriculum.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content area instruction is delivered in English by general education staff in forty-five minute periods (90 minutes for Literacy 
and Math), with support from the ENL teachers.  Additionally, the ENL teachers instruct students using lower-level text on 
content area subjects as a means of  support.  During pull-out sessions, the ENL teacher teaches a "bootcamp" for language 
acquisition. Other supports provided are the use of English and Native Language dictionaries and books, audio books, and 
Native Language speakers for instruction. All materials used in core content classes will be translated into the student's home 
language. All texts used in the student's native language will be in alignment with the CCLS. All ELL's have access to iPads or 
laptops and regularly use educational programs and translation apps. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The ELL teacher makes sure that each core content teacher is equipped with the necessary assessments in every ELL’s native 
language. These assessments are a combination of teacher made tests and past state exams. This allows those students who 
intend to take their state assessment in their native language to have the opportunity to practice dealing with both the format 
and content of the test.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) SIFE students are evaluated in their native language to assess deficiencies in reading, writing, listening and speaking to 
better determine areas in need of greater support. Once the ENL teachers have assessed areas of weakness they will then 
work closely with the student's content teachers to create strategies that specifically address help the student in the identified 
areas. Once an action plan has been created it will be implemented by the student's cluster teachers as well as the ENL teacher 
with regular reviewing occurring during ongoing enquiry meetings. 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
316 

 

 

 

          

 

 
b) Newcomers are provided with a risk free, welcoming environment to meet their transitional needs. These students are 
encouraged to become involved in learning their new language through role plays, simulations, projects, field trips and 
scaffolded lessons in the "bootcamp". It is important to provide informal assessments in order to know students' prior 
knowledge and build on the skills they already have in order for them to acquire new skills. Native language support may be 
provided, through home language print, technologies, translations in the native language and encouraging "buddy systems" of 
students who speak a same home language. When a new student is registered in our school, it is crucial to find out if they are 
literate in their native language in order to provide materials that will support them academically (i.e., books, glossaries, 
dictionaries).  Students and teachers work together improving listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.  Focus is given to 
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, decoding, encoding, as well as reading comprehension. Students who have 
to take state exams (i.e., ELA, Math, etc.) are taught explicit test taking skills and are encouraged to enroll in the school’s After 
School Program for further support. In order to provide ELLs native language support, state exams maybe administered in the 
student’s native language or when unavailable, translators are hired to support students. Newcomers receive explicit 
instruction that addresses their transitional needs and academic needs, as well as language development strategies.  Listening 
comprehension is mainly targeted with newcomers, through the use of software and web based programs.  Teachers work 
with newcomers in a rigorous language development program in order to prepare them to take the required ELA test after one 
year. 
 
c) & d)  For ELLs receiving services 4 - 6 years and for long-term ELLs, assessment data is carefully analyzed to determine areas 
ofweakness and instruction is planned to address those weaknesses within the classroom. Teachers regularly read assessment 
data to monitor the student’s progress in all content areas and better differentiate instruction for specific academic 
needs.  The skills that prove to be more difficult are targeted in small group settings.  
 
e)   Former ELLs will be given assistance on an individualized basis. The ENL teachers will work closely with the content 
teachers to create an action plan that will help address any areas where the former ELL might still need assistance. Also all 
teachers are to be made aware of the testing accommodations to which former ELLs are still entitled. Former ELLs will also be 
encouraged to sign up for all extracurricular programs open to ELLs..  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs must have equal access to high-quality instruction designed to help them meet high expectations as well as follow 
all modifications of their I.E.P.s. Teachers should employ strategies known to be effective with ELLs, such as drawing on their 
prior knowledge; providing opportunities to review previously learned concepts and teaching them to employ those concepts; 
organizing themes or strands that connect the curriculum across subject areas; and providing individual guidance, assistance, 
and support to fill gaps in background knowledge. Early intervention strategies must be implemented as soon as learning 
problems/delays are observed. Examples of early intervention include clinical teaching, peer and expert consultation, teacher 
assistance teams, and alternative programs such as those that offer tutorial or remedial instruction in the context of general 
education. Teachers conduct curriculum-based assessment to monitor student progress and use the data from these 
assessments to plan and modify instruction in Clinical teaching. Peers or experts work collaboratively with Gen. Ed. teachers to 
address students' learning problems/delays and to implement recommendations for interventions. Teachers can share 
instructional resources, observe each other's classrooms, and offer suggestions for improving instruction or managing 
behavior. ENL teachers can help general education teachers by demonstrating strategies to integrate ELLs into the mainstream 
classrooms.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ELL-SWDs receive their ENL instruction either as push-in or pull-out. We strive to maintain the least disruptive 
environment for our ELL-SWDs to learn in. The least amount of pull-out is the optimum situation wherever possible.  The I.E.P.s 
of each ELL is reviewed and the stipulations, and  modifications are taken into consideration at all times.

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Counseling is offered in English and in Spanish. AIS Math is also provided in Spanish as well. The "bootcamp" program is also an 
intervention implemented for content area classes and acclimation to English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the coming school year, we intend to make the following improvements to our programming: 
1-  Hiring of a dual license teacher Special Education/Bilingual Education  
2- More Professional Development with a focus of ENL strategies for staff will be scheduled. 
3- Parent ENL classes will be scheduled for two afternoons weekly. 
4- Our T.B.E. Bridge class will be receiving Technology classes in English. 
5- Our T.B.E. Bridge class will be traveling to other classrooms to receive content area instruction in English with push-in ENL 
assistance. 
6- The DOE Translation and Interpretation unit will be utilized more to reach more parents in their HL.

your building. 
Our ELL population is included in all school programs including after school and supplemental services. When notices are 
posted or distributed for students to select what they would like to participate in, the notices are in English and Spanish. For 
students whose HL is French we have three French staff members who can translate it for them. For students whose HL is 
Arabic or Fulani, we have been able to have other students translate and utilize the NYC DOE translation department. We also 
offer a Saturday Academy for all of our students where a self-contained ENL class/group is held.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The following instructional materials are used but are not limited to, to support the ELLs in our school. 
1- ipad translation apps 
2- Entering Level ELLs = starfall.com and educationcity.com software. 
3- Emerging and up ELL levels = educationcity.com and achieve3000.com software 
4- ATTANASIO & ATTANASIO testing expertise materials (all levels) 
5-  NEWSFORYOU ESL weekly newspaper reader (Emerging level and up) 
6- American Reading Company's IRLA independent reading program (all levels)

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is offered through the provision of bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, translation technology (IPads and 
laptops),, teacher support and authentic materials in the home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Before the start of the school year the administration sits down and ensures that all services and resources and services 
correspond to the ELL population's ages and grade levels. These meetings occur frequently throughout the year. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We have shared space; we share the library.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
There is a 6  th   grade orientation prior to the start of the school year. Parents of ELLs, as well as ELLs, were welcomed and 
received a separate opportunity to hear about our ENL programs and ask questions. 
Throughout the school year as new arrivals and transfer-ins are enrolled, our ENL Coordinator and our Bilingual Social Worker 
have an open door policy to help students adjust as well as have a safe space to come to. The Parent Coordinator also 
conducts walk through's with new students when they enroll, so they are familiar with the school.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is offered as a language elective.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

n/a 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers at our school come in contact with ELLs. Therefore Professional Development for ELL personnel will include all 
staff. Our plan is to : 
1- ENL strategies to use in the classroom 
2- Fishbowl modeling of strategies/techniques and discussion afterwards 
3- Outside ENL facilitators 
4- ENL on line video instruction  
5- Best practice Co-teaching strategies 
6- Differentiating content area instruction for ELLs  
 
We also have outside providers come and deliver ELL PD's, such as District and Borough ELL representatives. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL teachers create and present workshops that keep the staff abreast of the latest ESL best practices. The times are 
calculated by the administrators in the building. Records of the workshops are kept in the PD binder in the main office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Every academic year the school organizes individual one on one meetings for the parents of ELLs. During these meetings the 
ENL teachers will discuss the details of the school's ENL program, the individual language progress of the ELL and the language 
development needs in the content areas. If the parents need an interpreter then one will be provided either through teachers 
in the building or through NYC DOE resources. 
We will continue to utilize the Parent Engagement time on Tuesday afternoons to schedule meetings and/or make phone calls 
to parents. We will continue to schedule meetings and/or phone calls during Professional Prep periods and after school, as 
well as evening hour phone calls home to parents who are unavailable due to work schedules during business hours. By the 
end of April all parents of ELLs will have had the opportunity for this one on one discussion. In addition, we will hold our 
Parents' of ELLs night within the first 6 weeks of school. At this gathering we re-show the mandated Parent Choice video (in the 
HL of the specific parent sub-grouping), we go over first observations and answer any questions the parent/guardian has. Due 
to the fact the majority of our Parents' HL is Spanish we use in-house staff for translation/interpretation. For the parents 
whose HL is French, we also have in-house staff for translation/interpretation. The parents who have Fulani as their HL, are 
usually fluent in French as well, and they bring other family members to assist in translation. Should we find ourselves with 
other language groups not covered in-house, we will fully utilize the DOE's T & I services department. All teachers use the 
existing procedure of maintain a log of meetings with parents in SKEDULA, as well as maintaining a parent sign in sheet for 
meetings. This sheet is created using EXCEL an shows 1- Parent name 2 - student name 3 - date seen  4 - topics discussed  5- 
signature.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

One of the specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs at our school is our after school adult ESL 
program.  We used part of our Title III Supp Grant money to hold classes for the Parents of ELLs to learn ENL. They not only 
learn ENL but they are exposed to different ways that they can interact with their children that promote learning. ASPIRA, our 
community partner, will also offer Adult ENL classes that will mirror our structure. We conduct monthly Parent Association 
meetings. These meetings are held in English and Spanish with all documents and discussions held in both languages. For 
parents whose HL is not English or Spanish, our goal is to use the DOE Translation and Interpretation unit's services as well as 
our in-house translators based on the based on the school staff language survey.     
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
In addition to the regular school day curriculum, our school offers many after school programs. Each of these program facilitators 
are aware of the high number of ELLs in our school. They take this into account and make sure that each student no matter what 
their language level, home language, or linguistic ability, have equal access.  
Saturday Academy - a class just for ELLs to improve their English skills in all content areas is held.  
Graham Wyndham Group - organizes an after school program and includes bilingual facilitators to make sure the ELL population 
can participate fully. In addition to the above, we offer the following enrichment opportunities. To participate in any of these listed, 
students must come to a full hour of tutoring before any enrichment program. This tutoring includes ENL. All ELLs are encouraged 
to participate in these activities to improve their interpersonal relationship skills as well as their ENL skills.  Also, due to the fact 
that our school is a Renewal/Community School, we have partnered with ASPIRA. We look forward to programming from ASPIRA 
that will offer assistance to lower level ELLs as well as enrichment to the higher level ELLs in our school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Steeve Traversiere, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

2018-2019 LANGUAGE TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETATION PLAN FOR PARENTS 

Requirement under Chancellor’s Regulations A663 for all schools 

 

DBN: 

08X424  
 

School 
Name: 

Hunts Point Middle School  
 

Superintendent: 

Dr. Karen Ames  
 

 
The principal has designated the following staff member as the primary Language Access Coordinator (LAC) in Galaxy. 
If there is more than one LAC, list all. 
 

First Name  

Last Name  

Title  

Has the LAC attended a 

2018-19 training 

The LAC was involved in 
the development of this 

conducted by the Field 

plan? Yes/No  

 

 

Language Access 

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At first meeting (walk-in) or upon registration, all parents are greeted in the main office by our bilingual staff. This 
is the first opportunity to assess the home language of the parent. The next steps are when the parent/guardian 
completes the HLIS and designates their language preference for all school communication, and when the 
parent/guardian completes the Student Emergency Blue Contact card and makes their designates there as well. 
This information populates the "RHLA" report in ATS. The RHLA report can be used to follow-up and and reinforce 
parent language choice throughout the year for new registrants' parents, as well as for returning students' 
parents. In addition, our Parent Coordinator maintains constant communication with our parents and ensures at 
monthly meetings, and via phone calls, that parent language preferences are maintained and upheld.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

Written Preferred  

Percent Written  

 

 

Oral Preferred  

Percent Oral  

 

 

Language  

The parent preferred 
languages for both written 
and oral communication at 
the Hunts Point Middle 
School are Arabic, English, 
French, Spanish, Fulani, 
Mandinkg, and Twi.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.  
 

Document Name  

Month/Frequency Distributed to 

How do you plan to translate? 

Subsequently 

Subsequently 

Our practice is to always produce all 
communication to parents I.E. - 
Calendars, Newsletters, meeting 
announcements, Program changes, etc. 
in both English and Spanish. For Arabic 
and French we either use Google 
Translate or send out the documents to 
the T & I Unit. However, many of our 
written correspondence is not 
produced with enough lead time to 
send to the T & I Unit. Subsequently 
items would come back "after the fact 
of importance." We strive to utilize the 
T & I Unit as much as we can. We find 
that involving family members or family

Families  

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents 

 

to parents.  

 

 

 

 

          

 
friends to help translate and interpret 
works best for our needs. Our parent 
population appears to be very satisfied 
with our line of communication to date.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to provide 

interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

It is difficult to predict most of the 
informal interactions with parents. 
However, for Parent-teacher 
conferences and meet the staff night, 
we have staff on hand who are 
bilingual in English, Spanish and 
French to assist. Our 4 Arabic 
speaking families come with language 
assistance, as well as the Fulani, 
Mandinga and Twi speakers. The 
Fulani, Mandinga, and Twi speaking 
families are also able to communicate 
in French: we have in house speakers 
of French as well.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
326 

 

 

 

          

 

 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

The T & I Unit welcome posters, Parents' Bill of Rights, and Parents Guide to Language Access are posted in the 
required places in our school. They are highly prominent and visable. The Language ID Guide and is posted at the 
Security Desk and in the Main Office as well. Our Parent Coordinator is aware of the T & I Unit and the protocols for 
Parent Language Choice and Access.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The Parent Coordinator and the Language Access Coordinator distribute a parent survey at the beginning of the 
school year and in January to ensure parents feel their home language request for oral and written communication is 
satisfactory. In addition, whenever a parent comes into the office or has a meeting they are asked if they understand 
English and/or if they need home language assistance at that time.
