Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Hillcrest is a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) school that proudly offers its students 
a world-class education with a dynamic faculty and challenging curriculum. Hillcrest's mission is to ensure that our 
students get the benefits and warmth of a small school setting with our eight Small Learning Communities all within a 
large comprehensive high school that offers Advanced Placement classes and one of the largest College Now 
programs in New York City. Every student enters one of our SLCs which is run by one teacher-leader, one school

counselor, and a dozen teachers who use rigorous instruction and data-tracking analysis to ensure credit 
accumulation and graduation success. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Hillcrest High School, a large comprehensive high school with over 3200 students and strong departmental content 
expertise faced a challenge: in 2005, only 55% of students earned a diploma in four years. How could Hillcrest not only 
maintain its strength, the rigorous content knowledge of the staff, but also create an environment that better 
positioned adults to meet the needs of all students, including 14% English Language Learners and 10% Students with 
Special Needs. Through a sweeping wall-to-wall reorganization that installed nine Small Learning Communities (SLCs) 
in just one year, Hillcrest turned its focus toward improving instruction for every student. 

The intended outcome of this transformation was to create a school where assistant principals continue to supervise 
and support content area expertise, while a cadre of trained teacher-directors leads SLCs in delivery of instruction and 
co-curricular support. Interdisciplinary teams of faculty and staff share students and space in common, make 
instructional decisions to meet the needs of their students, and accept accountability for student outcomes. The 
result: a more agile organization where student achievement, the heart of the Framework for Great Schools, drives 
teacher learning and collaboration.  

Today each SLC is recognized by its colors, by its space in the building, by its name on ID cards, by the outside 
partnerships it has developed, by its specific mission in educating its students, and, most significantly, by the 
community of teachers, guidance counselors, and learners at the heart of each SLC. Furthermore, building on 
Hillcrest's strengths, the nine SLCs offer a coherent approach to setting standards and creating goals. Assistant 
Principals are now Instructional Leaders, using departments to maintain content standards and expertise in every SLC, 
supporting teachers through the observation process, and focusing professional development on student needs. 

Everyone of Hillcrest’s students chooses to be part of one of our SLCs: Academy of Media Arts & Music, Pre-Med, 
Theatre, Teachers of Tomorrow, Public Service & Law, Business/ Technology (BIZ/Tek), Global Citizens, and Health 
Sciences and our iLearn Academy, which provides enhanced learning strategies for targeted students. Each SLC has 
about 450 students and has its own theme, course offerings, teachers and guidance counselors, creating a safe, 
nurturing and supportive environment that makes learning purposeful and enjoyable.  

As noted above, faculty and staff in each SLC know their students, a task made possible by working in a community of 
about 450 students. As a result, all adults in each SLC set high expectations for graduation and college and career 
readiness. The impact of this transformation is evident in our School Quality Guide, where we scored an 4.30 in the 
area of Rigorous Instruction and a 3.51 in Teacher Collaboration. In the areas of Family-Community Ties and Trust we 
scored a 3.23 and 3.63 respectively. In addition, we received a Proficient on the latest Quality Review with Well 
Developed features in 1.1 and 1.2 (The Instructional Core) and 3.4 (School Culture). The strongest impact can be seen 
in the four-year graduation rate, which increased nearly twenty percentage points, from 55% to nearly 75% last year; 
98% of graduates were accepted to college; 85% attend four-year colleges and universities.  

In addition to the above achievements, Hillcrest High School students have access to the following programs:  

1.  Full Music and Art Program open to all students 
2.  Virtual Enterprise Program with NYS CTE Endorsement 
3.  Computer Assisting Design and Computer Assisted Manufacturing Classes (STEM)with NYS CTE Endorsement 
4.  Software Engineering Program (STEM) 
5.  Nurse Assisting Certification with NYS CTE Endorsement 
6.  Saturdays at Hillcrest Students/Community/Parent Classes

In Media Arts and Music, our award-winning Model United Nations class offers opportunities for students 
from around the world to meet in various host cities and begin crafting resolutions to very modern and real 
world problems that directly mirror the efforts of the United Nations. Last year MUN students won over 
thirteen awards, including Best Delegation in two conferences. 

  Council for Unity is a class in Public Service and Law that specializes in reducing violence in schools and 

communities by empowering individuals and groups with the skills necessary to promote family unity, self-
esteem and empowerment.  

  HOSA Future Healthcare Professionals (HOSA) provides students real-world opportunities through 

internships with Surgeon Generals office, collaboration with health care professionals, and numerous 
conferences. The organization supports the Health Sciences CTE classes by strengthening student’s academic 
and technical skills through local, state and national level competitions. In the 2013-2014 year, nine students 
will be attending the National HOSA Conference after winning medals, including two gold, in the state 
conference. 

  Our Theatre SLC has partnered with LeAp OnStage, a high profile, comprehensive theater program for 

economically disadvantaged and culturally isolated NYC public school students. LeAp OnStage works with 
Hillcrest to strengthen our high-quality playwriting, performing, directing, and theatre production and 
appreciation program. Within the program, students write and perform plays, have real-world experiences 
with Broadway playwrights, directors and actors, and attend Broadway productions. In a city-wide 
competition, senior Jazmine Lopez’s play, Wicked Wealth, was selected to be performed off-Broadway in June 
2014.

$19,900,985 in additional scholarships awarded to Hillcrest High School students. 

These are just some of the unique opportunities available to our students and illustrate the mission of Hillcrest High 
School: 

 

"The mission of Hillcrest High School is to provide all students with a coherent and rigorous academic environment in 
which students are challenged to think critically and demonstrate mastery to prepare for college, careers, and 21st 
century real-world problem solving."  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

English Language Learners 

Located in Jamaica, Queens, the most ethnically diverse region in the United States, Hillcrest High School supports a 
student body population of around 3,300 students. Of these, an average of 1,700 (over 50%) come from homes where 
English is not the primary language. Within this group, around 650 students are currently eligible for ENL support. 
Approximately 100 are former English Language Learners (F-ELLs), and 550 are current English Language Learners 
(ELLs). 

Our ELLs are comprised of many subgroups. Our ENL Program uses these categories to provide individualized, 
differentiated support for all students: 

Former English Language Learners (F-ELLs) 

As stated above, 100 of our current ELLs are F-ELLs, or students who have received either a Commanding level (CM) 
on the most recent two years of NYSESLAT, or they have scored Expanding level (EX) and a passing level on the 
Common Core English Language Arts (CC ELA) regents exam. These students are provided with at least 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL co-teaching per week according to the regulations in CR Part 154.2. 

Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education (SIFE) 

For over a decade, Hillcrest has supported around 200 SIFE each year in our program. Recently, our numbers of SIFE 
have dropped based on the new demographics and descriptions of SIFE per CR 154.2. Nevertheless, we continue to 
support our SIFE through full adherence to ENL programming as well as providing a robust Title III after school 
program and Saturday Academy. Within these supplemental programs, we also offer personal training and assistance 
with college applications, life skills, and leadership opportunities with programs such as Council for Unity (CfU). SIFE 
are also given multiple opportunities each year to enrich their understanding of American culture and society through 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

college visits, trips to Broadway and other art venues, and out-of-state, over-night trips to places with extensive 
history such as Washington D.C., Boston, and Philadelphia. 

Refugees 

In the past few years, the numbers of students who come to us through our zoned Refugee Centers has increased 
dramatically. Last year (2016), almost 100 students came to us via the Refugee Center from various parts of Central 
America and Southeast Asia. While similar in many respects to SIFE, these students also have the added challenge, in 
most instances, of also travelling undocumented and unaccompanied by family members. Placed with sponsors, many 
students struggle with attending school full-time while finding ways to support their daily needs. Clearly, our refugee 
students need our support from a variety of angles, particularly socio-emotional. We utilize our extra funding to the 
best of our ability to provide counseling, supplemental courses, leadership opportunities, College Now programs, etc., 
to this subgroup of our population. 

Long Term ELLs 

 

Approximately 40% of our ELLs are not on track for graduation. Most of these students are also not making sufficient 
progress on their yearly NYSESLAT scores. To meet the needs of these students, we provide them with many of the 
services listed for other subgroups above along with regular meetings with our SLC director, bilingual guidance 
counselors, Parent Coordinator, ENL/Bilingual Coordinator, Attendance Teacher. Long-term ELLs are also provided 
with special courses inside our program to address their academic and social needs. 

Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) Program: Spanish 

Students who opt to be in our bilingual Spanish program are provided at least two content classes (history, math, and 
science) in Spanish. These courses determine language use and other forms of pedagogy based on our Language 
Allocation Policy (LAP), with an understanding that in these classes students will learn in both Spanish and English 
with a gradual progress toward English development. Furthermore, students in this program are given a Home 
Language Arts (HLA) course in Spanish, which emphasizes culture, history and art from the Spanish-speaking parts of 
the world. 

Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) Program: Bengali 

For the first time this school year, Hillcrest High School will provide a TBE program in Bengali. Currently we are 
offering math and history in Bengali, along with guidance from our bilingual Bengali counselor. Moving forward, we 
will add a science component as well as a Home Language Arts (HLA) series to these course offerings. 

Students with Individualized Education Plans 

Hillcrest High School has an inclusive environment to support our students who learn “differently” in the classroom. 
We provide over 12 sections of SETSS classes for our IEP students that are educated in the general education 
classroom, as well as over 55 sections of Integrated Co-teaching (ICT) classes to support students in regents level 
courses. In addition, we offer self-contained classes for our struggling 9th and 10th graders in required core regents 
courses. During the time students are in the self-contained classes they are continuously being assessed and moved to 
ICT and general education classes based on their abilities. This allows all students the opportunity to learn in their 
least restrictive environment. Hillcrest also offers IEP students who are not successful with their first attempt at taking 
required regent exams the chance to take self-contained “skills” classes in their individual areas of need or SETSS 
classes for addition help before taking the exam again. In addition, to ICT, self-contained, and SETSS, Hillcrest has two 
complete sections (5 course each) of Alternate Assessment students. This provides students that may not be on a 
regents or local diploma track the opportunity to learn in a community school with additional supports. All students

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Hillcrest has made great strides in the Framework elements related to Rigorous Instruction and creating a Supportive 
Environment. This is evident in the feedback from the Quality Review and results from the School Quality Guide. For 
the upcoming school year we will continue to encourage our students and staff to demonstrate a growth mindset. 
The theme for this year is ““Nurturing Persistence Every Day”, this theme will be evident in this year’s instructional 
focus on assessment and feedback.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After reviewing last year’s PPO and Quality Review feedback, in addition to teacher observations/ADVANCE, student 
work products and assessments, there needs to be a continued school-wide focus on supervisory feedback and 
professional development in the areas related to assessment/student feedback, and planning for multiple entry 
points in lesson plans. These initiatives are consistent with Danielson Domains 1 (Planning and Preparation) and 3 
(Instruction).  

As a result of our comprehensive needs assessment the school community developed a school wide instructional 
vision for how students learn best: 

  Our vision for learning is that teaching engages, values and challenges all learners continuously. 
  This vision is seen in our learning community when students are pursuing their learning both independently 

 

and with support fueled by a cycle of assessment, feedback, and goal setting. 
Interactions among members of our learning community promote respect, responsibility, trust, and rigorous 
thinking.  

  Our teaching uses 21st century methods, resources and tools to ensure our students achieve their academic, 

college and career goals. 

  Teachers use empirical data sources (Skedula/Department Scholarship/Formative and Summative Assessment 

to inform rigorous instructional practices 

  Teachers inform students, through clear expectations (i.e., syllabi, uniform grading policy, department grading 

policy) about progress in meeting standards 

In addition we revised our school wide instructional focus for the 2018 - 2019 school year: 

Hillcrest’s Instructional Focus 

If students are provided with meaningful feedback and multiple opportunities to effectively revise their work as well 
as monitor their own progress, then they will be empowered to improve their work. 

Students will: 

Self-assess/peer assess based on assessment criteria. 

 
  Revise and reflect on their results on assessments  
  Track their data on assessments and set goals to improve their performance 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

Teachers will: 

  Promote and model a growth mindset. 
  Provide rubrics that outline clear assessment criteria. 
  Provide small group instruction and one-to-one conferences with students. 
  Provide timely, specific and accurate feedback to students so that they have opportunities to make revisions 

and move toward next steps. 
Incorporate checks for understanding (turn & talk, entrance tickets, exit tickets). 

 
  Plan a variety of learning activities that have multiple entry point to increase student engagement during 

independent work. 

  Engage students in meaningful discussions so that the teacher serves as the facilitator, while asking questions 

that elicit evidence of students’ understanding. 

Principal/Assistant Principals will: 

  Provide timely and specific feedback to teachers about their instructional and assessment practices. 
  Provide professional development opportunities focused on growth mindset, assessment, and feedback that 

are tailored to teachers’ needs. 

  Create and monitor systems and structures to ensure that teachers are using assessment data to provide 

students with the supports needed to make progress and maintain a growth mindset. 

Student achievement data has improved, but there is still a need to focus on teacher performance and classroom 
instruction so we can close the credit and regents gaps and prepare students for the rigor of the common core and 
the challenges of college and career. As a school community, we have made much progress in the area of rigorous 
instruction, but the fact remains we need to graduate more than 71% of the graduating Cohort. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
A successful school requires classrooms where strong curricula, aligned to the Common Core, challenges students, 
scaffolds their experience, and is enlivened by educators who are engaged with their craft. Rigorous instruction aligns 
practice and content to Common Core strategies within and across grades. The results of this work is seen in a school's 
graduation rate. In comparing the 2017-2018 graduation rate (71% ), to the projected 2018-2019 graduation rate, by 
August 2019 our school graduation rate will have increased by 3%. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will receive feedback on their teaching, specifically 
Danielson components 1F (Designing Student Assessments), 3B 
(Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3C (Engaging 
Students in Learning, and 3D (Using Assessment in Instruction) 
through a process of informal and formal observations in 
ADVANCE. Observation will be followed by meaningful feedback 
between the evaluator and teacher. This process is the 
accountability lens to ensure that rigorous quality teaching and 
learning takes place every day, every period in every class. Each 
Assistant Principal Supervision develops and implements a 
visitation schedule that results in every teacher being visited 
multiple times a year. 

Teachers, in conjunction with the Assistant Principal Supervision, 
will develop individualized goals and PD Action Plans aligned 
with the Danielson Framework for measuring effective teaching, 
including Danielson components 1F (Designing Student 
Assessment), 3B (Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 
3C (Engaging Students in Learning) and 3D (Using Assessment in 
Instruction). A key point of emphasis is the assessment of English 
as a New Language Students and ISS students through 
interventions by the Global Citizens Small Learning Community 
that focuses on sheltered instruction techniques, and 
Instructional Support Collaborative Team Teaching classes. 
Teachers are expected to provide accurate, constructive and 
specific feedback to students in order to move learning forward. 

Provide professional development to teaching staff and support 
staff in terms of providing varied entry points for at-risk, SWD 
and ELL students. 

Provide time for ICT pairs to collaborate and plan effective 
classroom instruction that meets the needs of our special 
populations.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The following data from the 17-18 NYC School Quality Guide identifies the satisfaction level of students at Hillcrest 
High School in the area of supportive environment - personal attention and support: 

 
Personal Attention and Support - Overall Response was 61% 

Specific Questions that resonated with the School Leadership Team during the needs assessment:  

  62% of students say that teachers help them catch up if they are behind. (Q3a) 
  59% of students say that teachers notice if they have trouble learning something. (Q3b) 

The School Leadership team analyzed Hillcrest's New York State Report Card and surfaced that their is a need to 
provide additional support to our male students. We noted the gap in the graduation rate when comparing our males 
to our females: 

  MALE - FOUR-YEAR GRADUATION-RATE (Class of 2016): 62% 
 

FEMALE - FOUR-YEAR GRADUATION-RATE (Class of 2016): 81% 

This student data above indicates that there needs to be a focus on improving how we support all students who are 
struggling as well as the male students who are not engaged in the school community.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the school's focus on assessment and feedback at the classroom level, growth mindset, and targeted 
activities and recognition of our male students will result in a 10% increase by students on the Personal Attention and 
Support section of the NYC School Survey.

and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At Hillcrest, structures are in place so teacher collaboration is a culture rather than a practice. However the 
feedback from our last Quality Review identified element 4.2: "Engage in structured professional collaborations on 
teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning" as an 
area of focus. In addition, according to data from our School Performance Dashboard students earning 10 or more 
credits has dipped below the borough average for years one, two and three: 

HS - Credits Year 1 - 80.2% 
HS - Credits Year 2 - 67.9% 
HS - Credits Year 3 - 74.2% 
 
In addition Hillcrest, in collaboration with the UFT, has opened a Teacher's Center and has hired a Peer Collaborative 
Teacher who will support their colleagues through focused coaching, inter-visitations, and designing meaningful 
opportunities for growth.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 19, teachers will collaborate utilizing an inquiry process for the review of data to inform instructional and 
curricular decisions, leading to a 5% increase in credit accumulation in years one, two and three.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Evidence has shown that most areas of student data have improved over the last ten years but there is still a need to 
focus on teacher performance and classroom instruction, so we can continue to close the gaps on student 
achievement and prepare students for the challenges of post-secondary education and careers. Reviewing the MOTP 
data from the 2017-2018 school year, we have discovered deficits in the areas 1e Designing Coherent Instruction, 3B 
Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3C Engaging Students in Learning and 3D Using Assessments in 
Instruction. Uniform or common assessments are being utilized, created and analyzed in an effective manner, but the 
day to day formative assessment in the classroom needs to be improved. The challenges discovered in 3D have a 
strong effect on the other three competencies. 

In addition, the recent 2015-2016 Quality Review findings identified 4.2 as an area of focus. Highlighting the need to 
continue to ensure the majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations. This 
feedback was also supported by teacher responses to the Effective School Leadership questions from the latest School 
Quality Guide: 

  91% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their school, the principal/school leader encourages 

feedback through regular meetings with parent and teacher leaders. (Q9e) 

  79% of teachers reported that they have a moderate to great deal of influence over school policy in the area 

of selecting instructional materials used in classrooms. (Q12c) 

  84% of teachers reported that they have a moderate to great deal of influence over school policy in the area 

of developing instructional materials. (Q12d) 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By May 2019 the supervisory staff of Hillcrest High School will have conducted 100% of the required cycles of 
observations. Feedback will be timely, specific, and include actionable next steps, specifically in the area of assessment 
(3D). We will utilize this goal to strengthen teacher practice in the area of formative assessment due to its direct impact 
on student achievement. As a result, 85% of the teacher observation ratings in component 3D, will be effective or highly 
effective, by June of 2019.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Hillcrest High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Elementary and Secondary School Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Hillcrest High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under ; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Data analysis and Inquiry Work from previous years has shown that ELLs at Hillcrest who are 
given supplemental literacy and academic courses after school and on Saturdays are able to 
perform better in their regular academic classes and on standardized, high stakes assessments. 
Targeted data from summative assessments in content areas such as ELA and social studies have 
shown dramatically different results for ELLs at Hillcrest who participated in our after school 
and Saturday classes. Additionally, our teachers express joy in being able to expand their 
curriculum to include after school and Saturday enrichment. They tell us that students who 
participate in the extra classes achieve much higher scholarship (85%-90% average) in their 
regular classwork vis-à-vis students who do not take advantage of these offerings (65%-70% 
average). Our supplemental academic programs give teachers the opportunity to work with their 
students in small group settings. In turn, students are given more feedback and personalized 
instruction, often in one-on-one settings with their teacher or other students.After School 
Program 
The Title III After School Program, “Passport to Success” will run for 15 weeks during the 
months of November, December, and January and resuming in April and May. Supplemental 
academic courses will be offered twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Supplemental

Begin description here:            
With the New Generation Learning Standards taking the place of Common Core, and enhanced 
understanding of effective pedagogy as revealed in Danielson’s Framework for Teachers 
(ADVANCE), it is vital that our ENL teachers stay abreast of best practices, and learn from one 
another how to achieve these goals and objectives in their classroom. Furthermore, research has 
shown that teachers who engage in the Inquiry Process are better equipped to help each of their 
students succeed on a granular level. By doing this, teachers have shown vast improvements in 
the way they differentiate and provide multiple entry points to each of their students during daily 
instruction and during after school / Saturday supplemental programs. 
Throughout November and December (3 sessions a month for 2 months for a total of 6 sessions 
Fall Semester) and May and June (2 sessions a month for 2 months for a total of 4 sessions 
Spring Semester), 3 ENL teachers and 3 content-area teachers will meet to perform Inquiry 
Work for our ELL population. The content-area teachers will come from the Global Citizens 
SLC, and their classes will be comprised of 100% ELLs from our Bilingual Spanish TBE 
program, Bilingual Bengali TBE program, and from our Freestanding ENL program. The PD 
sessions will be held on Monday afternoons from 4 pm to 6 pm. During this time, the Assistant

Analysis of Granular Student Data from all major Regents exams via the New Visions Student 
Sorter 
Building Capacity and Scaffolds for the new Social Studies Regents Exams in Global and US 
Literacy Structures and Strategies for SIFE and Newcomer Populations Technology as a Tool for 
ESL Classrooms Some of these topics may be given in more than one workshop.

Based on needs assessments, our professional development workshops will be geared to 
positively address and meet student needs. Data will be gathered before, during, and after the 
workshops to see what, if any, positive impacts have been made in student progress in 
scholarship, Regents passing rates, and NYSESLAT performance each year. It is believed that by 
sharing best practices and training all teachers of ELLs in imperial pedagogical practices such as 
scaffolding that we will see a positive increase in student performance in all of the above areas. 
Records for Professional Development will be kept by the supervisors in charge of the program. 
These will include agendas, sign-in sheets, and any additional materials used and distributed at 
the sessions. Teaches will be paid per session according to current contractual rates and 
allocations, and they will submit time sheets and time cards twice monthly during the

Begin description here:            
At Hillcrest High School we firmly believe that parents of English Language Learners should 
play an active role in their child’s education. Furthermore, we believe that specifically-targeted, 
supplemental parent workshops for parents of ELLs enhance what is already present for parents 
in the regularly scheduled DOE calendar (such as Parent/Teacher Conferences). Our parents 
have mentioned to us during interviews and meetings that they appreciate it when we open our 
doors to them so they can learn the expectations of a NYC DOE high school education as well as 
learn what their children will need to matriculate naturally into colleges and careers in the future.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Finally, we know that it is best practice to inform parents on a regular basis of their child's 
progress through his or her education. As such, our Title III program will offer several 
opportunities throughout the year to participate in this supplemental program. 
Parent Involvement Workshops and Celebrations 
Three times a year, once in November, once in April, and once in May, our ELL population will 
hold a Parent Involvement Workshop to celebrate the achievements of our ELLs and to provide 
essential academic informational to parents.These events will take place on Friday afternoons 
from 5 pm to 7 pm. Ten (10) teachers will participate in these events, five (5) ENL-certified 
teachers and five (5) content-area teachers. Assistant Principal ENL will supervise this event at 
no cost to the program. Teachers will play different roles during the event: Some will be in 
charge of an awards ceremony honoring the top performing students in academic excellence, 
attendance, and overall participation in the Title III “Passport to Success” program. Other 
teachers will offer workshops in the following four areas: 
1) College Readiness and the FAFSA process; 
2) Computer Technology and Parent Connection to the School and Child’s Education; 
3) ENL and English Survival Skills; 
4) Citizenship in America. 
Other teachers will hold “Office Hours” so parents and students can do one-on-one check-ins for 
the student’s academic progress and make concrete next steps to successful high school 
graduation and beyond. 
Projected number of parents is 300. 
Tentative dates for the 2018-2019 SY ENL program meetings are: 
Friday, November 16th 
Friday, March 22nd 
Friday, May 24th 
Parents will be notified of these events through a variety of methods: phone outreach, 
backpacking invitations, Parent Coordinator outreach, etc. The school will take proactive 
measures with the Translation/Interpreting Office to provide parents information in their native 
languages. We will also use funds from our own Translation/Interpreting budget to advertise 
these events. 
 
Records for Parent Engagement Activities will be created and kept by the supervisors in charge 
of the parent program. These will include agendas, sign-in sheets, and any additional materials 
used during the sessions. Teachers involved with these programs will also submit time cards and 
time sheets for these events. 
Outreach for our Parent Engagement Activities will include: parent letters in English, Bengali 
and Spanish. This will be distributed to all students to give to their parents and guardians at least 
once during the program. Skedula messages will also be sent twice in English and Spanish to the 
entire school community. Finally, a phone message in English and Spanish will be send via our 
phone messenger. Using our Title I Interpretation/Translation funding, we will employ two 
Bengali-speaking faculty to outreach to our Bengali population. We will also produce 
information regarding the program in Arabic and Urdu using the DOE Interpretation Unit.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  
Currently our primary diagnostic tools for literacy are the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB.  From the NYSITELL, we gather 
information regarding the early literacy skills of the ELLs, who are subsequently programmed into Entering, Emerging, 
Transitioning, and Expanding courses as indicated by their proficiency on these exams.  The school's instructional plan is then 
monitored to ensure that the proper sitting minutes and modalities of instruction are given to all students according to their 
ELL level and program selection choice. 
 
If the student is potentially SIFE, then the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire, the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS), and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

the Writing Screener are administered within the first ten school days of enrollment to determine the student’s literacy skills 
and provide him or her with appropriate instructional program. 
 
Throughout the school year, teacher and/or AP-designed exams are created and administered in all major subject areas (e.g., 
English, math, history, and science) at least four times throughout the year, generally corresponding with the end of each 
major marking period.  Results of these exams are analyzed by the respective content area teams, including the Assistant 
Principals of supervision, to determine next steps for in-class pedagogy and supplemental support. 
  
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
Our ENL/Bilingual Coordinator uses data from NYSITELL and parent meetings to inform next steps for the bilingual Guidance 
Counselors and AP ENL.  From that data, students are programmed and given supplemental ENL services according to their 
needs. 
 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  
Evaluation of the success of our ELL programs comes from a variety of sources:  At the beginning of each year we analyze data 
from the previous year’s NYSESLAT.  We use information from our Periodic Assessments in all major content areas (history, 
math, science and English ) to inform our understanding of student growth and to determine next steps.  
  
To make adequate yearly progress (AYP), we make every effort to show that each of our ELL subgroup has met the state 
proficiency goal in reading and math.  On top of the math and reading tests, ELLs also must meet certain English proficiency 
benchmarks on the NYSESLAT, as stated above.    
  
To make this happen, we do the following at Hillcrest High School: 
  
1. Test students early and often;  
2. Improve the quality of assessments for ELL students (including all additional native language tests);  
3. Ensure that all ELL students receive the full range of services they need—both to bring them to English profi ciency as well as 
to improve their performance on academic content areas;  
4. improve teacher training opportunities so teachers can better meet the needs of such students.  
  
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
Review of periodic assessments takes place with all content area teachers who oversee ELLs and F-ELLs in our school.  When 
student results indicate need of additional academic support, teachers utilize several structures to address those needs, 
including but not limited to: 
 
1) Weekly small-group or individual tutoring during teachers' Circular Six periods. 
2) After school and Saturday Title III programs. 
3) Summer-in-the-City Title III programs. 
4) Individualized support from bilingual Guidance Counselors and/or SLC Director(s) 
 
All bilingual and ENL teachers are trained in ENL interventions (RtI) and scaffolding to provide additional,

differentiated support in the classroom.  This on-going PD is provided to teachers through direct supervision from AP ENL as 
well as teacher-led Inquiry work that takes place bi-monthly during our after school, department-specific PD Wednesdays.  
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
N/A  
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
All current ELLs are tested each May using the NYSESLAT.  Students in our bilingual Spanish program also receive the ELE each 
year.  Results of these exams are analyzed in late August each year by the LAP and/or LPT teams to determine next steps for 
the programming and curriculum choices for each student. 
 
Results of all New York State Regents exams are also used as a guide for our instructional planning for ELLs.  Students who take 
and pass regents in a timely manner are subsequently programmed for the courses that follow standard sequence in English, 
history, math and science.  Students who are not able to pass their regents exams are provided support both during the 
regular school day and in supplemental activities after school, in Saturday programs, and during our summer programs. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ENL Coordinator, AP ENL, and bilingual Guidance Counselor are all informed of these findings after each major testing period 
an in late August.  Based on the data, we make adjustments to our programs to best support the needs of each student as 
outlined in CR Part 154.2. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) Program 
  
Qualified ENL students who choose our Freestanding English as a New Language Program (ENL) are placed in leveled, 
self-contained classes taught by certified teachers in both ENL and all their content classes.  Our Freestanding ENL 
program is organized to serve students from a variety of different language and cultural backgrounds.  We offer 28 
periods (48 minutes each) of ENL classes daily; approximately half of these sections are taught by either dually 
certified ELA & ENL teachers, or an ELA certified teacher co-teaches with an ENL certified instructor. 
  
Based on the results of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL, students are scheduled for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and 
Expanding classes.  Student in the Entering classes receive 720 minutes/week of ENL instruction (48 minutes x 3 
classes x 5 days).  Students in the Emerging and Transitioning classes receive 480 minutes/week of ENL instruction (48 
minutes x 2 classes x 5 days).  Students in Expanding classes receive 240 minutes/week of ENL instruction (48 minutes 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

x 1 class x 5 days), in addition to being registered into ELA courses.  
  
Students in both of our ENL programs receive ample minutes in ENL instructional, regardless of their proficiency 
levels. The additional time is utilized to develop reading fluency and vocabulary building through computer assisted 
programs and carefully scaffolded lesson plans.  Content area classes benefit from the additional minutes as ENL 
language teachers review content-specific vocabulary and curricula with ELLs.  ELLs reaching proficiency on the 
NYSESLAT are allowed to enter other SLCs in our school; however, they continue to be included in supplemental 
instructional programs such as our Title III PM activities. Furthermore, they receive accommodations during exams for 
two years after exiting the ENL programs. Mainstream teachers are reminded to make dictionaries available to these 
students in their regular classes and to provide F-ELLs with additional time and, when necessary, additional listening 
comprehension.  
  
At Hillcrest, Freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home 
language support, emphasizing English language acquisition.  Students in our freestanding ENL programs come from 
many different language backgrounds, and English is the only common language among the students.  At Hillcrest, we 
have examples of both types of ENL as determined by CR Part 154:  
  
• Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content 
courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  A student does not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core content 
area instruction.  
  
• Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a 
dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area 
teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction 
include content area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies.  At Hillcrest, all ELLs and 
former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.  
  
At Hillcrest, we use self-contained model: ELLs are grouped together in an ENL class, usually for the entire school day 
and for all content instruction.  
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

  
Transitional Bilingual Education Program (Spanish and Bengali) 
  
About 30% of our ELLs, or about 140 students, are enrolled in the Transitional Bilingual Education Spanish program.   
 
About 20% of our ELLs, or about 100 students, will be enrolled in our new bilingual Bengali TBE program. 
 
In addition to following the same track for ENL as stated above, students in these programs are given 3 or 4 subject 
area classes with certified bilingual instructors who follow the Language Allocation Policy (LAP) of the school when 
conducting instruction in the students' home language.  TBE classes include students from Spanish and Bengali 
backgrounds who scored Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding on the NYSESLAT 2017.  Bilingual classes 
are taught in all major content areas with certified teachers who hold bilingual extensions.  These currently include 
Social Studies (Global and US History), math (Integrated Algebra and Geometry), and science (Living Environment or 
Earth Science).   
 
Altogether, there are twelve (12) bilingual Spanish classes at Hillcrest this year; nine (9) sections of bilingual Bengali. 
  
Home Language Arts (HLA) 
  
Students enrolled in our TBE Program are provided with one (1) section of HLA every day.  These classes are taught by 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

certified instructors of Spanish; in the case of bilingual Bengali, HLA sections are taught by our Bengali global history 
teacher, who supplements his history curriculum with literature and writing prompts from original Bangla sources.   
 
In all HLA situations, students use the four modalities (listening, reading, writing and speaking) to interact with 
rigorous, grade-level materials in Spanish.  All lessons are aligned to Common Core State Standards. 
  
At Hillcrest, our transitional bilingual education (TBE) programs are  designed so that students develop conceptual 
skills in their home language as they learn English. All instruction is Common Core-aligned to accelerate student 
achievement. 
 
As students (all ELLs) develop English language skills, time in the home language decreases. When ELLs reach 
proficiency on the NYSESLAT, they are placed in a monolingual class in English with home language supports.  To help 
with this, Hillcrest has created a consistent plan for the use of each language for instruction, and a supportive 
transition plan for students when they are transferred into the monolingual English program, as required in CR Part 
154.2. 
  
Our TBE program is predicated on transferring literacy skills from a student’s home language to a student’s new 
language (English). Students acquire literacy most effectively in the language most familiar to them.  At Hillcrest, skills 
used in home language acquisition (e.g., making sense of print, using writing to communicate, playing with language 
structure, developing vocabulary) are skills that a student can use for faster and more successful acquisition of English 
literacy—a concept known as “linguistic interdependence.” 
 
In our TBE program, students transfer home language skills to English by spending instructional time primarily in the 
home language before steadily transitioning to English. At the beginning/entering level, TBE students are expected to 
receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English. As a student’s English proficiency increases, 
more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English. In TBE programs, teachers must make several 
considerations when determining which language is best to teach certain concepts. Teachers must consider carefully 
the intellectual demand of concepts, student familiarity with concepts in the home language and English, and the 
academic language required for using and mastering concepts. 
 
TBE teachers are critical to ELLs’ transition from home language to English since they serve as language models for 
both; therefore, they must demonstrate strong academic language proficiency when delivering instruction in either 
language. Successful TBE teachers help students cultivate a strong appreciation for reading. These teachers ensure 
that ELLs are familiar and comfortable with reading by helping them develop strong literacy skills in their home 
language first. Also, TBE teachers are likely to instruct students with various levels of content mastery and literacy 
development. While variations are similar to those found in general education classrooms, TBE teachers face the 
additional challenge of gauging and instructing students with different proficiency levels in their home language as 
well as in English.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
At Hillcrest High School, Freestanding ENL students who are at an Entering level of English are assigned 3 units of study per 
week.  Altogether, they are given 2 classes in ENL and 1 class in Integrated ELA.  Each class is 48 minutes long, totaling 720 
minutes of English instruction per week. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Freestanding ENL students who are at an Emerging level and Transitioning level are assigned 2 unites of study per 
week.  Altogether, they are given 1 unit of study in an integrated ENL/ELA class, which meets 5 times a week for 48 minutes a 
lesson (240 minutes); they are also given a stand-alone ENL class for the same amount of time.  In total, they have 480 minutes 
of English instruction every day. 
  
Freestanding ENL students who are expanding are provided with 1 unit of study of an integrated ENL/ELA class.  These courses 
meet 5 times a week for 48 minutes a session (240 minutes).  In addition, these students are programmed for an additional 
English class each day with an ELA certified teacher. 
  
Former ELLs (F-ELLs) are programmed for the same additional ENL/ELA integrated course as our expanding students. 
  
For students who are in our Transitional Bilingual Program, one period of Home Language Arts (HLA) in Spanish is provided in 
their programs daily.  These students study HLA for 240 minutes each week. 
  
For students in our Transitional Bilingual Program who are entering, three (3) content area courses are taught in a bilingual 
setting: history, math and science.  For emerging and transitioning students, at least two of three content area courses are 
taught in a bilingual setting.  For expanding students, one content area course is taught in a bilingual setting.  In every case, 
these courses are taught by teachers with subject specific license and certification.  Furthermore, several of the teachers who 
teach bilingual education at Hillcrest have bilingual certification; starting September 2017, four more teachers will begin the 
process of receiving bilingual certifications. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
In both Freestanding ENL and in our Transitional Bilingual Programs, content area teachers in history, math, and science focus 
on these key elements to make content comprehensible to our ELLs at Hillcrest, as well as help them meet the demands of the 
CCSS. 
  
Our teachers:  
- explicitly teach academic vocabulary 
- integrate oral and written language instruction into content area teaching  
- provide regular, structured opportunities to read for multiple purposes  
- provide regular, structured opportunities to write  
- capitalize on students’ home language skills and knowledge  
  
In content area classes at Hillcrest, we recognize the four levels of proficiency and literacy for ELLs—entering, emerging, 
transitioning, and expanding.  Scaffolds are not included for students at the commanding level because students at that level 
may not need additional support.   At Hillcrest, ELLs at all levels of proficiency have access to scaffolds that provide multiple 
means of representation, action and expression, and engagement.  ELLs at the entering and emerging levels of proficiency 
have access to text and instructions in their home language as well as in English.  In addition, they have sentence frames to 
help them respond to text-dependent questions posed  
throughout the lesson.  ELLs at the transitioning levels of proficiency have access to sentence starters.  All students at these 
levels, as well as ELLs at the expanding level of proficiency, have access to word banks to help them engage in partner 
conversation and answer text-dependent questions.  Teachers differentiate further to meet the needs of students in their 
classrooms.  For example, for students at transitioning and expanding levels of proficiency, teachers might reduce the 
background knowledge provided, vocabulary taught, and supplementary questions asked and their use of other scaffolds such 
as graphic organizers that make content presented in a second languages more accessible.  For students at the transitioning 
and expanding levels of proficiency, teachers might provide students with text in their home language prior to reading the text 
in English even if the goal of instruction is English literacy. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

  
At Hillcrest, the scaffolding methods used in our content area classes include teachers defining target words in context, 
teachers modeling routines before students try them, students repeating target words and phrases, teachers providing 
pictures to accompany the target words, and teachers using gestures and visuals to help reinforce word meanings.  For ELLs, 
additional practice is very helpful, and we find time to do this in our afterschool Title III, SIFE, and Title I activities. 
  
In content areas at Hillcrest, we establish rigorous expectations for all learners, including English language learners (ELLs). 
Although these standards present challenges, they create opportunities to more fully incorporate ELLs into standards-based 
reform. The CCSS in mathematics include a focus on the mathematical content required for students at each grade level and 
also include Standards for Mathematical Practice that apply in different ways across all grade levels. The eight Standards for 
Mathematical Practice are the following: 
 
1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.  
2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.  
3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.  
4. Model with mathematics.  
5. Use appropriate tools strategically.  
6. Attend to precision.  
7. Look for and make use of structure.  
8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.  
  
To help ELLs master these standards at Hillcrest, we make it a priority to have materials and methods that more fully support 
them in acquiring grade-level knowledge and skills. Effective methods for enabling ELLs to meet the CCSS build on approaches 
that are effective for all students, but they also provide additional support for ELLs who are learning content in an additional 
language. 
  
The scaffolds we use are primarily useful for supporting student’s receptive skills including their ability to process new 
concepts, organize ideas, and acquire academic language including new linguistic structures. Other scaffolds are primarily 
useful in supporting student’s productive skills that include communicating their mathematical thinking as well as seeking 
clarification about math content or language associated with math. These scaffolds may be used with ELLs at any level of 
English language proficiency, with variations in the levels of support predicated on students’ prior math knowledge and levels 
of English proficiency.  At Hillcrest, we encourage collaboration between mathematics teachers and bilingual teachers or 
teachers of ENL who can support mathematics teachers in scaffolding math curriculum and instruction for English language 
learners.  
  
In sum, our content area teachers employ the following scaffolds in our classrooms on a daily basis to help our ELLs meet the 
rigors of CCSS: 
 
- Explicitly teach academic vocabulary 
- Integrate oral and written language instruction into content area teaching 
- Concrete and visual models 
- Graphic organizers and foldables 
- Multimedia to enhance comprehension 
- Structured opportunities to speak with a partner or small group 
- Provide regular, structured opportunities to write  
- Sentence frames 
- Sentence starters 
- Build background knowledge  
- Focus on appropriate background knowledge for students 
- Enhance and expand background knowledge for teachers 
- Clarify content delivered in a second language

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All students enrolled in our TBE Spanish program are given the Spanish LAB test every year.  Furthermore, ELLs who have not 
met the language requirement for graduation are scheduled for language electives in Spanish, French or Latin. Each June we 
offer the LOTE exam to our students who speak Bengali, Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, etc. 
 
As we begin our bilingual Bengali program this fall, the school will reach out to DELLSS and other organizations to help us find 
appropriate evaluations for Bangla to use throughout the year. 
 
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
Differentiation for SIFE 
  
At the beginning of every semester, the AP ENL, the Director of Global Citizens Small Learning Community (SLC), the 
ENL/Bilingual Coordinator and their related guidance counselors perform a needs assessment of all SIFE by analyzing data 
retrieved from ATS.  Additionally, all ELL teachers conduct formal and informal formative assessments to identify students’ 
skills and areas in need of improvement; included in this Inquiry Work is the identification of SIFE. Once students are identified 
and appropriately placed, lessons are designed to differentiate to meet these students’ needs. Frequently this is accomplished 
through implementation of Tiered Instruction and additional scaffolding strategies. We have also incorporated Common Core 
Learning Standards (CCLS), Response to Intervention (RtI), the use of the Depth of Knowledge (DOK) charts, and multiple entry 
points. Finally, many teachers use technology to support students’ needs in reading, writing and overall fluency. Purchased 
software and on-line subscriptions include Achieve 3000, National Geographic Edge online reading coach, and Castle Learning 
programs. SIFE are enrolled in supplemental PM and Saturday programs supported by our Title III, Bilingual Enrichment, and 
SIFE programs. 
  
Differentiation for Newcomers 
  
For our newcomers at Hillcrest High School, we focus primarily on the language and literacy skills needed for content area 
learning.  Teachers provide explicit instruction in language and literacy skills (e.g., vocabulary instruction) within the context of 
meaningful purposes for reading and writing (e.g., to learn about the human circulatory system or to write a persuasive essay 
taking a position on U.S. foreign policy). This content-based approach anchors instruction in the literacy demands facing 
students encountering middle and high school texts, rather than in the remediation of “basic” reading skills.  In addition to the 
selection of which words to teach, the other important designing vocabulary instruction centers on striking a balance between 
direct teaching of word meanings in meaningful contexts and teaching word-learning strategies.  Effective comprehension 
instruction at Hillcrest High School is explicit and purposeful, engages students actively, and promotes students’ own 
understanding of the process of reading comprehension.  Our teachers attempt to define, explain, discuss, and reinforce good 
comprehension practices in multiple contexts and across different types (i.e., genres) of text.  At Hillcrest, our Newcomers also 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

receive intensive instruction in writing for academic purposes.  Effective writing instruction, like effective reading instruction, is 
guided by an understanding of the specific sources of students’ difficulties and/or targeted skills for improvement. Writing 
instruction for our Newcomers is integrated with instruction in academic language and reading comprehension in order to 
provide the kind of repetition that all ELLs—but especially our newcomers—require to develop proficiency in all aspects of 
literacy.  This begins with systematic assessment of students’ strengths and needs as well as ongoing monitoring of students’ 
progress.   Students with word-reading difficulties need targeted and explicit instruction in our after school Title III programs to 
promote their reading skills. 
  
Differentiation for Developing ELLs 
  
For our Developing ELLs, we create ENL classes that emphasize writing, academic vocabulary, active engagement, and oral 
language development.  Explicit literacy development is also a major focus, with instruction in the academic uses of English, 
high-quality writing, extensive reading of relevant texts, a focus on active student engagement and accountable participation, 
and an emphasis on academic language and complex vocabulary.  In our Freestanding ENL program, our students are mixed 
heterogeneously with strong native English speakers.  We structure our courses around a set of consistent routines, and 
engage students in setting goals and developing study skills. These classes are based on English Language proficiency standards 
and are aligned with grade level Common Core Language Arts standards to scaffold the language demands and language 
development needed for our Developing ELLs success.  For our Developing ELLs, we also insist on explicit academic language 
and literacy development across the curriculum.  Our design for all classes involved explicit language development, with a 
focus on comprehension, vocabulary development, and advanced grammatical structures needed to comprehend and produce 
academic language.   We strive to focus on academic language as needed for studying the specific academic content of the 
class.  To supplement this, we use primary language literacy development through our Home Language Arts classes. 
 
Differentiation for Long Term ELLs 
  
To help our Long Term ELLs, we focus on the following six ideas: 1. Reading and writing in English, both in class and at home 
takes on an important role in our instruction for Long Term ELLs.  To promote more reading and writing, students in this 
subgroup are given double periods with Common Core-aligned reading libraries.  Most teachers incorporate a "DEAR" protocol 
at least once a week where students "drop everything and read."  These students are also programmed into our Reading 
Assistant program on line.  2. Receiving specific instruction of vocabulary with definitions in any subject area along with direct 
teaching of the meaning of terms in context and other uses of the words.  3. At Hillcrest, our Long Term ELLs are programmed 
to work one-on-one with the teacher during our Thursday and Friday tutoring sessions. Students reported learning best when 
the teacher took the time to explain concepts or assignments individually, and then help them to complete the task.  4. 
Increased scaffolds such as modeling by the teacher also become more important for our Long Term ELLs. When the teacher 
modeled the task at hand with step-by-step instructions the students had a clear vision of what they needed to do and felt 
capable to complete the task.  5. Speaking with other students in English in all their classes builds oral English skills.  6. Taking 
learning seriously. Students reported that when they took the learning seriously.  To increase this socio-emotional skill, we 
incorporate counseling by certified counselors for each of our Long Term ELLs. 
  
Differentiation for Former ELLs (F-ELLs) for up to two years 
  
Former ELLs (F-ELLs) at Hillcrest are provided with all testing accommodations that we give to our ELLs (extended time, use of 
bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, third read for listening passages.)  These students are assigned to rooms that are separate 
from the larger group of students who are testing.  According to the new Chancellor's Regulation CR Part 154, we also program 
these students for an additional period of Integrated ENL at least twice a week.  For the most part, these are English classes co-
taught by ENL certified instructors.  Our ELLs also have access to all supplemental activities such as our Title III after school 
program.  Lastly, they are always invited to participate in our field trips and other enrichment activities for ELLs. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

  
To support our ELL-SWDs, we follow the following academic language development plan: 
  
All ENL classes follow a carefully structured instructional approach that develops literacy skills in the four language modalities: 
speaking, listening, reading and writing. This is accomplished through a number of activities that include but are not limited to: 
Read Alouds, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading, interactive reading, phonics, spelling, shared writing, 
guided writing, independent writing, and grammatical structures building. Additionally, carefully selected scaffolds are also 
incorporated into every lesson. These scaffolds include modeling, schema building, contextualization, bridging, meta-cognitive 
processes, and text representation. 
  
Entering: Focuses on phonetic awareness, listening discrimination and cooperative learning activities that facilitate speaking.   
Emerging and Transitioning: Build on skills in meta-cognition, sequencing and summarizing, compare and contrast, schema 
building, making predictions, and other academic skills. 
  
All ENL, ELA, and content area teachers meet bi-weekly during Common Planning Time within the Global Citizens SLC and with 
their respective content departments during bi-weekly departmental meetings with AP/academic specialists to discuss how to 
better service the ELLs. Collaborative Inquiry Teams meet weekly in their SLC (Small Learning Community) groups to collect and 
analyze students’ data in order to improve instruction. 
  
Currently all materials for ELLs correspond to the expectations of the Common Core; therefore, each of our grade levels, 9th 
through 12th, receive rigorous, engaging materials that push critical thinking skills, meta-cognition, and other forms of higher 
learning.  Although some argue that the material we are giving our ELLs is above their grade levels, we continue to provide 
“high expectations with high support” to ensure that our students become proficient in the skills necessary to compete in the 
21st Century. 
  
For our ELL-SWDs, services and resources are adapted in the following ways to correspond with their ages and grades, while 
being appropriate to their cognitive needs: providing comprehensible input for all content areas, making lessons visual and 
contextualized, linking new information to prior knowledge, determining key concepts for the unit and define language and 
content objectives for each lesson, modified vocabulary instruction, use of cooperative learning strategies, modifications to 
testing and homework expectations. 
  
Effective supports for our ELL-SWDs include but are not limited to: real-life objects, manipulatives, pictures/photos, 
illustrations, diagrams, drawings, videos, broadcasts, models, magazines, newspapers, materials in native language, charts, 
graphic organizers, tables, graphs, timelines, number lines, pairs/small groups, whole group instruction, peers and mentors. 
  
Materials are selected to be age appropriate and grade level.  High interest materials are also frequently selected. 
  
Instructional materials for ELLs currently include several sets of textbooks for ELL-SWDs and in the content areas that meet the 
requirements of the Common Core such as the RIGOR series from National Geographic.  In addition to these resources, we 
offer several digital / technological resources for ELLs such as National Geographic’s Edge, Castle Learning, Achieve 3000, 
Reading Assistant, and Stem Math from MIND Research. 
  
Materials that we use for Long-term ELL-SWDs include: Response to Intervention, English 3D parts I and II, Academic 
Vocabulary Tool Kit parts I and II, Renaissance Learning and Rosetta Stone. 
  
Materials that we use for our SIFE ELL-SWDs include: SIFE curriculum from Engage NY, RIGOR science and math, Reading 
Assistant and MySci Learn digital activities, SIFE Bridges Curriculum in English, history, math and science, Oral Interview 
Questionnaire from NYC DOE along with Literacy Evaluation for Newcomer SIFE (LENS). 
  
Materials that we use for TBE Spanish classes for ELL-SWDs in history, math and science as well as with our HLA curriculum 
include:  Spanish Native Language Arts Curriculum Guide (SNLACG), Envision Math Spanish, Foss Science Online Resources in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  
At Hillcrest, Global Citizens SLC specializes in meeting the needs of students who have recently arrived to the USA. Students in 
our SLC receive personalized instruction from pedagogues and counselors who are certified and trained to meet the needs of 
this unique subgroup.  All teachers of students with IEPs have opportunities for additional professional development that 
further deepens their understanding and expertise. Teachers in Newcomers rely on research-based strategies and techniques 
such as sheltered instruction and QTEL (WestED) methodology to meet the needs of our students with IEPs. 
  
Teachers have access to the IEPs, along with a variety of textbooks and other digitial resources such as MySciLearn Reading 
Assistant, Vision Literacy textbooks, EDGE textbooks, English 3D textbooks, Castle Learning Software, and the National 
Geographic Edge Online Coach Reading Fluency program. All of these resources are implemented according to SWD's 
proficiency levels and IEP recommendations. 
  
The majority of ELL-SWD are programmed in CTT classes where they have full access to the content teachers and receive 
support from the Special Ed teachers and the core curricula.  
  
Hillcrest High School ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers.  Whenever 
possible, ELL-SWDs are programmed for ICT classes.  
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
Content area classes (history, math, science, technology, art, music and health) are provided to all ELLs by certified instructors 
who are trained in scaffolding, sheltered instruction, and other forms of instruction for ELLs.  This year we will continue to 
implement the supplemental Title III, SIFE, and Bilingual Enrichment instructional and enrichment activities. ELLs are scheduled 
in two cohorts (2015-2016 and 2017-2018) for these instructional programs. Students receive instruction in content areas that 
are offered in addition to tutoring and regents preparation courses. Regents materials are available in every classroom and the 
computer online reading fluency coach is available to students in a computer lab and on newly purchased netbook computers 
and iPads.  For the past three years, our SLC has had its own state-of-the-art computer lab, which is utilized by all major 
subgroups in our school.  Finally, all newly enrolled ELLs attend the Title III summer program where ENL teachers engage in 
total immersion language acquisition activities in most of the major content areas. 
  
Our intervention programs target both our ENL and TBE programs.  For TBE Spanish, home language intervention is used for all 
history, math and science programs. 
  
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 
Throughout 2015-2016, the focus has shifted to major components of the Common Core.  In particular, ELLs students will 
engage in text-based questions and analytical debate and discussion in the classrooms, creating claims, counter-claims, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

supporting them.  Textual evidence will be required for all discussions and written response.  Teachers will select texts that 
contain higher levels of academic vocabulary while continuing to provided scaffolds and other forms of support. 
  
To promote this learning, we have chosen to add MySciLearn/Reading Assistant to our list of online support for ELLs.  Other 
programs include National Geographic’s Edge series, J-map for math and science, and Castle Learning for all major subject 
areas. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Textbooks or programs that do not meet the needs of the Common Core will be removed from the curriculum. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 
Each Small Learning Community (SLC) at Hillcrest High School has 450 students or less and has its own theme, course offerings, 
teachers, and guidance counselors.  Each of our eight 4-year SLC's is linked to career themes and has connections to the 
outside professional world.  Our eight 4-year SLC's are: Academy of Media Arts & Music, Pre-Med, Theatre, Teachers of 
Tomorrow, Public Service & Law, Business / Technology (BIZ / Tek), and Health Sciences.  Along with our SLC's, we have a most 
comprehensive Advance Placement or College Now Program.  Over 950 students are involved in some level of Advance 
Placement or College Now Program, including our ELLs.  
  
Extracurricular academic offerings at Hillcrest High School include but are not limited to: Virtual Enterprise, computer assisting 
design, software engineering, nurse assistant certification, Intel Research programs, Smith Barney Research Program, Mock 
Trial/Moot Court/Law Institute, CUNY College Now Programs with Queensborough and York College.  Advanced Placement 
classes include calculus, statistics, biology, environmental science, government, US history, English Literarture, Art History, 
Spanish literature and language, French language, and world history. 
  
Extracurricular activities in sports include basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, bowling, soccer, yoga, dance and cricket.   
  
We have an active theater, media, arts and music program.  Hillcrest High School sponsors at least eight major productions and 
presentations a year. 
 After school clubs include the Japanese Language Club, knitting, Christian Coilition, Robotics, among others 
  
For all of these activities and events, ELLs and F-ELLs are invited to participate along with the mainstream students through 
morning announcements in multiple languages and flyers that are distributed in different langauges as well.  We have a notice 
board in Global Citizens' SLC office that invites students to participate in these extracurricular clubs and activities.  This 
information is also periodically sent home to parents in their preferred languages. 
  
ELLs and F-ELLs are an active presence in all of the major extracurriular clubs and activities in our school.  We see them 
performing in arts and music, sports and clubs.  Our cricket team, for example, is one of the best in the city, and it comprised 
almost entirely of ELLs and F-ELLs.  Our baseball team is the same.  Our ELLs have also excelled in our after school clubs.  Most 
notably, our Robotics club recently won top awards for their work in robotics last year.  Almost every member of this team is 
an ELL or F-ELL, which was recognized at our school's graduation and other end-of-year events. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
As previously mentioned in this document, instructional materials for ELLs currently include several sets of textbooks for ESL 
and in the content areas that meet the requirements of the Common Core such as the RIGOR series from National 
Geographic.  In addition to these resources, we offer several digital / technological resources for ELLs such as National 
Geographic’s Edge, Castle Learning, Achieve 3000, Reading Assistant, and Stem Math from MIND Research.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is given to all students in our Spanish TBE program.  Students in this program are offered one period of 
HLA Spanish each semester until they achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  Our HLA teachers follow the new curriculum for 
HLA instruction provided by the DELLSS while also incorporating skills and strategies from the Common Core.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Currently all materials for ELLs correspond to the expectations of the Common Core; therefore, each of our grade levels, 9th 
through 12th, receive rigorous, engaging materials that push critical thinking skills, metacognition, and other forms of higher 
learning.  Although some argue that the material we are giving our ELLs is above their grade levels, we continue to provide 
“high expectations with high support” to ensure that our students become proficient in the skills necessary to compete in the

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We continue to implement the supplemental Title III, SIFE, and Bilingual Enrichment instructional and enrichment activities this 
school year. ELLs are scheduled in two cohorts for these instructional programs. Students receive instruction in content areas 
that are offered in addition to tutoring and regents preparation courses. Regents’ materials are available in every classroom 
and the computer online reading fluency coach is available to students in a computer lab and on newly purchased netbook 
computers and iPads.  This year, the school provided our SLC with its own state-of-the-art computer lab, which is utilized by all 
major subgroups in our school.  Finally, all newly enrolled ELLs attend the Title III summer program where ESL teachers engage 
in total immersion language acquisition activities.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL and content area teachers who teach ELLs have several opportunities to participate in professional development 
throughout the school year.  Our professional development plan includes instructional activities in our Common Planning Time, 
which focus upon questioning techniques, providing students with appropriate feedback, scaffolding strategies, using multiple 
entry points, Assessment for Learning (AFL), and incorporating Common Core Learning Standards.  Regarding CCLS, we will 
incorporate professional development regarding academic vocabulary, text complexity, citing evidence from the text, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

creating claims and counter claims.  Additional topics will be developed as they pertain to the relevancy of the curriculum 
requirements and emerging students’ needs.  Focus Group meetings will be held daily during Common Planning Time.  In these 
meetings, both ENL and content area teachers engage in Inquiry work to support students that rank in both the top and 
bottom thirds. Additional congruence and teacher articulation meetings are scheduled throughout the school year to discuss 
SIFE and ELL issues.  Assistant principals and content academic specialists attend regional and national professional 
development conferences in order to turn-key current instructional practices to all school constituents. 
  
For the past two years, we have fully implemented the DOE's Advance system, based on Danielson's Framework for Teachers, 
for further professional development and evaluation of teachers.  As we implement this system, special attention is given to 
teachers who teach ELLs.  Moving forward, we will continue to promote sheltered instructions for all ELL classrooms.  Finally, 
ELL support staff will also participate in professional development programs and SLC seminars scheduled bi-weekly and 
conducted by designated assistant principal and academic specialists and outside vendors. 
  
All teachers in Global Citizens SLC receive 6 period of professional development from the AP ENL each month; the receive an 
additional 6 periods of professional development from Sally Mussafi, Global Citizens' SLC Director.  Professional development 
is focused on best practices for ELLs. 
  
The calendar of Professional Development for all staff who interact with ELLs looks like: 
  
November 3  rd   (Election Day) and June 9  th   (Brooklyn/Queens Day) 
  
For at least one hour each PD day, all staff will be training in Translation and Interpreting services available to parents of 
ELLs.  Participants in these PDs include but are not limited to: All ENL teachers, all content teachers who teach ELLs and F-ELLs, 
all ENL/Bilingual Coordinators, all Assistant Principals, all guidance counselors, all special education teachers who teach ELLs

At Hillcrest, incoming 9  th   Graders are supported in a variety of ways as they transition from middle to high school.  First, 
each August all students attend a required Open House for incoming 9  th   graders where they are given instruction in school 
rules, college readiness, and other important aspects of high school preparation.  On an SLC level, our SLC Director, Ms. 
Ramjan, holds "Town Hall" meetings for all newly arrived students four times a year.   
  
Our counselors meet with each incoming 9  th   grader as they arrive to pick up their programs, and a yearly meeting is held 
with the parents to discuss each students' progress toward graduation.  Programming is taken seriously for our incoming 9  
th   graders.  We wait until NYSESLAT data from the previous spring arrives before we program students for the ENL and 
bilingual classes.

As Guidance Counselors play an integral role in this process, special professional development is given to our ENL and Bilingual 
counselors each year.  Recently, our counselors attended multiple sessions on the requirements of the newly revised CR Part 
154.2.  Our counselors also attend PD offered by the Department of ELLs and Student Support several times a year to learn 
about the socio-emotional needs of our students.  Finally, we utilize Title I funding to provide counselors with additional ways 
to further develop their expertise and practice working with ELLs.  For example, our counselors recently received training on 
how to deal with undocumented and unaccompanied minors from Central America.  The numbers entering our 9  th   grade 
were higher than we had ever seen before, and handling this situation required new training and protocols that our counselors 
quickly became versed in.   
  
Hillcrest High School provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the 
needs of English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all 
teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.  At Hillcrest, for all bilingual and 
English as a New Language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours is 
dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and  
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.    
  
Records from these professional development meetings are kept with AP ENL, Russell Wasden.  A binder of all agendas and 
sign-in sheets is maintained in his office.   Furthermore, digital versions are also stored electronically. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our ENL/Bilingual Coordinator and guidance counselors individually meet with the parents or guardians of our ELLs at least 
once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other 
scheduled meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development 
progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content 
areas.  This additional meeting includes all school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the 
child’s language development in all content areas in English and in the child’s home language in the case of students enrolled 
in a bilingual education program. 
  
Per our Translation and Interpretation Plan, the Language Coordinator, Parent Coordinator, SLC Director, SLC Guidance 
Counselors, and ENL/Bilingual Coordinator all work together to ensure that the linguistic needs of the parents are met on all 
levels.  The school keeps a roster of all bilingual personal in the building to be called upon for translation and interpreting if 
necessary.  In the event that in-house personnel are not available, translation services will be provided by the Translation & 
Interpretation Unit or by an outside vendor. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parents play an integral role in their child's education at Hillcrest.  Twice a year we have SLC activities aimed at getting 
parents into the school to participate in college-ready events and activities such as our monthly ENL Night and Spring Field Day 
and Family Picnic.   
  
The role of our Parent Coordinator is to organize all monthly Parent Association meetings.  ELL parents participate in our 
monthly Parent Association Meetings.  In fact, this year, the president of our PA is from a family of Former ELLs.  PA meetings 
are venues for parents to provide viable input to school administration.  During these meetings, the parent coordinator 
provides parents with questions and comment forms to be filled out and decisions are made by the school's Leadership Team 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

to implement suggestions received from parents including ELL parents.  Through the PA, we offer several classes in ENL, 
technology, and life skills for our ELL parents.   
  
Using translation and interpretation resources, the Parent Coordinator lets parents know about all upcoming meetings and 
events using the home language of the students. 
  
Our annual Parent-Teacher conferences always consist of specific outreach to parents of our ELLs.  Overall, we see a much 
higher percentage of ELL parents participating in these events vis-à-vis the parents of mainstream students.  After receiving 
several orientation sessions upon enrollment of their child, ELL parents are invited to attend additional Orientation Meetings 
and Parent Association Meetings, which often coincide with our regularly schedule Back-to-School nights and Parent-Teacher 
Conferences. These additional orientations are typically used to familiarize parents with state standards, assessments, school 
expectations and general program requirements for bilingual and ESL programs, but they can also include practical education 
for the parents as well.  These sessions included but are not limited to survival ESL, technology, and finances. Written 
invitations to attend Orientation Sessions are always sent to parents at least two weeks prior to the event. Invitations are also 
often given to students in hard copy to take home.   
  
Per our Translation and Interpretation Plan, the Language Coordinator, Parent Coordinator, SLC Director, SLC Guidance 
Counselors, and ENL/Bilingual Coordinator all work together to ensure that the linguistic needs of the parents are met on all 
levels.  The school keeps a roster of all bilingual personal in the building to be called upon for translation and interpreting if 
necessary.  In the event that in-house personnel are not available, translation services will be provided by the Translation & 
Interpretation Unit or by an outside vendor.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Morrison, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To best serve parents and students in our community who speak languages other than English, data is collected 
on an on-going bases from multiple data sources such as ATS. Data are analyzed to determine the needs of our 
parents using the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). Student emergency contact cards are also 
reviewed and filed at least once a year by the ENL/Bilingual Coordinator to determine the language needs of the 
students. In-house surveys are conducted every semester to determine the language needs of the students, 
particularly for testing. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

AP ENL, SLC Director, and ENL/Bilingual Coordinator record all data into one spreadsheet that coincides with 
student programs/schedules and current level of ENL, along with their current grade level and official class. This 
record is shared frequently in hard copy and digital form with school administration, testing coordinators, 
attendance teacher, Guidance Counselor, Dean’s Office, Social Worker, secretaries, and other pertinent personnel 
around the building. 

 

All ENL and content area classroom teachers who support ELLs have on-going methods to procure home language 
information on students. Teachers keep these records along with anecdotal and biographical records in our 
student data center, Skedula, and refer to them as needed throughout the school year. 

After we cull data from the sources mentioned above, we use this data to ensure that all written and oral 
communication with parents is provided in the language that is requested. Using Title I translation and 
interpretation funding, we hire certified pedagogues, secretaries, and other members of our community to be 
present when translation and interpretation is needed. We also train our LAC, Parent Coordinator and others to 
know the languages that are required, and how to best meet the linguistic needs of our diverse population. 
Finally, these frequent communications in the parents’ home languages allow us to set up mandated monthly ENL 
parent night, one-on-one parent meetings, parent teacher conference phone blasts, etc. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

Spanish (42%) 

Bengali (34%) 

 

We currently have two bilingual programs in the school for Spanish and Bengali. Furthermore, Spanish and 
Bengali translation and interpretation are priorities in our school for functions such as Parent Association 
Meetings, where we always have Spanish and Bengali interpreters present for our Spanish and Bengali parents.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency, the school would use in-house personnel to reach out to limited-English-proficient 
families for interpretation purposes. In the event that school personnel are not available to translate for the 
languages needed, the school would reach out to the DOE's translation and interpretation unit for support.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Utilizing a portion of the mandated 15% of all professional development in the school focused on ENL instruction, we 
will inform all staff members in the school community of what resources are available for them when they interact 
with ELLs and their families. 

 

 

Dates of these PDs are: 

 

September 6th, 2017 

November 7th, 2017 (Election Day)

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

As per Section VII of the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663, the school fulfills parent notifications in translation and 
interpretation by providing them with notification of: 

 

Global Citizens, the Small Learning Community (SLC) at Hillcrest High School, also posts many of the documents 
needed by parents in multiple languages in the SLC Office. These documents are either translated by in-house 
personnel or are taken from the Translation and Interpreting Unit of the DOE. Translation and Interpretation 
brochures are also readily available in the office, along with “I Speak …” Welcome cards. 

At Hillcrest we post signs in Spanish, Bengali, Haitian Creole, Urdu, French and Arabic at the main entrance scanning 
area and in front of the main elevator indicating the availability of interpreting services to all parents. We also have 
recorded messages in the above mentioned languages. Our Safety Plan contains procedures for ensuring that parents 
in need of language support receive it. Interpreters are available to ELL parents for all Parent Association Meetings. All 
parents are provided with copies of Parents’ Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. The quarterly School Newsletter is also 
translated on a regular basis, and notifies parents of these and other related services. 

 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school has several on-going mechanisms to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of 
translation and interpretation services. To begin, parents are informed of their rights during the intake process. We 
begin asking for feedback in this interaction. Second, parents are asked to provide feedback on the translation and 
interpretation services of the school during our annual meetings. Guidance counselors, ENL/Bilingual Coordinator, SLC 
Director, Social Worker and Dean’s Office also regularly ask parents for feedback regarding the availability of services 
in their respective areas of the school. Finally, Global Citizens SLC disseminates a comprehensive survey to all parents 
at the end of each school year, asking for ways we can better serve the community regarding their right to availability 
of translation and interpretation services. 

This year we will create a focus group of parents that includes parent representatives from all major languages and 
cultures in the school. This group will meet at least twice to discuss the current ways we are providing services in the 
school, and give us feedback on how to make these services better.
