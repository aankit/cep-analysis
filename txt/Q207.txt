Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our mission statement is as follows: The school community at PS/MS 207 will provide a safe, educational environment 
that supports, guides, and encourages students to develop freedom of expression, respect for others, and a love of 
learning. We are forever “In Pursuit of Excellence.” We feel our mission statement reflects our school community’s 
supportive environment and the way in which we engage all students so they will be college and career ready. 

 

At PS/MS 207Q, it is our goal to create a community of learners among our staff members. We believe that it is 
essential for all staff members to work collaboratively, share knowledge and resources, analyze data, and plan 
together in order to refine lessons and teaching approaches so that all learners experience success and meet 
standards. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our Pre K to grade eight school supports 679 students. In September 2018 we will add two three-K classes. Over 
twenty percent of our population have IEPs. We have five ENL students, two in grade two, one in grade four, one in 
grade seven, and one in grade eight. We have two former ELLs, on who achieved commanding on the Spring 2016 
NYSESLAT and one who is new to our school. One of our former ELLs will graduate in June. The other will continue to 
receive 90 minutes of support. All other ENL students will be provided with the appropriate number of minutes 
according to the results of the 2018 NYSESLAT. 

 

The Teaching and Learning Cycle (Assess, Evaluate, Plan, and Teach) is at the center of our vision for school 
improvement. We regularly evaluate assessment data in order to plan focused instruction for the variety of learners in 
our school building. It is our belief that targeted instruction based on the needs of learners will lead to increased 
achievement. This philosophy applies to developing our teachers as well as the students in our school. 

 

The administrative team continuously communicates the high expectations they have set to the staff. Our formative 
feedback sessions following classroom observations focus on the Danielson Rubric. By designing our feedback 
sessions around examination of the rubric, the high expectations that are inherent within the framework are clearly 
explained to each teacher. Next steps for each teacher are designed using the language of the rubric. Teacher goal 
setting is also focused on the high expectations of the Danielson Rubric. Teachers evaluate the rubric and set 
professional learning goals around specific components of the Framework. 

 

PS/MS 207Q is one of the few district 27 schools to contain the ASD NEST program. The ASD NEST program is an 
inclusive education model servicing high functioning children with Autism Spectrum disorders alongside regular 
education students. The purpose of this program is to support high functioning students with Autism Spectrum 
disorders in their social and emotional development. Each NEST classroom has two co-teachers, one general 
education teacher and one special education teacher, who have completed initial NEST training as well as participate 
in weekly NEST meetings and on-going professional learning throughout the year. During the 2018-2019 school year 
we will have six nest classes in grades K-5 with one nest class in each grade. 

Most of our classes follow the collaborative teaching model. This affords general and special education students the 
opportunity for a lower student to teacher ratio while experiencing the benefit of a special education teacher who 
adapts curriculum to meet the needs of all students. This year we have a regents class in grade 8. Students will

participate in the CC Algebra I and Living Environment curriculum. In June 2018 all students who took the Algebra 
regent and the Living Environment regent passed. 

Two programs will be employed in 2018-2019 to meet the needs of all learners including students with disabilities, 
ELLs, and gifted students. Teachers College Reading and Writing Project will engage all students in the writing process 
and foster a love of reading, writing, and making personal connections. The Wilson Reading Program will provide 
intense support for Tier 3 students in grades 6-8. This year seven grade 8 students will participate in intensive ELA and 
Mathematics instruction. Although these students are in an Inclusion class for all other subjects, they will be in a self-
contained (12:1) section for both ELA and Math. Fundations, which is part of the Wilson program, will be used with 
Tier 3 students in grades K-2. In grades five and six, students will participate in the Algebra for All program. Teachers 
have had extensive professional development in the implementation of this program.  

 

Our goals reflect the need to plan for higher order learning opportunities in order to engage all students. We are 
constantly reflecting and discussing with teachers how we can increase the level of thinking and opportunity for high 
student engagement for all learners. 

 

Our cross curricular efforts include K-8 Fine Arts instruction aligned to the Social Studies Scope and Sequence. During 
teacher teams, our fine arts department including the art, technology, and music teachers plan units and projects to 
connect to classroom learning opportunities. 

 

Our students are involved in many activities that help to foster lifelong learning and citizenship. We collaborate with 
the Kiwanis club which enables our students to learn community awareness and involvement. They help those less 
fortunate than they and support those in need. Through Kiwanis there are a number of events that foster our student 
involvement in their community. Grade 4 and 5 students are involved in a fitness program called BOKS (Building Our 
Kids Success) sponsored and funded by Reebok. Students participate in tournaments during the school day in 
volleyball and basketball. After games the athletes eat lunch together. It gives them an opportunity to meet students 
from other schools in neighboring communities. Middle school students are involved in CHAMPS which is designed to 
motivate students to be active and healthy. They participate in Flag Football and Volleyball. They practice after school 
and participate in weekend tournaments. This year our students have the opportunity to attend an after-school 
program, SASF (Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation) which is an after-school program. A drama club is an integral 
part of the program. 

 

During the 2017/18 school year, many middle school students participated in the New York City Department of 
Education Shubert Foundation Musical Theatre International, Arts Connections, and iTheatrics. This endeavor 
culminated in a performance of Seussical Jr. the Musical. This is a three-year partnership that will afford many 
students to collaborate in various aspects of the arts.  

 

We share a partnership with St. Joseph’s College. They send us student teachers who work with one upper grade class 
and one lower grade class. They also work with special education and general education students. Teachers serve as 
mentors by sharing best practices with them. In addition we have a partnership between the Physical Education

general and special education students in the area of Physical Education.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students with special needs make up over 20% of the population at PS/MS 207Q. We are also one of only two schools 
in District 27 to house the ASD Nest Program, and the only District 27 school to house the program on an elementary 
school level. PS/MS 207 currently has 16 ICT classes, 6 of which are ASD Nest classes. .The ASD Nest Program is a 
partnership between the NYCDOE and New York University’s (NYU) ASD Nest Support Project. This program serves 
students with ASD and typically developing students in a reduced class-size Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) model. There 
are two teachers (one special education teacher and one general education teacher) in each class. Class structure: 
class size and ratio in the ASD Nest Program varies by grade. As students get older, the class size increases as does the 
ratio of students with ASD to typically developing students. School-based staff: receive training in specialized teaching 
strategies for students with ASD, including Social Development Intervention (SDI) developed by NYU. SDI is an 
evidence-based program that supports social/emotional development of ASD Nest students. Curriculum and 
instruction: as in all NYCDOE schools, ASD Nest Program classes use the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). ASD 
Nest Program classes combine CCLS and SDI to improve social understanding while also supporting academic success. 
SDI is taught in small groups and reinforced throughout the day. Social/emotional supports: related service providers 
use SDI to help children develop relationships and social functioning. This pragmatic (social) language curriculum is 
taught in small groups of ASD Nest students and reinforced by classroom teachers. 

 

In September 2018, there will be two self-contained special education classes. One of the programs that are used 
during 12:1 ELA periods is the Wilson Reading System. This is a structured literacy program based on phonological-
coding research and Orton Gillingham principles, WRS directly and systematically teaches the structure of the English 
language. Through the program, students learn fluent decoding and encoding skills to the level of mastery. Students 
receive instruction in phonemic awareness, decoding and word study, sight word recognition, spelling, fluency, 
vocabulary, oral expressive language development, and comprehension.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We have made progress in the areas of instruction, strong-family and community ties, and trust. We have shifted our 
instructional focus in the 2018/19 CEP to ELA because all students from K-5 and ELA teachers in grades 6-8 will 
participate in Teachers' College Reading and Writing. We will continue to strive for excellence in both ELA and Math. 
For the next year, we will strengthen these areas by reaching out to parents to create a collaboration that improves 
learning outcomes for all students. This school year we will also focus on sharing best practices and encouraging 
teachers to improve their craft through the professional development provided by Teachers' College and by attending 
outside professional development. This year teachers will turnkey and provide professional development for 
colleagues.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We conducted research on the last 5 years of data from the NYS ELA Exam. We examined our current students by 
tracking the percentage of students achieving 3s and 4s combined and students achieving 2s as they moved through 
grades in our school.  

Our current 8th grade has a mean of 45.7% of students achieving 3s and 4s combined during the 5 year time period 
with a range of 11.4% points. Students achieving Level 2 have a mean of 43.7 with a range of 7.1%. Levels 3 and 4 
combined showed the highest avers of 56.8% in Spring 2017. However, in grades four and five, level threes and fours 
combined were at their lowest percentages. Level twos remain relatively steady at 37.7% in grade three, 46.2% in 
grade four, 46.8% in grade five, and 49.4% in grade 6. Although there was a slight decrease in level threes and fours in 
grade 7, this trend needs to be supported so that our students will continue to improve. 

Our current 7th grade demonstrates an area of concern and focus. Over four years of the NYS ELA Exam, the current 
7th grade has a mean of 34.7%, significantly lower than all other testing grades in PS/MS 207. In Spring 2017, levels 
three and four combined were 26.3%. There was an increase of levels twos from 2016 to 2017 of 17.9% from 31.3% to 
49.2%. Level ones remain extremely high at 24.5% on the Spring 2017 exam. In grade three the level ones were 
24.6%, grade four 14.1%, grade five 29.7%, and grade 6 24.5%. These students are in need of intensive support to 
develop strategies to improve their ELA skills.  

Our current 6th grade has a mean of 45.8% achieving level three and four combined. There was an increase in level 
twos from 34.3% in grade three to 39.1% in grade 5. Students achieving level one were 31.4 in grade three, 31.0% in 
grade four, and 39.1% in grade 5. This increase indicates these students are in need of additional support. 

Our current 5th grade has a mean of 48.0% of students achieving levels three and four combined in grades three an 
four. The number of students achieving level 2 also remained steady with a slight decrease from 2016 to 2017 of 0.2% 
from 38.1% to 37.9%. Level ones also remained relatively steady from 14.3% in 2016 to 13.6% in 2017.  

Our current 4th has one year of state testing. They scored 10.3% at level four, 42.6% at level three, 32.4% at level two, 
and 14.7% at level one.  

We also analyzed the growth percentiles of our students with disabilities. Growth percentile tracks the progress of 
students against students throughout the city who have scored the same on prior state tests and have certain 
educational/social factors in common (IEPs, socioeconomic status, race) This is a major of a focus in our action plan 
and will be addressed by a benchmarking process using Fountas and Pinnell.

The ELA Vertical Teacher Team examined data from the 2017 Items Skills Analysis report. There were several 
strengths and weaknesses that were recognized. On the short response questions, the students did not cite enough 
textual evidence. Across the grades, students demonstrated weaknesses in reading informational texts. They 
consistently needed to cite additional textual evidence. In addition, in grades six through eight, students were 
deficient in using context clues to gain meaning and in recognizing the central idea of a text.  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a mean increase of three levels in students' Fountas and Pinnell scores in grades K - 8 as 
measured by the BOY and EOY Fountas and Pinnell benchmark assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Attendance and tardiness are a problem throughout the student population. Attendance data on the most recent RYIS 
ATS report was analyzed for attendance trends. Five hundred, eighty-eight students (86.9%) have an attendance rate 
between 90% and 99%. Attendance rates for the majority of students falls just above or just below 95%. Attendance 
rates for sixty-seven students (9.9%) falls between 80%-89% and one percent (7 students) fall in the 70% - 79% range. 
The RCUL report was examined for lateness data. Lateness is especially apparent in grades 6-8 where many students 
travel to school by themselves. There are at least 60 students who have been late more than 10 times. Many of those 
students were actually late 25 days or more. Punctuality and good attendance are life-long traits that are useful in our 
career and college-ready environment. It is necessary for students to develop this habit to successfully function in 
many real-world situations. We will strive to decrease the lateness rate and increase the attendance rate throughout 
the school. We strive to support the whole child by maintaining parent contact, providing at-risk guidance when 
needed, and providing clear expectations in all classrooms throughout the school. We feel that attendance greatly 
impacts student performance. Performance data that was analyzed by teacher teams shows that students who were 
late consistently struggled in their first period classes and had difficulty completing assignments on time. Teacher 
recommendations were to contact parents and provide incentives for these students to promote increased 
achievement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2018, there will be a five percent decrease in lateness and a ten percent increase in attendance as measured 
by ATS aggregate attendance reports (RCUL and RRSA).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Communication is critical in the academic environment. Teachers must share their expertise, best practices, and 
concerns in order to facilitate successful learning outcomes. Many teachers have a great deal of experience and 
know-how to share with their colleagues. Coaching will enable teachers to learn from each other and to share their 
ideas, best practices, and concerns. In a school setting, there isn’t a great deal of time to meet and share. Professional 
development outside the school enables teachers to turn-key their findings to their grade or subject colleagues. Data 
is examined and shared during vertical team meetings and grade conferences. After communication logs and coaching 
logs are examined, ways to improve communication are discussed. Suggestions from the Quality Review in October 
2017 were examined. The reviewer stressed several questions concerning communication. What are schoolwide 
systems for communicating goals and monitoring progress? How are shared expectations across the school 
communicated to students, staff, and families? Clear and consistent communication is instrumental in creating a 
learning environment that enables all students to reach their full potential. Although the QR described the school 
culture as well developed and an area of celebration, the Quality Snapshot indicated that 89% responded positively to 
questions about Collaborative Teachers." This is slightly above the city and district average, however, it indicates 
there is room for growth and improvement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a ten percent increase in the number of teachers who engage in coaching activities (from 3% 
to approximately 15%) and feedback sessions with colleagues as measured by coaching logs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2016-17 School Quality Guide was examined to identify areas of need concerning effective school leadership. Last 
year our score dropped from 3.52 to 3.16 and then it increased to 3.49 this year. In the survey, 78% of teachers 
responded that many or all of the teachers in their school are eager to try new ideas. We feel that we should take 
advantage of their willingness to learn by having teachers share their expertise with each other. In addition, according 
to the survey, teachers did not feel that they had a great deal of influence over selecting instructional materials to be 
used in the classroom (59%) or developing instructional materials (73%). We believe that teachers should share and 
take ownership of materials and strategies to be used in classrooms. There is a need for continued support of this 
teacher pedagogy by effective leadership. This is developed from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn 
best that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching. Engaging instruction, aligned 
to the curricula, that meets the needs of all learners including SWDs and ELLs is essential. We feel that all staff 
members must take an active role in supporting each other in developing strong teacher pedagogy and creating 
effective, engaging instruction. We want to encourage all teachers to share their expertise with others.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the principal and assistant principal will attend a minimum of ten Teachers College Professional 
Development days and conference with teachers to ensure successful implementation of the program in reading and 
writing as measured by a 4% increase in component 3D of the Danielson Framework for Teaching.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

We believe that one way of creating a school climate where all parents and guardians feel welcome, informed, and 
included in the school community is by increasing attendance at PTA meetings. At PTA meetings parents are informed 
of upcoming events in the school, issues that impact their children's education, and ways in which they can become 
more involved. Often there are discussions in which parents can voice their opinions and concerns. These are the 
ways in which strong family-community ties are fostered and trust becomes an integral component of the school 
culture. In addition, this creates school community relationships that have a strong foundation based on trust and 
respect. It helps parents to develop ways to support their children's learning. The school Quality Snapshot was 
examined to determine how parents responded to questions concerning these issues. Ninety-three percent of parents 
responded positively to questions about trust. This is three percentage points below the city average and four 
percentage points below the district average. In addition, ninety-five percent responded positively to questions 
concerning strong family-community ties. This is consistent with the city average (94%) and the district average (95%). 
We feel that with diligence we can improve these responses and we can strengthen our relationships. We feel 
strongly that attendance at PTA meetings helps to create a strong foundation and fosters connections between all 
members of the school community. Two years ago our PA voted to go back to our school organization being a PTA. 
The teachers were also in favor of creating this connection. We feel that this has strengthened our school-home 
relationship.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a five percent increase in attendance at PTA meetings as measured by monthly PTA 
attendance sheets.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Paste response to questions here: PS/MS 207 uses Fountas and Pinnell to benchmark  literacy skills  3 times each year (BOY, 
MOY, EOY).  In addition, progress monitoring using Fountas and Pinnell is provided periodically to each student depending on 
their proficiency level.  Teachers also use teacher-created and rubric-based assessments to monitor progress and provide next 
steps for instruction. Remediation or enrichment is provided for each student according to need.  At this time, we have no 
quantitative data. There are two ELL students in grade one.  One of those students was held over in Sept. 2017.  One students 
entered our school in January from One grade 7 student entered our school in September from Greece.  There is one grade 6 
ELL student who entered our school last year. We have two former ELL students; one grade 8 student entered our school in 
Sept. and one grade 7 student gained proficiency in Spring 2017. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

We have one RTI teacher who services the early grades.  All students are served as needed.  Groups are fluid according to 
student response to remediation.  All middle school students in need of remediation will be served in small groups with 
differentiated instruction and appropriate materials.  The two proficient former ELLs are receive support two times each week 
(90 minutes). 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here:   We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs in several ways.  Firstly, we examine how 
middle school students’ achievement in subject areas on unit tests, projects, homework, and Periodic Assessments.  We 
determine strengths and weaknesses and the areas in which additional support is needed.  Then we examine the NYS exam 
scores and the item analysis to determine areas of weakness.  In grades 3-5, we examine Periodic Assessments, class work, and 
teacher observation to determine how well ELLs are doing and how successful instruction is.  In grades K-2, we rely on Fountas 
and Pinnell benchmarking and teacher observation to determine how well instruction is meeting their needs.  Ultimately, we 
examine NYSESLAT scores to determine progress in language acquistion.  Last year, our grade 5 ELL (now grade 6) scored at the 
Expanding for which he will receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction in ENL/ELA plus additional instruction during 
math.  He is included in the ICT group for which the special education teacher provides targeted, small-group instruction. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We will review all formative and summative assessment data.  All students will receive necessary support for areas of 
weakness. Teachers teams review data for all students and develop support as needed.  All teachers who support ELL students 
work with teacher teams for their designated grades. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:  In addition to NYS assessment data and NYSESLAT results, teacher-made exams and teacher 
observation play an important role in guiding the appropriate ENL instruction.  For our ENL students, who are at-risk 
academically, intervention is now provided at the Tier I level by a special education teacher.  Interventions will escalate to a 
Tier II level data from classroom assessments indicate that further intervention is needed.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Paste response to question here:  In September 2017, two students were given  NYSITELL. Mateo Garcia-Acosta and Fiona 
Neco scored at the expanding level and are receiving 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.   We have 1 ENL student who 
has passed the the NYSELAT.  Justin Nitschinger entered the NYC school system in December 2013.  He achieved proficiency 
status in Spring 2017.  Justin will be given 90 minutes of ESL support during the 2017/18 school year.  Our students who took 
the NYSESLAT in Spring 2017 are receiving ENL services by certified teachers.  Zhen Xi Chen scored at the transitioning level 
and Utsho Rozario scored at the expanding level. Fiona Neco and Alicia Jara were given the NYSITELL upon entering the 
NYC school system.  Both are receiving four periods of ENL instruction each week. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have a small ELL population - 5 ELLs and two former ELLs.  We are able to continuously monitor their status and make 
adjustments accordingly.  The sixth and seventh grade student are monitored by the subject area teachers along with their ENL 
teachers.  The 2 first grade students are service together by an ENL teacher and are monitored by her and their classroom 
teachers.  Both form er ELL students are currently in Inclusion classes and are monitored by the general and special education 
teachers.  They are included in small-group differentiated instruction whenever possible.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Paste response to questions here:  We have a Freestanding ENL program.  When we have ENLs in the early grades, we 
employ a pull-out program to enable students to acquire language skills necessary to communicate and assimilate 
successfully in the classroom setting.  Our grade 6 and 7 ENL students are in an ICT classes which travel as a group.  It 
is a heterogeneous class in which there are general education students and student's with disabilities.   The Integrated 
ENL program is the push-in model which is used.  Utsho and Fiona  are supported in ELA, Math, Science, and Social 
Studies by an ESL teacher and a subject-area teacher.  This enables them to delelop content-area skills while the 
teacher aligns ENL instruction with classroom assignments. Justin and Alejandro are former ELL students who are in 
grades 7 and 8 respectively. They receive two additional years of support.  This is 90 minutes per week to enable them 
to  maintain progress. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:   N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:  N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Paste response to questions here:   Every September the LAC examines NYSESLAT data to determine how many minutes 
of instruction each ENL needs.  When there are new ENL students, the NYSITELL enables the LAC to determine how many 
minutes of instruction is needed for each student.  ENL and ELA instruction are delivered in each class.  Small-group, targeted 
instruction is provided in ELA and ENL.  HLA  is provided through stong family ties.  HLA is accomplished through 
communication with his parents. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Paste response here:   Core content is delivered by the content-area provider using the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  The special ed teacher and ENL teacher provide small-group targeted instruction based on the instructional needs 
of the students, teacher observation, and conferencing. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Paste response to question here:  Throughout the year, both ELL students will receive brief, take-home assignments to 
complete.  This will involve his parent in his education.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:  SIFE students are dealt with on an individual basis.  Depending on their ELL status upon 
their return to school, they are instructed accordingly.  For new ENL students instruction is explicit and helps them to acquire 
language skills necessary to assimilate into the classroom setting and meet the demands of the Common Core curriculum.  This 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

is accomplished using a pull-out model where the teacher can concentrate on language acquisition.  Developing and long-term 
ELLs are instructed using a push-in model to assist students in subject-area classes where greater responsibility is transferred 
to the student.  For ELLs are given support in subject-area classes to continue to increase their language skills and promote 
more independence for the student.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:  All ELLs are provided with the instructional strategies and grade-level materials to meet their 
individual needs as determined by standardized tests, classroom assessments, and teacher evaluation.  All ELL students are 
provided with rigorous instruction, which is adjusted according to their needs and their IEP requirements.  Progress is 
frequently monitored and revised to encourage and accelerate English language development.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here:  At this time , we have 2 ENL students.  This unique situation affords us the ability to provide 
the least restrictive environment for that student.  In addition, we are able to provide a schedule and instructional materials 
that support his academic needs and language development.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here:   All intervention services are offered in English.  Intervention services range from RTI Tier 1 
and Tier 2.   . 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here:  At this time, there are no new programs being considered.  With 1 ENL student we feel we 
are able to meet his individual needs.  Utsho is supported by an ESL teacher four times each week in the subject areas.  The 
support includes ongoing support for Math, ELA, and writing.  Zhen Xi is supported 8 periods a week in acquiring language skills 
and in reading and math. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:   N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here:   All programs are available to our ENL students as well as SWDs.  There is an after-school 
SASF program which is available to all students.  In addition, lunch time programs are available in Robotics, Band, Chorus, and 
Art for middle school students..  Depending on Utsho's  preferences, all programs will be available to him as he enters grade 6 
in September.  Basketball ball and volleyball teams are available to middle school students.  Students must try out for those. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Paste response to question here:  Both ELL students receive instruction in the Common Core ELA curriculum and Go Math.  In 
September, Utsho will be given a ipad to assist him in his classes.  Technology is scheduled 2 times a week.  Although ENL 
students are instructed with the same materials as all students, the ENL teacher uses additional materials to assist new ENLs in 
acquiring language skills necessary to communicate and assimilate into classroom setting.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here:  In our ENL program, home language support is provided by translations when needed 
through staff members. Currently, most ELL students' families speak English and do not require aditional services.  One parent 
speaks Spanish and a staff member translates for her when needed. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Paste response to question here:   All support and resources are aligned with students' grade levels and ages.  Services, such 
as, counseling and AIS are grade and age appropriate in both materials and delivery.  Services are provided according to need 
which is determined by teacher observation, formative and summative data. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here:   N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here:   The SASF recreational program is available for all students.  Parents register their children at 
the beginning of the summer. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Paste response to question here:  All grade 8 students are scheduled for 3 periods of Spanish per week.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:   N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:   The certified ESL teachers can take advantage of the PD offered by the district. At the 
present time, each ESL teacher instructs one ELL student.  One teaches grade 2 and the other teaches grade 6 math.  Both 
teachers participate in many PD activities.  All professional development activities are designed to enable teachers to improve 
their pedagody.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Paste response to question here:  Common preps and planning time is given to staff to meet the needs of the ELL students as 
they move from the elementary grades to the middle school grades.  In the elementary grades, teachers meet on the grade to 
plan and provide differentiated instruction for all students.  In the middle school, teachers meet in both subject area and grade 
level to provide appropriate instruction for all students.    
Paste response to question here:   All teachers are instructed in ways to work with the ESL teacher to provide optimal 
instruction for all ELL students.  Teachers receive a minimum of 7.5 hours of training to align classroom instruction with ESL 
instruction to enable ELL students to receive differentiated instruction to meet their specific academic needs.  The ESL teacher 
and/or administration will provide professional development.  Guest presenters will provide support whenever possible.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:  When letters are sent to inform parents of continued services, parents are invited to an 
individual meeting to discuss their child.  Translation will be provided as needed.  Either a staff member, the Translation Unit, 
or an outside vendor will be used as needed.  The meeting will be attended by the ESL teacher, the LAC, and the Parent 
Coordinator.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Paste response here:  ELL parents are invited to be involved in all activities.  There are PTA meetings, parents who volunteer in 
classrooms in a program called Parents Supporting Instruction (PSI), and chaperones for trips.  ELL parents are invited to all 
class activities and celebrations.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Eileen Davies, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

ESL data is examined to determine which languages are needed for written and oral interpretation. At the time of 
registration, we have the parent fill out the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). We conduct an oral 
interview if necessary. We also look at the RCPL report on ATS. At the present time, all written communication is 
done in English. At least one or both parents of each child can read English. A few parents need oral conversations 
to be translated in Spanish. This is accomplished through the use of a Spanish-speaking teacher or 
paraprofessional. Two parents need an American Sign-Language interpreter. We request one from the office of 
Translation and Interpretation. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

There are no languages, other than English, that represent a 10% population 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

procedures to

translated 

documents to 

parents.  

At the present 
time, all students 
have at least one 
parent who 
speaks and/or 
reads English. 
We 
accommodate 
the other parent 
by translating 
letters using a 
staff member. 
Each year when 
the languages 
needed are 
determined, we 
make sure 
procedures are 
in place to 
communicate 
with each parent 
effectively and in 
a timely fashion. 
When necessary, 
an outside 
vendor will be 
used to provide 
translation. 
More often, 
translation can 
be accomplished 
through the use 
of a teacher, 
paraprofessional, 
or parent 
volunteer. We 
also make 
parents aware 
that the DOE 
website is 
equipped to 
provide 
information in

many languages. 
The DOE website 
is extremely 
accommodating 
to their needs. 
Also, many 
notices are 
automatically 
printed out in 
their preferred 
languages.  

 

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to provide 

interpretation service(s)?  

Formal face-to-face meetings 
typically include parent-teacher 
conferences, Meet-the-Teacher 
night, High School Night (Grade 7-8), 
IEP conferences when needed, and 
Parent Communication (Tues. 
afternoon). Informal interactions 
may include calls to parents by the 
teacher or guidance counselor or sick 
calls by nurse. For the formal 
meetings, we are always prepared in 
advance if a staff member is needed 
to translate. If necessary an outside 
interpreter is called. For impromptu 
calls, we use a staff member when 
necessary. At the present time, we 
are able to comply with all 
interpretation needs. However, if an 
interpreter is needed for a call, we 
will use the Translation & 
Interpretation Unit to fulfill the 
parents' needs.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In an emergency, a faculty member or another parent will communicate with limited-English proficient families. In 
addition to the use of a staff member, we will use the Phone Interpretation Service or the Language and 
Interpretation Unit.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In September, the first day is used to inform teachers of all compliance regulations. Throughout the school year, we 
inform staff members of updated needs that may develop. We check monthly to determine if any additional steps are 
necessary to ensure we continue to be in compliance. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The Welcome Poster is placed in a prominent place in the lobby. The Parents' Bill of Rights and Parents' Guide to 
Language will be sent to all appropriate parents. The Language ID Guide is placed at the security desk and the main 
office. To fulfill the requirements of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 all parents with interpretation needs will receive 
written and verbal communication in a timely manner to enable all parents to participate in their child's education. 
We will also enable all parents to participate in all activities with comfort and ease. The parent coordinator is aware of 
the limited English speaking parents. She provides additional support to include them in all activities and meetings. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

Since we have a limited number of parents in need of interpretation services, we reach out to them individually to 
determine if their needs are being met. This is done in several ways through the administrators, parent coordinator, 
and teachers. The Parent Coordinator arranges to have an interpreter attend attend all meetings.
