Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to provide academic excellence for all students and to create a positive learning environment that is 
supportive, safe, and motivating where individual differences and respect for others guide behavior. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 105, The Blythebourne School is an elementary school with approximately 1,598 students from kindergarten 
through grade 5. The school population comprises .35% Black, 5% Hispanic, 3% White, and 92% Asian students. The 
student body includes 45% English language learners (ELLs) and 6% students with disabilities (SWD). The average 
attendance rate for the school year 2017 - 2018 was 98.1%. Our School Leadership Team meets monthly. We have 
strong parent involvement as evidenced by attendance at our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meetings which 
averages 300 parents. 

We are located in a diverse Brooklyn community inhabited by a large population of Chinese immigrants. Our school 
consists of predominantly English Language Learners (ELLs) with a constant influx of Chinese immigrants. To support 
the learning of these new immigrants, we have Transitional Bilingual Education (Chinese) and English as a New 
Language programs on every grade. Notices, correspondences, letters, as well as report cards are translated in 
Chinese to encourage parental involvement and understanding of their children's progress in school.  

We believe all students can learn, achieve, and meet high standards of excellence regardless of their learning needs. 
The school community and the home work together to reach these high standards of excellence. The school is 
responsible for and committed to engaging all students in active and productive activities, no matter their learning 
needs. The school community and home also come together to promote understanding, tolerance, and respect for 
cultural diversities.  

We have the following partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations (CBOs): PTA Parent 
Volunteers, Brooklyn Chinese –American Association (BCA), Chinese-American Planning Council (CPC), Ming Yuan 
Youth Program, Relay For Life, New York Historical Society, Brooklyn Historical Society, Brooklyn Jewish Museum, 
Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Dance Education, Ballet Tech, Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, City Harvest, Charles B. Wang 
Community Health Center, Maimonides Medical Center - Community Mental Health Center, Center For Family Life, 
Italian Board of Guardians, Inc., Optimum Psychological Services, Inc., The Arab American Family Support Center, and 
Lutheran Family Health Centers-Mental Health Outpatient Services. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

“Students with Disabilities” identified with IEPs comprise approximately 6% of the population at PS 105K. Within that 
population are students with speech delays; learning deficits; social and emotional issues; hearing loss; and students 
identified with autism. 

To the extent possible, students are provided with instruction in “inclusive” settings with their general education 
peers to better access the general education curriculum with all modifications and accommodations necessary to 
better assist them both in and out of the classroom setting. Related services are provided to students in the areas of 
speech, counseling, occupational therapy, physical therapy and hearing services as needed. Supports are provided 
with crisis paraprofessionals, health paraprofessionals and alternate placement paraprofessionals where needed as 
specified on students’ IEPs (Individualized Education Plans). Differentiation of instruction based on student learning 
styles, strengths and weaknesses is provided and all teachers are instructed in the use of various modes of teaching to 
better assist students in acquiring grade level skills. 

Professional development is provided to all teachers and paraprofessionals on strategies and best practices regarding 
the students in their classes with disabilities. 

A small part of the population is identified as students who will be assessed with the NYS Alternate Assessment in a 
variety of subjects. Those students identified are provided with alternate instruction in the subjects indicated on their 
IEPs.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Despite the educational challenges associated with the constant influx of Chinese immigrants admitted to our school 
on a daily basis, the schools supportive structure ensures our ELLs make significant academic progress. Last academic 
year, Spring 2018, 30.1% of ELLs achieved proficiency on the NYSESLAT. 

Key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year include: 

  English language acquisition (A language objective is to be included in every lesson): emphasizing speaking 

and listening for critical conversation 

  Phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding skills to be included in daily instruction 
  Vocabulary - domain specific and tier 2 words to be included in every lesson 
  Writing (craft, author’s purpose, skills, genres) 
  Comprehension (making meaning in all content areas) 
  Math problem solving 
  Differentiation, and small group instruction  
  Personal and academic behaviors will continue to be taught and implemented 
  Targeting needs of students with disabilities to maximize their progress and performance 
  Promote critical thinking, problem solving and creativity through STEM and STEAM activities/projects

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. Our school provides a rigorous curriculum where instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the 
Common Core and is implemented in all classrooms – including English as a New Language (ENL), Transitional Bilingual 
Education (TBE) and Special Education. Teacher teams collaborate and analyze student work to align the Common 
Core Learning Standards and/or content standards and instructional shifts to inform their instruction. Teachers 
collaborate to create and scaffold lessons in units with appropriately challenging tasks that are rigorous. Teachers 
implement and develop collaboratively grade level UDL (Universal Design for Learning) units that reflect the major 
work of the grade. As shown on the 2017-18 School Quality Guide-Framework Element Scores, we received a score of 
3.70 for Rigorous Instruction.  

According to the New York State Report - 2017-2018, our school's proficiency rates are 52.9% for ELA, 82% for Math 
and 97.5% for Science. For the NYSESLAT, we have 30.1% who tested out. Proficiency rates for the ELL subgroup 
(2017-2018): 13.2% for ELA, 67.3% for Math and 92.5% for Science. Proficiency rates for the Students with Disabilities 
subgroup (2017-2018): 10.6% for ELA, 40.4% for Math and 73.3% for Science. 

Our attendance rate is 98.1%. The trends for this school is progress in ELA, Math and Science. ELA - in 2018, percent at 
Level 3 or 4 went up by 3.1%; Math - in 2018, percent at Level 3 or 4 went up by 2.7%; and Science - in 2018, percent 
at level 3 or 4 went up by .2%. 

According to the latest Quality Review (2015-2016), our school received: Proficient for 1.2 Pedagogy, Well Developed 
for 1.1 Curriculum, Proficient for 2.2 Assessment, Well Developed for 3.4 High Expectations, and Well Developed for 
4.2 Teacher Teams and leadership development.  

2. The school’s instructional focus is literacy – the acquisition and proficiency in speaking, listening, reading and 
writing of English for all students. We will continue to promote higher order thinking skills by providing professional 
development and coaching for teachers in questions and discussion techniques and high-level thinking and discourse. 
According to the Advance Teacher Evaluation System, out of 308 observations conducted for 2017-18, for Domain 1e 
(Designing coherent instruction) - 93.8% were rated effective or highly effective and for Domain 3c (Engaging students 
in learning) - 92.2% were rated effective or highly effective.  

The priority needs that will be addressed for this Framework element is to continue to: 

  Provide a rich learning experience for all students, including students with disabilities, English language 

learners, and advanced students 

  Constantly enhance our curriculum to make it challenging and engaging 
  Build academic knowledge aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards

  Encourage students to build on each other’s ideas during class discussions 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Rigorous Instruction  

By June 2019, teachers will design and implement lessons aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards and 
integrate project-based learning opportunities that includes scaffolds and supports for all students; including students 
with disabilities, English language learners, and advanced students as measured by 90% of teachers receiving Effective 
or Highly Effective on the two Advance components: 1e (Designing coherent instruction) and 3c (Engaging students in 
learning).

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, the school will monitor teacher observations, component 1e (Designing coherent instruction) and 
3c (Engaging students in learning) to determine if the school is on a course to meet the annual goal. The mid-point 
benchmark that will indicate school progress towards meeting this goal is receiving over 85% of observations rated 
effective or highly effective on the components 1e and 3c.  

In addition, the school will also analyze middle of the year F&P levels to determine whether students are meeting the 
Teachers College benchmark levels and assessments (quizzes, mid unit assessments, end of unit assessments) entered 
on IO Classroom (Skedula system). 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
We will use the observation results on the Advance Teacher Evaluation System, F&P levels middle of the year and IO 
Classroom (Skedula) – Assessments (quizzes, mid unit assessments, end of unit assessments) to assess progress for 
this goal.  

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Collaboration by analyzing student work for strengths and weaknesses, researching potential strategies and 
tailoring instruction for all students are our school’s strengths. Every teacher is a member of a Teacher Team where 
they undertake an inquiry problem which looks at student work. We schedule collaboration periods for mentor and 
mentees, all teachers within the grade, teacher facilitators/instructional lead teachers, GLOBE teachers, special 
education teachers and technology teachers on a weekly basis. 

As shown on the 2017-18 School Quality Guide-Framework Element Scores, we received a score of 3.95 for 
Collaborative Teachers. In addition, according to the Principal Performance Review – 2017-2018, the principal 
received a score of 97 out of 100 on the Principal Practice Score based on supervisory visits and a rating of 3.88 
(Highly Effective) on Measures of Leadership Practice. 

According to the New York State Report - 2017-2018, our school's proficiency rates are 52.9% for ELA, 82% for Math 
and 97.5% for Science. For the NYSESLAT, we have 30.1% who tested out. Proficiency rates for the ELL subgroup 
(2017-2018): 13.2% for ELA, 67.3% for Math and 92.5% for Science. Proficiency rates for the Students with Disabilities 
subgroup (2017-2018): 10.6% for ELA, 40.4% for Math and 73.3% for Science.  

Our attendance rate is 98.1%. The trends for this school is progress in ELA, Math and Science. ELA - in 2018, percent at 
Level 3 or 4 went up by 3.1%; Math - in 2018, percent at Level 3 or 4 went up by 2.7%; and Science - in 2018, percent 
at level 3 or 4 went up by .2%.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By the end of February 2019, the administrators will monitor the progress of this goal by looking at student 
assessments (Quizzes, Mid-Unit assessments, End of Unit assessments and F&P reading levels). In addition, the 
administrators will analyze the midyear Advance observations results for the Danielson component 4e (Growing and 
developing professionally). 

The mid-point benchmarks that will be used in February 2019 to measure the school’s progress toward meeting this 
annual goal are demonstrated by an increase in average percentages on student assessments (Quizzes, Mid-Unit 
assessments, End of Unit assessments and F&P reading levels) and a 90% of teachers receiving effective or highly 
effective on Advance observations for component 4e (Growing and developing professionally).

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By the end of February 2019, the administrators will monitor the progress for this goal by looking at attendance rates 
for meetings/orientations/workshops, incidents reported on OORs and student behavior/work habits.  

The mid-point benchmarks that will indicate progress towards meeting this goal is demonstrated by an increase in 
attendance rate for meetings, orientations, and workshops; less incidents reported in OORs and improved student 
behavior and work habits. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
We will use attendance rates for meetings/orientations/workshops, incidents reported on OORs and student

intervention, social-emotional 
intervention, self-esteem 
enhancement, motivation 
booster, school bullying 
prevention and intervention, 
middle school articulation, 
parental education, and 
parental outreach regarding 
students’ behavior, social 
emotional and academic 
performances. The guidance 
counselors provide these 
services through parent 
meeting, group and/or 
individual counseling, 
classroom inter-visitations 
and student workshops. 

In addition, the school’s 
bilingual guidance counselors 
are providing after school 
parental workshops with their 
child/children on how 
interact/engage/communicate 
with their child/children 
through academic/social 
learning games. 

The school’s psychologist 
assesses, evaluates through 
informal testing 
(observations, interviews and 
parent meetings) and 
recommends services to at-
risk students identified by the 
classroom teacher. The school 
psychologist attends a 
monthly PPT (Pupil Personnel 
Team) meeting in which the 
team, which includes the 
school psychologist, reviews 
the teacher's 
recommendations and 
concerns. The team develops 
an action plan to support the

needs of the student. Cases 
are reviewed on a regular 
basis by the team to 
determine whether the plan 
of action is helping the child 
succeed. The team 
recommends services such as 
counseling, outside 
psychotherapy, related 
services (speech, occupational 
therapy, physical therapy or 
hearing), etc. 

The school’s social worker 
discusses and addresses 
teacher concerns regarding 
at-risk students. The social 
worker does classroom 
observations, conducts parent 
meetings and provides 
individual or group counseling 
(boost confidence, self-image, 
motivation, conflict 
resolution) to the identified 
at-risk student(s). The social 
worker articulates with 
classroom teachers and 
student providers to develop 
a support plan based on 
student needs. In addition, 
the social worker conducts 
parent education workshops 
to provide them with skills, 
strategies, resources, and 
parent rights to help children 
succeed in school.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,

State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 105K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 105K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

According to the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) a/o 10/9/18, we have identified 67 ELLs with 
at-risk level 3 or greater. These 67 students consist of: (Please note: some students overlap 
because they fall in more than 2 criteria.)

ELA 
· 
Math State exam.

According to the ATS RLAT and RESI report, we have identified 35 ELLs who are Expanding 
for the past 3 years and 99 ELLs who scored level 2 on the ELA.  In addition, we have 152 
ELLs in grades 1 and 2 who scored Expanding on the NYSESLAT.   
Our plan is to have an after school program, ELL Success After School Program, to target the 
needs of these 358 students.   
After School Program: 
The ELL Success After School Program will service ELLs in grades 1-5, with 15-18 students in 
each class.  The program will run from January 9 to March 28, 2019.  There will be 22 sessions 
which will meet twice a week, from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  All 
teachers will have one pre-service P.D. session before the program starts.  
There will be 17 classes. 12 classes will be focused on targeting the student needs according to 
the EDAT data (i.e. At-risk descriptions, regressed, remained Expanding 3 years in a row, or 
grades 1-2 Expanding students).  5 classes will be for enrichment (coding, book club, art club, 
music club, and physical education). 
Some of the teachers recruited for the ELL Success After School program will be licensed 
Chinese Bilingual Teachers who can support most of our Chinese speaking ELL students in their 
acquisition of the English language with Home Language support. The other teachers are 
licensed ENL teachers who will employ ENL strategies to support their learning.  The teachers 
who are not certified in ENL or bilingual will be co-planning with a ENL or bilingual certified to 
integrate ENL strategies. 
The target population for grades 1- 2 are Expanding ELLs.  We will analyze NYSESLAT data 
and target modality that each Expanding student is weak in (e.g. student scored lowest on 
Speaking modality which prevented the student from passing the NYSESLAT, the target will be 
the Speaking modality. ). The appropriate strategies/activities will be used to help students 
achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT.   
The target population for grades 3-5 are the ELLs mentioned above (at-risk level 3 or higher, 
regressed students, Expanding 3 years in row, ELA level 2, etc.).  These students will be in the 
regular classes or enrichment classes.   
All classes will focus on oral language acquisition, academic vocabulary, and literacy 
comprehension through

small groups, enrichment and Close Reading practices. 
Staff:  17 teachers (12 ENL/Bilingual, 5 Content Area for Enrichment) and 1 supervisor, which 
is needed for the program from 3:00 p.m. to 5:30 pm to oversee dismissal. 
Resources: 
Teachers will use leveled fiction and non-fiction guided reading books to support ELLs to build 
background knowledge, develop academic vocabulary and comprehension.  Home language 
materials in both Chinese and Spanish will also be provided to all classrooms to support and 
sustain the development of Home language for ELLs. 
Resources provided to teachers of the ELL Success After School are: 1) The Primary 
Comprehension Toolkit by Stephanie Harvey & Anne Goudvis, 2) Scaffolding for English 
Language Learners – Previews and Extensions to Support Content Comprehension in grades K-2 
and grades 3-6, 3) Comprehension Intervention – Small Group Lessons for The Primary 
Comprehension Toolkit in grades K-2, and grades 3-6, 4) ACT Now!Accessing Complex Texts – 
Model Lessons for Close Reading grades 3-8, 5) Short Reads for Finding Text Evidence by 
Benchmark Education in grades 3, 4 and 5.  6) Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, for grades 3-5 by 
Kate Kinella.  7) MaxPhonics and Maxreading application by Maxscholar for grades 1-
5.  7)  Getting Reading for the NYSESLAT by Attanasio & Associates. 8)Languagenut online 
bilingual program. 
 
Teachers in all grades will implement sentence frames to provide support and ensure progress of 
the English Language acquisition by providing proper language structure for students in both the 
oral and written language in their lessons.  Small group instruction will be provided according to 
students’ ability and needs. Teachers will incorporate Close Reading practices to support ELL 
students to access complex texts by scaffolding their lessons and modeling collaborative 
conversations, annotation of key words, phrases, key ideas, and details, numbering events and 
opinions.  The CCLS require all students to read closely to understand grade level complex texts 
and to cite specific text evidence when writing or speaking about the text.  Through Close 
Reading, students will learn to understand prompts and use text evidence to support their 
thinking and their writing.   Teachers will also have access to Award Reading, Raz-kids, 
Discovery Education in Science, BrainPop, and My Capstone Library ebooks by Capstone. 
For each program, all teachers take student attendance at each session.  In addition, the school 
aide calls each class for their attendance each day for her records.  Since 92% of our student 
population is Chinese, all written correspondences for parents are translated in Chinese for 
parents.

P.S. 105 is a school of ELLs.  Of the 1,426 student population, approximately 637 students are 
current ELLs, while 592 students are former ELLs.  The school provides on-going PDs to 
address all sub-group populations: ELLs, former ELLs, and students of special education.  For 
example, weekly grade meetings, Monday afternoon PDs, Tuesday afternoon PDs, Election PDs, 
etc.  Therefore, teachers working in the Title III program receive on-going PD to address student 
needs.

Part C: Professional Development  
PDs using Title III funds:  
1. The after school program has 1 scheduled PD session, a pre-service PD in January.  17 
teachers will be receiving PDs. This is a 2 hour PD session held after school from 3:00 p.m.-5:00 
p.m. The after school supervisor will be facilitating the PD session.  There will be agendas and 
attendance sheets for all PDs, which are maintained in a binder.  
Pre service PD activities: 
· 
service, comparing NYSESLAT raw scores, NYSESLAT modalities, comparing ELA and Math 
scores, progress on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math, growth percentiles, attendance, indicators-
SIFE, Average, holdover, Special Ed, etc.) 
· 
Language Progressions to address the varied abilities of each student. 
· 
· 
· 
 
2. Dance consultants - provide PD's to teachers focusing on dance literacy. Students will develop 
a working knowledge of dance language and aesthetics to promote their creativity and 
imagination. In addition, since 92% of our student population is of Chinese decent, there is a 
need to provide the knowledge and exposure of the Chinese cultural arts to cultivate our students' 
cultural pride and heritage. 
Ongoing PDs not using Title III funds: 
There are on-going professional development which is embedded in the teacher’s daily practice 
to facilitate student learning. Teachers learn to begin with an analysis of student data in order to 
plan whole class lessons and group activities to improve student achievement. Student progress 
will be evident through pre-assessments and post-assessments in the after school program.  There 
will be agendas and attendance sheets for all PDs, which are maintained in a binder.  Most PDs 
are done by Literacy /Math/STEM Coaches, Literacy Consultants, and Assistant Principals.   
To support various school instructional programs, school administrators, Literacy consultants, 
Art consultants, literacy coaches, math coaches, Lead Teachers, and ENL experts/consultants 
provide professional development in Balanced Literacy workshop model, ENL strategies, 
Language Allocation Policy, NYSESLAT data-driven instruction, and NYSESLAT/ELA 
alignment and item analysis, and workshops outside of the school. These professional 
development sessions are provided to all teachers since there are ELLs in all programs in the 
school. Currently these professional development sessions are scheduled from September 2018 
to June 2019 through the following activities: 
•      Daily classroom implementation which includes teacher observations, demonstration 
lessons, providing resources, and feedback to teachers etc. 
•       Curriculum planning horizontally and vertically across all grades to implement reading 
strategies and building academic vocabulary across the year to scaffold teaching and to ensure 
rigor for all learners. 
•       Weekly Professional Activity Periods(PAPs) 
•       Weekly common preparation planning period for all teachers 
•       Teacher Teams to moderate student work to inform instruction and fill gaps in the 
curriculum and teaching 
•       ELL focus professional development in embedding literacy skills in daily teaching to 
support and ensure ELLs to make progress on the NYSESLAT and the State ELA 
In addition to the above professional development activities, funded by Fair Student Funding.  
There will be PD sessions on how to implement the LAP in the bilingual classrooms 
successfully, how to use the questions in the "Specific Considerations for Teachers of English 
Language Learners" from Advance to promote ELL student learning, how to teach vocabulary

Parental Involvement – Family Fun Program: 
In the Family Fun Program, our Chinese bilingual guidance counselors: Betty Wan and Carol 
Chik, as well as our Chinese bilingual Social Worker, Ms. Jenny Wu, will work with parents 
alongside their children to bridge the generation gap, and help students bond with their parents in 
a fun way.  Some of our Chinese students are sent back to China to be raised by relatives until 
they are old enough to attend school in the U.S.  These students return to the U.S. without 
any  relationship or maternal bond with their parents. Through games and play, we will show 
children and their parents how to express their feelings under different situations without 
conflict. The program is designed to help students and parents develop better relationships and 
listening skills to resolve conflicts.  The Guidance counselors and the social worker will identify 
students and families who may benefit from the program and send letters/or call to invite them.  
There will be 11 sessions, 1.5 hours each session with 3 school staff at each session, for the 
Family Fun program. Games and resources will be provided to the family to take home and 
continue the activities. 
There will be a total of 11 sessions, separated into two cycles.  Cycle I will consist of 6 sessions, 
1.5 hour each session, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 p.m to 4:15pm. Cycle I will run 
approximately from November to January. Cycle II will consist of 5 sessions and will run 
approximately from January to April. Both cycles will service parents and students in grades K-
2. The guidance counselors and the social worker will plan out agendas for each cycle to address 
the specific needs of selected students. Each session may service up to 6  parents with their 
children. 
Agendas and attendance sheets will be kept in a binder in the main office.  Invitations to parents 
will be translated in Chinese and Spanish (if necessary).  All correspondences will be kept in the 
binder. 
Some topics to be covered: 
How parents and their children can verbalize and express feelings using feeling words, how to 
resolve conflicts between siblings, peers, and parents, how to be an attentive listener, how we 
communicate our feelings through tone of voice, facial expression, and body language, etc.

Part III: Assessment Analysis 
 
 

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Fountas and Pinnell to assess the early literacy skills of all students, including English Language Learners. 
Based on teachers’ assessment data, many ELL students cannot advance to the next level due to the lack of academic 
vocabulary, prior knowledge, and linguistic differences between Chinese and English.   Two of the major miscues preventing 
Chinese students from advancing to the next level are tenses and plurals. (ie. Reading the word walk instead of walks, or 
walkeded instead of walked) When the same miscue appears multiple times throughout the text, students’ final accuracy rate 
prevents them from moving on to the next level. Therefore, the school has decided when a student does not read word 
endings in tenses and plurals, it is counted as an error only the first time but is analyzed every time in order to get a clearer 
picture of a student’s reading behaviors.  It is also noted for instruction.  To address vocabulary development, specifically in 
Tier II and domain specific words, which prevent students from achieving satisfactory comprehension to advance to the next

level, teachers are asked to plan instruction with attention to vocabulary development.  To support teachers in this area, the 
school has purchased vocabulary development books for grades 1-5 with professional development from the publisher. The 
school has also purchased many leveled texts in the different genres in both fiction as well as informational text to support the 
language development of ELLs Teachers use these resources in their literacy block, extended day, and in the Title III after 
school programs.  In lesson planning, teachers will include a language objective as well as a content objective to ensure every 
lesson promotes language acquisition in the four modalities.  They will differentiate activities and tasks with leveled texts for 
their students. To promote oral language development and comprehension, teachers will incorporate Think-Pair Share, 
dramatizing stories and sentence frames.  To build background knowledge, teachers will plan field trips, conduct Read Alouds, 
Shared Reading and Guided Reading in the different genres.  
  
According to the Fountas &Pinnell data, as of May, 2017, there are more students who are reading independently at or above 
their grade levels in the early grades.  (Percentage of students reading at or above benchmark reading levels: Grade K - 52%, 
Grade 1 - 60%, Grade 2 - 45%, Grade 3 - 45%, Grade 4 - 51%, Grade 5 - 53%).  Some of the reasons are an influx of new admits 
to the US school system in grades four and five.  The demand in reading is much more complex in grades 4 and 5.  As a result, 
the school is conducting more Professional Development for teachers in how to use close reading strategies to help students 
read complex texts.  In addition, students who are reading below or approaching grade levels are receiving RTI, extended day 
or attend the after school program.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support the early childhood grades, when phonics instruction is essential, professional development on Orton 
Gillingham will be provided to teachers in grades K-2 in school year 2017-2018.  Orton Gillingham is an approach to reading 
instruction that is language-based, multisensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, cognitive, and flexible.  Teachers will 
receive 5 PD sessions from a contracted vendor; follow with support from the literacy coaches throughout the year to 
implement.  Coaches will guide teachers to develop a pacing calendar as well as reinforcement of the content in Orton 
Gillingham. 
For grades 3-5, teachers of all ELLs will continue to use the NLAP as well as the HLAP to plan differentiate and scaffold 
instruction for ELLs in reading comprehension.  Literacy consultants will continue to provide PD at weekly grade meetings on 
Closed Reading strategies to support ELL students access complex texts.  Students who are reading below or approaching 
grade levels as indicated on the ELA assessment results will receive RTI for small group intervention.  Mid-level II students and 
level 3 ELL students will be invited to attend after school programs or Saturday programs to support them to continue their 
progress. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Teachers use summative assessments such as the pre-assessment, mid-assessment, and end of unit assessments, MOSL, ELL 
Periodic Assessment, State assessment results on the ELA and Math, and the NYSESLAT to identify baseline, progress, and 
areas of need for ELL students. 
 
Progress is measured by the following:  
NYC Performance Tasks - Pre and Post 
Summative assessments - Unit pre-assessments and End of Unit assessments 
ELL Periodic Assessment - ELL Periodic Assessment and the NYSESLAT 
Progress is demonstrated by comparing Pre and Post. If the post is higher than the pre, then there is progress. 
 
We identified the following areas of needs: language acquisition, speaking, grammar, sentence starters, conversations and 
discussions, questioning, phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding skills, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In September, once we gather and analyze all the summative assessment results, we place students in the appropriate 
programs according to their needs: level 1 and low 2 students will receive RTI/AIS small group instruction, mid-level 2 and level 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

3 students in after school programs, and Saturday Programs (Depending on funding availability.) The structures in place will 
address the needs of all ELL students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
To support ELLs in grades 4-5, who scored level 1 on last year’s state test, they are receiving Tier II, additional small group 
targeted instruction with a reading teacher for 30 minutes daily.  ELLs who scored level 2 on last year’s state test, are offered 
Title III’s after school program.  All other ELLs receive Tier 1, rigorous and evidence –based curriculum, including English 
language development in small group instruction with the classroom teacher.   For ELLs in grades K-3, we use the F & P reading 
levels to determine level of support needed and use the same above model to support them.  The school will contract 
consultants to provide professional development on Orton Gillingham to teachers in grades K-2 to provide the essential 
phonics instruction for our ELL students. 
 
For grades K-5, our schools uses the independent Fountas & Pinnell Reading levels to determine the need for AIS/RTI. Students 
who are on level 1 as per "Teachers College Benchmark Reading levels and marking period assessments" will be targeted for 
AIS/RTI service.  In addition, for grades 4-5 (students with State ELA and Math scores), we use the scale scores as per State 
Mandated AIS/RTI benchmarks to target the students who need or at risk for RTI.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to the NYSITELL results from as of 9/15/17, 271 students took the NYSITELL.  The results are as follows: 154 (56.9%) 
Entering, 43 (15.9%) Emerging, 31 (11.4%) Transitioning, 24 (8.9%) Expanding, 19 (7%) Commanding.   This shows that most 
students are Entering.  
 
Out of all 271 students who took the NYSITELL, 250 are kindergarteners.  Most new ELLs are in Kindergarten and 154 of them 
are Entering.   
 
According to the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT, 33.5% of our ELLs passed (Passed by Grade: Grade K-36.8%, Grade 1- 37.1%, Grade 2-
44.4%, Grade 3-19.1%, Grade 4 – 37.6% and Grade 5 – 5.6%.)  Grades 2 and 4 have the highest percentage passing.  
Out of 792 ELLs who took the NYSESLAT, 2.3% were Entering, 8.5% were Emerging, 15.2% were Transitioning and 40.7% were 
Expanding.  The majority of students are on Expanding level.   
The ELL Data Analysis Tool for school year 2017-2018 is not available as of 9/15/17. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Once we receive the most updated NYSESLAT results, and the NYSITELL scores on all new incoming students in September, we 
will use the results to make adjustments to our programs.  All students who passed the NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL will be 
placed in monolingual classes.  Former ELL students will continue to receive 90 minutes of ENL support.  Self-contained ENL 
classes and self-contained Chinese Bilingual classes will have ELLs ranging from Entering to Expanding levels.  Our data 
specialist use the ELL Data Analysis Tool report (EDAT) to analyze data for each class.  Mrs. Alice Lee, assistance principal, will 
review the report with each grade level during weekly grade meetings to show teachers how to read the information on the 
report and how to use the information to group students according to their language levels, strengths and weaknesses on each 
of the modalities.  Classrooms that are self-contained and served by a licensed ENL teacher or bilingual teacher will provide the 
mandated ENL services to ELL students according to their needs.  Classrooms taught by non-ENL licensed teachers will be 
services by a push-in ENL teacher according to their needs.  The ATS report RESI is run to ensure all ELL students are in self-
contained ENL classes or bilingual classes where they receive the appropriate ENL services.  All classroom teachers with ELL 
students will indicate when students are receiving standalone or integrated ENL services, or Home Language Arts instruction 
on their program cards.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Freestanding ENL program (self-contained) in grades K-5.  All Self-Contained Freestanding ENL programs are 
taught by teachers who are dually certified in both ESL and the Common Branch license.  In classes where the teacher 
is not ESL licensed, a licensed ESL teacher will collaboratively work together with the classroom teacher to service 
ELLs.   All classes are heterogeneous grouped (mix of Advanced, Intermediate and Beginners) by grade.  ENL 
mandated minutes will be provided to students according to the new requirements as indicated per CR Part 154 for 
Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding levels.   
 
Integrated and Stand-alone ENL are implemented by the classroom teacher using flexible heterogeneous (mixed 
proficiency levels) grouping, e.g. grouped by modality or reading ability. All ELLs in an ENL program are placed in a 
self-contained class with a classroom teacher who is licensed in ENL and Common Branch. Therefore, all students are 
in one class.   
 
Stand-alone ENL: Entering students receive 180 ENL minutes of per week 
Integrated ENL/ELA: Entering students receive 180 ENL minutes per week 
 
Stand-alone ENL: Emerging students receive 90 ENL minutes per week 
Integrated ENL/ELA/Math/Science/Social Studies: Emerging students receive 90 ENL minutes per week in each of the 
ELA and content area 
 
Integrated ENL/ELA/Math/Science/Social Studies: Transitioning students receive 90 ENL minutes per week in each of 
the ELA and content area 
 
Integrated ENL/ELA/Math/Science/Social Studies: Expanding students receive a total of 180 ENL minutes per week in 
the ELA and/or content area 
 
Integrated ENL/ELA/Math/Science/Social Studies: Commanding students receive a total of 90 ENL minutes per week 
in the ELA and/or content area 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

P.S. 105 has Chinese Bilingual classes on each grade level, K-5.  All TBE programs are taught by licensed Bilingual 
teachers.  The mandated ENL minutes is integrated according to the new requirement as dictated per CR Part 154 for 
the 5 proficiency levels.  In all TBE classes, a Native Language Arts teacher will teach the Home Language Arts as a 
cluster. 
 
Integrated and Stand-alone ENL are implemented by the classroom teacher using flexible heterogeneous (mixed 
proficiency levels) grouping, e.g. grouped by modality or reading ability. All students in a bilingual program are placed 
in a self-contained bilingual class with a classroom teacher who is licensed in Bilingual and Common Branch. 
Therefore, all students are in one class.   
 
Stand-alone ENL: Entering students receive 180 ENL minutes of per week  
Integrated ENL/ELA: Entering students receive 180 ENL minutes per week 
 
Stand-alone ENL: Emerging students receive 90 ENL minutes per week 
Integrated ENL/ELA/Math/Science/Social Studies: Emerging students receive 90 ENL minutes per week in each of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80

in the ELA and/or content area 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A- We do not have DL program.  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The ELL Coordinator, Mrs. Alice Lee ensures that all identified ELLs are provided with the mandated number of instructional 
minutes according to their proficiency levels in each program model.  Teachers will indicate in their program cards (a copy in 
the main office and place on classroom door) the required Stand-alone ENL minutes,Integrated ENL minutes and HLA minutes. 
Teachers are to follow what's on their program card. Teachers' program cards are reviewed and approved by the ELL 
coordinator, Mrs. Alice Lee before it is posted on their classroom door. 
 
Mrs. Alice Lee uses the data from the ATS: RLAT and RLER reports (provided by the data specialist, Ms. Amy Chan) to assign 
teachers to provide ENL service for ELLs.  Mrs. Alice Lee creates the program/schedule for the ESL teachers and provides PD’s 
to the entire staff to ensure the delivery of ENL, ELA and NLA instructional minutes are delivered in each program model as per 
CR Part 154.  
  
Assistant Principal (ELL Coordinator), Alice Lee will review the new requirements as per CR Part 154 at the welcome back 
conference with the entire staff in the beginning of school year 2017-2018.  The implementation of Part 154-2 (K-8) English as 
a New Language (ENL) units of Study and staffing requirements will be explained and discussed.  For all self-contained or 
Freestanding ENL programs, teachers will incorporate requirements as per CR Part 154 requirements: Entering level students 
will receive 360 minutes of ENL, with a minimum 180 minutes of standalone ENL, and a minimum 180 minutes integrated 
ENL/ELA. Emerging Level students will receive 360 minutes of ENL, with a minimum 90 minutes of standalone ENL, a minimum 
180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA, and  a minimum 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content 
area.) Transitioning level students will receive a total 180 minutes of ENL, with a minimum of 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA, 
and a minimum of 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area.) Expanding level students 
will receive a total 180 minutes of ENL, with a minimum 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. 
Commanding level students will receive a minimum of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  All former 
ELLs will receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area for 2 years after reaching proficient/commanding 
level.  All self-contained Freestanding ENL classes are taught by teachers who are dually certified in both ESL and Common 
Branch.  In classes where the classroom teacher is not ESL certified, a certified ESL teacher will work collaboratively with the 
classroom teacher to service the ELLs.   One unit of study Home Language Arts (180 minutes) aligned with the CCLS will be 
taught in all TBE classes.  These units will be taught by the classroom teacher and/or by a Native language arts cluster 
teacher.   
  
In the beginning of the school year, teachers in the TBE programs, Self-contained and ENL programs are informed about the 
mandated number of instructional minutes for ELLs to be provided according to their proficiency levels which is indicated on 
their program cards. Self-Contained ENL and TBE classes would indicate on their program cards when ENL, ELA and NLA are 
taught during the day. All teachers of ELLs also received a copy of the NYSESLAT results with their students’ proficiency level in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

the four modalities (listening/speaking strands, and their reading/writing strands) in order to group their students for 
instruction.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ENL: 
P.S. 105 teachers have developed curriculum maps with units in literacy as well as Math, Social Studies, and Science, that are 
aligned to the Common Core Standards.  All teachers follow the unit plans on the curriculum map, regardless of their program 
model.  However, teachers differentiate their resources and instruction according to their students to teacher the 
content.  Teachers include a content objective as well as a language objective in their lessons. All teachers have access to 
grade level curriculum maps posted on the school server, including all supporting staff.  
In the Self-Contained classes, ELA and content areas are taught in English using ENL strategies.  Content area learning 
is  integrated with literacy.  The school provides many leveled books in Science, Math, and Social Studies, fiction and 
informational genres to support all ELLs in their learning.  Teachers use Close Reading strategies to support ELL students with 
complex text.  Content knowledge learning is infused in Read Alouds, Shared Reading and Guided Reading with ENL strategies 
(i.e. Use of visuals, TPR-Total Physical Response, CALLA, and dramatization).  The workshop model is implemented in all lessons 
with small group instructions to differentiate for students.  Teachers can form flexible grouping according to students’ needs in 
the four modalities, reading levels, or groups by skill based, etc.  Classes with ESL teachers provide the mandated ENL periods 
according to students’ proficiency levels.  They articulate and plan collaboratively with the classroom teachers to provide the 
appropriate support in content, strategies, and skills needed for each child to succeed. They support the classroom teachers in 
the teaching of content area by supporting students with ENL strategies in the learning of content knowledge, content 
vocabulary with a focus on the four modalities in language acquisition.  Any teacher who can speak the native language of the 
students in the Freestanding ENL classrooms are encouraged to use the native language to support student learning when 
necessary with translation or small group instruction.  Native language resources such as picture dictionaries and native 
language literature in Chinese/English, or Spanish/English are available in the classrooms to support student learning. 
  
TBE: 
In the TBE program, for language of instruction, teachers follow the suggested ratio in the Language Allocation Policy for 
English and the students’ native language.  However, differentiation is provided depending on the students’ English 
proficiency, and the time admitted to the U.S. school system. The delivery of instruction in the content area is in Chinese in 
accordance of the LAP.  In the upper grades, when students come with proficiency of the native language, teachers translate 
teaching materials with English side by side to ensure comprehension.  New concepts, skills and strategies are taught in the 
Native language, then taught in English using ESL strategies focusing on key vocabulary words in the content.    Students in TBE 
classes receive one period per day in the Native Language Arts to strengthen and maintain their native language skills.  To 
support teachers in the teaching of the native language, Effective Way of Learning to Listen, Speak, Read, and Write Chinese by 
Wendy Lin is used for the Chinese native language arts.  In addition, the school has purchased over $100,000 dollars worth of 
children’s literature in fiction and informational resources in Chinese/Spanish to support the learning of ELL students in their 
native language.  Many of these books are sent home with students daily to promote parental involvement in reading with 
their parents, especially in the younger grades.  For beginning ELLs, about 75% of the instruction is provided in the native 
language and 25% in English. The percentage of instruction in English will increase as the students’ English proficiency 
increases. For Transitioning ELLs, the language allocation is about 50:50 and for the Expanding ELLs, about 25:75.  
In addition to the Workshop Model in Balanced Literacy, all program models have access to the following resources to support 
ELLs in their learning: Award Reading (K-3), On Our Way to English (K-5), Discovery Education in Science (on-line subscription), 
Capstone e-books, Mylibrary (on-line subscription), books with CDs and audio tapes, BrainPop, Benchmark Comprehension 
Strategies for ELLs, Heinemann’s Primary Comprehension Toolkit for ELLs in grades K-6, etc.  
  
The school aligns all instruction to the Common Core Learning Standards on all units of studies on the curriculum maps. All 
contents on the curriculum map are non-negotiable.  All students are held to the same standards with differentiation and 
scaffolding according to their learning needs. All programs including extended day and after school programs follow and 
implement these expectations.       

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82 

 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Bilingual classroom teachers and the Home language Arts cluster teachers will use the Home Language Arts Progressions to 
evaluate ELL students’ home language throughout the year. Since teachers in the bilingual classes use the native language as 
the language of instruction in the content area, teachers use observations and one-to-one conferences to evaluate ELLs in their 
learning throughout the year. On-going progress monitoring checklists are created to track student progress. 
To assess learning of the bilingual students, bilingual teachers use the Side-by-Side model where unit tests are translated in the 
native language to evaluate student learning in the content areas as well as major concepts and skills in literacy.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instructional Plans for sub-groups: 
a. SIFE: 
Once ELL students are identified as SIFE students, in addition to their daily learning with the classroom teacher in small group 
instruction, they will receive Tier II RTI in small groups.  They will be offered the Title III funded ELL Success After School 
Program and/or the Saturday Academy.  Our Pupil Personnel Team will discuss and plan any additional academic intervention 
for these students in consultation with their parents and the classroom teachers. 
  
b. Newcomer: 
New comer ELLs are invited to participate in supplemental programs funded by Title III’s after school ELL Success program as 
well as the Saturday Academy and summer school to strengthen their social and academic language skills.  In grade K-3, 
students who are reading below grade levels are identified and supported by an out of classroom AIS teacher in a 30 minutes 
small group instruction daily.  The focus for new admits is oral language, while others focus on reading and the content 
areas.  ELLs in grades 4 and 5 who scored level 1’s on last year’s ELA receive Tier II RTI for 30 minutes daily with an out of 
classroom teacher.  ELLs who need to take the ELA after one year will be supported by attending the Title III after school 
program and/or the Saturday Academy Program.  Teachers with these students in TBE classes and self-contained classes will 
provide differentiated small group instruction.   Students in TBE classes will learn content in their native language and content 
vocabulary in ENL periods. 
All teachers in grades 3-5 receive professional development in Testing as a Genre where they will incorporate skills and 
strategies students need to perform well on the ELA in their daily lessons.   
  
c. Developing: 
ELL students receiving ENL services for 4-6 years, and has not shown progress on the NYSESLAT or other standardized state 
tests, may indicate a need other than language. These Potential Long Term ELL student profiles are discussed at PPT meetings 
for possible interventions as well as possible referrals.  They are invited to attend supplemental programs funded by Title III 
after School and Saturday ELL Success programs. The school also provides workshops to parents of ELLs at PTA meetings to 
engage parents to support the learning of their children.  Teachers will also meet with parents 1:1 on Tuesday afternoons to 
discuss and develop action plans for these students.  Teachers differentiate and target the needs of these ELLs.  Their progress 
is closely monitored to determine effectiveness of instruction and strategies.   
  
d. Long Term: 
We do not have ELLs receiving services after 6 years.  However, in the event that we have long-term ELLs, we will follow the 
same procedure as we would with ELLs receiving services for 4-6 years.  
  
e. Former ELLs: 
Former ELLs will be receiving push in integrated ENL/ELA or other content area services, 2 periods per week, 90 minutes as 
part of the new CR Part 154. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83 

 

Former ELLs are invited to attend the Title III After School Program as well as AIS program according to their needs.  All Former 
ELLs will continue to receive testing accommodations within two years of becoming commanding on the NYSESLAT. 
     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All teachers follow the curriculum map and units of study written by teachers on each grade.  All units are aligned to CCLS 
using the Understanding By Design Unit template listing the unit’s big idea, learning outcomes aligned to CCLS, understandings, 
essential questions, knowledge, skills, vocabulary, resources, assessment evidence, learning intentions of each lesson, and 
differentiation and scafflolding under Universal Design for Learning. (Where teachers show the ‘what’ ‘how’ and ‘why’) All 
teachers will begin with a pre-assessment before beginning each unit to compact the curriculum to plan and differentiate for 
their students according to their needs. Teachers with ELL-SWDs will adjust the curriculum according to student’s individual 
ability and their IEP goals.  Teachers are asked to include a content objective as well as a language objective in each of their 
lessons to ensure that our ELLs and former ELLs continue to develop and improve their English language skills. 
  
All materials and resources purchased by the school are available to support all classes and all students.  Bilingual classes have 
bilingual resources.  Teachers often translate and create their own resources to support student learning of the content in 
their home language. 
Some strategies for ELL-SWDs include: Total Physical Response (TPR), visuals, charts, sentence frames, chanting, technology, 
hands on activities, ESL through the arts, Think Pair Share, etc.   
Native language materials used include: Picture dictionaries, bilingual children's literature, and teacher made instructional 
resources.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The school implements Balanced Literacy with the workshop model to address the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs. Teachers 
servicing the ELLs use assessment data to differentiate instruction as per IEP.   
The school's student population is over 90% Chinese and we have the bilingual staff to support their language needs. 
Bilingual Staff include: two assistant principals, a social worker, two guidance counselors, a school psychologist, a family 
worker, a parent coordinator, a school aide, a school nurse, a resource room teacher (SETSS), two speech teachers, two ESL 
push-in teachers, one AIS pull out teacher. For the Spanish speaking students, there are classroom teachers who are bilingual 
in Spanish as well as one school aide (used for translation).  
The school supports the learning of ELL-SWD with the many Freestanding ESL classes and bilingual classes on all grade levels K-
5.  All classes are taught in the workshop model with small group instruction differentiated for student needs.  The leveled 
books in the different genres and the bilingual resources in all classrooms support all learners.  All teachers are provided with 
professional development to use ESL strategies to differentiate and support the learning of all ELL students, including ELL 
students with IEPs. Teachers plan and differentiate instruction using the contents on the unit plans of the curriculum map on 
their grade level to address the needs of their diverse learners. 
Our school reviews IEP’s annually to reassess students’ needs.  Students are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine 
whether they are meeting their goals and/or if their IEP goals need adjustments (accommodations in the classroom).  The SAT 
(School Assessment Team) team along with the classroom teacher carefully evaluate each student’s strengths and weaknesses 
to recommend flexible programs that benefit the child the most.  Ex. If the child does not need Special education services in 
Math, we would recommend the child attend math in a General Education class.  Many students with special needs are in a 
general education class, receiving support services. This flexible programming approach is used to ensure students are 
receiving quality instruction in the least restrictive environment.        
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs: 
ELA – All classes implement Balanced Literacy with the workshop model.  In TBE and Self-Contained classes, teachers use the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

NYSESLAT proficiency levels to group students for targeted instruction according to their strengths and weaknesses. Reading is 
taught in the different genres and content areas using leveled books according to students’ reading abilities. Content area 
learning is often integrated in the literacy components. Based on the trends from the most current NYSESLAT results, many 
upper grade students were weaker in speaking and listening skills.  Many of our students cannot achieve proficiency due to 
their lack of academic vocabulary, Tier II words, and grammar.  Therefore, we have purchased resources and provided 
professional development to teachers in these areas.  The after school programs and extended day programs are focusing on 
the development of academic vocabulary, Tier II words, and grammar in their instruction.  
Chinese bilingual students receiving ESL services for 4-6 years or more may be supported with Chinese Bilingual at-risk or 
mandated resource room, RTI reading, Title III funded After School ELL Success Program, and or the Saturday Academy with 
licensed Bilingual/ESL teachers. 
  
Math – All classes use the TERC Investigation Math curriculum. Students in TBE classes are taught math concepts and skills in 
their native language.  Students in Self-Contained classes are taught math concepts and skills with ESL strategies. Potential 
Long term ELLs may be supported with Chinese Bilingual at-risk or mandated resource room, AIS reading, Title III funded After 
School ELL Success Program, and or the Saturday Academy with licensed Bilingual/ESL teachers. 
  
Content Area – All classes use the Common Core Standards based curriculum map to teach Math, Social Studies and Science. 
Students in TBE classes are taught content concepts and skills in their native language.  Students in Self-Contained classes are 
taught content concepts and skill with ESL strategies.  However, teachers who speak the students’ native language may 
support their learning using the native language in small group instruction.  Potential Long term ELLs may be supported with 
Chinese Bilingual at-risk or mandated resource room, RTI reading, Title III funded After School ELL Success Program, and or the 
Saturday Academy with licensed Bilingual/ESL teachers.     
  
The following students are targeted:   
ELA level 1 ELLs are receiving AIS/RTI Tier II services 
ELA level 2 ELLs are in the after school ELL Success program 
  
Math level1 ELLs are receiving AIS Math service 
Math level 2 ELLs are in the after school ELL Success program 
Science level 1 ELLs are receiving targeted small group instruction in their classroom 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the F&P running records/assessment data, we have identified the following areas of needs: language acquisition, 
speaking, grammar, sentence starters, conversations and discussions, questioning, phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding 
skills, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
 
The new programs or improvements being considered for the coming school year will be: 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Since all of the programs and services are essential to the success of ELL students, all programs and services will continue, as 
long as funding permits.   However, if we lose funding in Title III, we may have to eliminate the after school enrichment 
programs in dance and violin for our ELLs which we began in school year 2014-2015.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All school programs are offered to all students. For example, ELLs are offered to join the chorus, band, violin, and the Student 
Leadership Team.   Supplemental services such as the RTI, ELL Success After School Program and the Saturday Academy are 
offered to students according to their scores, levels, or needs, including all ELLs.  Due to the large numbers of ELLs, to ensure 
equity, students are invited to attend the different programs according to their needs/scores/levels: RTI, ELL Success After 
School, and/or Saturday Academy.  To maintain and promote students cultural pride and awareness, every year, twelve of our 
classes in grades K-5, GLOBE and bilingual participate in a Chinese Folk Dance program taught by an outside consultant funded 
by Title III funds.       

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85 

 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is used to support ELLs by motivating students and enhancing lessons. We use it as a tool to differentiate lessons 
to meet individual student needs. The school has purchased many resources to support the teaching and learning of our ELLs 
in all content areas. 
We use the following technology tool/instructional materials: Online Capstone Ebooks, Award Reading, Reading A-Z, Discovery 
Education in Science, National Geographic Ladders for science, World Book on line resources, on-line resources for math from 
Investigations, Max Phonics, My Library, Chinese Ebooks from China Sprout, and Chinese Language Arts iPad App. 
Teachers use Smart Boards, mimio Boards, document cameras or iPads to enhance their lessons.  For reading, we have many 
books with CDs, On Our Way to English, Comprehension Skills Kits, Anchor Comprehension Leveled books by Benchmark, 
native language books in children literature, content area, and dictionaries.  Students are encouraged to take home native 
language literature to read with their parents on a regular basis.  ELLs of all levels and in all classrooms have access to these 
resources. 
Award Reading is used for small group instruction during literacy block according to their needs (comprehension, phonics, oral 
language development, listening and speaking, etc.). Max Phonics is used during literacy block for 10-15 minutes of 
individualized instruction according to its assessment. Online Capstone Ebooks are used during guided reading, shared reading, 
and assigned as a homework for reinforcement. Chinese Ebooks and Chinese Language Arts iPad app,"3QQQ" are used for 
teaching and supporting the development of HLA for bilingual students.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

TBE: 
In the TBE classes, for beginning ELLs, about 75% of the instruction would be provided in the native language and 25% in 
English. The percentage of instruction in English will increase as the students’ English proficiency increases. For Transitioning 
ELLs, the language allocation is about 50:50 and for the Expanding ELLs, about 25% of the instruction would be in the native 
language and 75% in English. 
ENL\ESL:  
In the Self-Contained ENL classes, all instruction is delivered in English using ENL strategies unless the classroom teacher 
speaks the child’s native language. In that case, for new comers, the teacher is encouraged to introduce a lesson in the content 
area in Chinese first, and then use ENL strategies to teach the lesson, and sum up in Chinese again to assess learning.  To 
support ELLs, all classes are provided with picture dictionaries and bilingual dictionaries/glossaries, and native language 
literature. Whenever possible, teachers will use a "Buddy System" to support new ELLs.       
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

With the Balanced Literacy approach, teachers teach reading and the content area with leveled books that are differentiated 
by students’ reading levels, grade levels, and skill sets needed. Classroom teachers and ENL providers are provided with data 
on the latest NYSESLAT and other available assessment data on Schoolnet in order to group and differentiate instruction 
according to students’ needs.       
 
The school ensures that all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade. Teachers use all 
available assessment data to determine ELLs' content area levels and HLA levels in order to order/select appropriate resources 
to support them (e.g. High interest low reading level content area books for upper grade students.).  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share our building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
For the incoming kindergarten students who registered before the school year begins, parent orientations with the incoming 
students are conducted in the summer by the Guidance Counselor(Chinese bilingual), and the Parent Coordinator(Chinese 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86 

 

 

bilingual) to inform parents and students of school routines, and to familiarize them with the physical building in order to ease 
their transition for September.   
In addition, out of classroom teachers work with new ELLs in language acquisition during the month of September and October 
(i.e. teach them how to ask for "bathroom" and locate and say important places such as gym, cafeteria, main office, etc.)   
For students who enroll throughout the school year, buddy students are assign to assist new students in class. In addition to 
working with the classroom teachers in small group, they are invited to after school programs, Saturday academy, or oral 
language support by an AIS teacher in small groups for extra support.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently, our school does not offer language electives to students. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Closed Reading Strategies 
Computer: SMART Board and mimio Board technology  
 All of our teachers received PD on the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards and the citywide Instructional 
shifts.  Teachers on each grade, monolingual, ESL, and Bilingual teachers are all involved in the writing of the units on the 
curriculum maps on their grade level.  Professional development is provided to teachers weekly at a grade meeting.   
These professional development sessions include: 
•     Writing and aligning Rubrics to the CCLS 
•     Creating and scaffolding lesson plans on units with appropriately challenging tasks that are rigorous 
•     Looking at student work to inform next steps

NYSESLAT, ELL Periodic Assessment, etc 
•     Overview of the NYSESLAT to determine challenges for students 
•     How to create daily lesson plans to teach strategies and skills needed to succeed on the NYSESLAT 
•     How to implement Close Reading strategies to help ELL students comprehend complex texts 
•     How to teach vocabulary and grammar to ELL students 
•     How to target student needs in small group instruction 
 
All of the above Professional Development are also offered to the non-pedagogic staff, e.g. paraprofessionals, guidance 
counselors, school psychologist, family worker, related service providers. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Guidance Counselors provide workshops to Fifth Grade Teachers, parents and students to explain the application process 
and the various programs offered in the middle schools, and make appropriate program recommendations for ELLs students. 
They arrange inter-school visits for fifth grade classes to visit the middle schools to familiarize ELL students with middle school 
settings.  The Guidance Counselors (Chinese Bilingual) addresses concerns of the ELL parents.  They also assist students and 
parents in the application process. 
The 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers of ELL- specific professional 
development is provided to the staff in multiple ways:  
We provide on-going in-house training conducted by Assistant Principals, Generation Ready consultants, Literacy and math 
coaches during weekly Professional Activity Periods, classroom demonstrations, and PD dates (Mondays' 80 minutes, 
Chancellor's PD days).  In addition, all teachers are encouraged to attend outside workshops on best instructional practices for 
ELL students.  The school funds these workshops with Title III funds.   
Our school keeps binders for all weekly Professional Developments.  The school administrators keep and maintain a binder of 
all in-house PD’s for ELLs.  In addition, the payroll secretary keeps a binder of all external PD’s that teachers attend throughout 
the year.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parental Involvement:  
1. Public School 105 conducts Parent Orientation Meetings and parent workshops throughout the year at PTA meetings. At

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Johanna Castronovo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the ATS reports: RHLA (Home Language Aggregation), RPOB (Place of Birth Report) and the RAPL (Adult 
Preferred Language Report) to assess the language needs of our school. 

Our school's data specialist downloads these reports from ATS and analyzes them using Microsoft Excel. The 
analysis is completed yearly and is presented to the principal and parent coordinator. 

In addition, the results of Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) and student emergency contact cards 
show that Chinese is the language that is most preferred by the parents for written and for oral communication, 
Mandarin (Chinese dialect).

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We hire a staff that is bilingual to accommodate everyone's language needs. We utilize every staff member to help 
limited-English-proficient families in the event of a school emergency.  

Our school provides language assistance for languages that our school personnel does not speak by contacting the 
DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit. 

 

Through phone messages and Remind.com, our school sends home messages in English and Chinese translations to 
parents. Our parent coordinator translates the messages in Chinese. In addition, we utilize eChalk to create our school 
website. The website is translated in 80 languages. Users select the languages they want to see.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The principal shares the information on Chancellor's Regulation A-663 during faculty conference to all staff. Handouts 
with this regulation and contact information are given to all staff. In addition, the contact information for the DOE's 
Translation and Interpretation Unit is posted in the main office for the staff to utilize. 

 

All Chancellor's Regulations are posted on our school server.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school has a large number of Chinese bilingual staff. At least 70% of our staff is bilingual. We have teachers who 
can speak, read, and write in these two identified languages: Chinese and Spanish. This enables us to provide efficient, 
quality, and timely written translation services to our parents. We allocate per session positions for written 
translation in these two languages. The per session hours allocate for these positions will be flexibly allocated 
according to the actual language needs of the school. Teachers hired for the proposed positions will work on flexible 
hours before/after school as needed to translate or update documents. The school assigns a supervisor to monitor the 
materials to be translated and make sure that they are approved under NYCDOE guidelines and not a duplicate of a 
translation done by the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.

In addition, teachers collaborate as a grade during Tuesday parent involvement time to create monthly newsletters 
which is translated in the parents’ native language in order to keep parents informed about curriculum, projects and 
activities.  

Our school has always been doing its best to provide its parents with quality translation services. The school began 
translating all school correspondences and important DOE documents since the early nineties. With the translation 
and interpretation services provided at all events, the communication between school and parents has been greatly 
enhanced. Many more parents participate at PTA meetings and parent teacher conferences or come to volunteer at 
school.  

On a regular basis, there are approximately 200 to 300 parents attending our PTA meetings. We have parents on the 
SLT who do not speak English. To ensure understanding and participation, the assistant principal or the parent 
coordinator translates at the meetings. The parents are now better informed about the school’s curriculum, the 
learning standards, and the testing requirements. They are also better informed about different programs offered for 
the students in the school and their rights to choose among these programs. The increased contacts and inquiries 
from parents indicates that they are now more involved in their child/children’s education and understand how to 
fulfill their responsibility as parents. This would not have been possible if we didn't have comprehensible oral and 
written communication between the school and the parents, which is always provided in translation. With additional 
funding from the DOE for translation services and the plans we outlined above, we believe that our parents’ language 
needs are being addressed and the requirements of CR A-663 are met.  

 

Posters for help with translations in 10 different languages are posted on the bulletin board by the school entrance. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school gathers feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services during PTA and School Leadership 
Team (SLT) meetings. Feedback is given to the principal and the principal then creates plans to ensure effective and 
efficient communication with all parents. 

In addition, the parent coordinator schedules a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages 
represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices on communicating with families.
