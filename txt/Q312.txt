Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

At Jamaica Children's School we challenge all children to think critically, collaborate, and take risks. Students engage 
daily in joyful exploration, inquiry, and self-reflection. Through hands-on activities, small group work, and 
individualized support, our students develop the confidence, knowledge, and skills necessary to discover their 
passions and lead with empathy in our complex world. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Jamaica Children’s School is a new and growing elementary school serving families in the vibrant community of South 
Jamaica, Queens. We launched with two kindergarten classes in September 2014 and currently serve students in 
kindergarten through fourth grade. We currently have one general education class and one integrated co-teaching 
class on every grade as well as a K-2 self-contained class. We currently have 204 students in our school and 96% of our 
students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Our school’s mission and core values guide the development, revision, and 
implementation of school-wide goals, action plans, and curriculum. 

 

Core Values: 

Empathy: We care about others and strive to understand and share their feelings. 

Grit: We are passionate about our goals and bravely overcome obstacles to achieve them. 

Inquiry: We are curious and continuously ask questions to reach new understandings. 

Creativity: We challenge ourselves, and others, to look at the world in innovative ways. 

Voice: We express our ideas, feelings and beliefs, and advocate for ourselves, and others. 

 

Our strengths are evident in our cohesive school culture and significant student achievement. We have a clear vision 
of teaching and learning connected to our deeply rooted belief that every child can learn at a high level. Through our 
implementation of the Responsive Classroom approach to discipline we use common language to address off-culture 
behavior and support individual students’ social and emotional development. School-wide systems, predictable 
routines, and consistent expectations for all students have enabled student learning to be at the forefront of our 
work. 

 

We currently partner with Education Through Music to bring a comprehensive music education program to all of our 
students. Additionally, we partner with the YMCA and every second grade students participates in swimming lessons. 

 

Each content area is guided by essential questions throughout the school year. These essential questions are 
addressed through curriculum units connected to specific long term learning targets. Each unit has a culminating 
project or learning task where students are challenged to prove their mastery of the learning target through critical 
thinking. To facilitate student learning throughout the unit, teachers use open-ended questioning techniques and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

rigorous checks for understanding. They create opportunities for student-to-student discussion, small group work and 
student choice, and hold every child accountable for articulating the learning target and how they will reach it. 
Additionally, we have developed core vocabulary for each unit. Students are able to acquire new words because our 
team encourages them to create actions for each word, use the words in their writing, during conversation, and 
during content related field trips for each unit. 

 

Teachers use a variety of data sources to collaboratively plan targeted lessons and develop differentiated student 
groups within each unit. We use standards-based learning targets to frame each lesson in kid-friendly “I can” 
statements that encourage students to take ownership of their learning and practice reflection. Students are 
challenged to prove their mastery towards a standard and identify next steps in order to reach it. The ongoing use of 
formative and summative assessments inform instruction and student groupings. 

 

As a result, in the last four years our students have made an average of 1.4 years of growth in reading as measured by 
the Fountas & Pinnell Running Records Assessment. This past school year our students with disabilities demonstrated 
an average of .93 years of growth in reading and our ELLs demonstrated .88 years of reading growth. Additionally, 
95% of students demonstrated mastery of at least 80% of the Common Core Learning Standards in math. During our 
first year of state testing, 55% of students scored on or above grade level, outperforming the state average by 10 
points.  

 

Our data indicates that our reading instruction and programming is effective and resulting in significant student gains. 
During our first year of state testing in math, 29% of our 3rd grade students scored on or above grade level. 
Therefore, we are focused on strengthening student mastery and problem solving in math. More specifically, we are 
focused on streamlining and improving math curriculum, assessments, and outcomes across the school. We will 
achieve this by evaluating the math progression across grades K-4, meeting in vertical teams to analyze math data, 
using formative assessment to plan targeted math groups, redesigning our schedule to provide more math 
instructional time, strategic conferring and differentiation in math, continuing to build critical thinking skills, 
improving student attendance, developing new opportunities for family involvement, and improving learning 
outcomes for all students including out Students With Disabilities and our ENL students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Currently, 96% of our students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. 24% of our students have special needs, 5% of 
our students are English Language Learners, 2% of our students live in temporary housing, and 10% of our students 
currently in or recently came out of foster care. Every child we serve is unique. However, our data indicates that our 
students with disabilities --who are recommended for programs ranging from related services in general education 
classrooms, integrated co-teaching classrooms, and self-contained classrooms and receive a variety of services 
depending on their needs including speech and language, counseling, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and 
hearing services --need additional supports with reading comprehension and skills to help them discuss events in the 
text and think beyond the text by making inferences and thinking critically. Additionally, we have a group of students 
who would benefit from additional direct instruction to memorize and retain letter sounds and sight words. In 
reading, our English Language Learners benefit from exposure to new vocabulary and opportunities to apply it 
through conversation. Students also need support with math fluency and problem solving.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

Based on school survey data and student outcomes, we made strong strides in trust across that school that led to 
even stronger teacher teams, family engagement, and student achievement. Additionally, our professional learning

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

STRENGTHS: 

 

Programming 

We think outside the box when making programming decisions to maximize student learning time and provide 
differentiated instruction across the school. 

  We have a unique programming element where half of the class will attend art while the other half remains in 

the homeroom for targeted small group literacy instruction. Then, the two groups swap. This enables 
students to receive highly differentiated reading instruction by cutting the student-teacher ratio in half. All 
students in grades K-2 have half groups three days a week. Students in grade 3-4 have 100 minute literacy and 
math blocks throughout the week. 

  Once a week our K-4 classes participate in a reading rotation period. Our teachers meet in vertical teams and 
analyze our data and student work across all grades to make 16 differentiated groups for reading. During the 
rotation, students from different classes in kindergarten, first, second,third, and fourth grade come together 
with a specific teacher for targeted instruction in reading. Once a month, all teachers collaboratively analyze 
data to revise the groups. Then, using the common core standards and Depth of Knowledge guidelines, we 
design an instructional plan to address gaps in student learning or provide enrichment. 

  This fall we will launch an additional support for targeted students with literacy and math intervention groups 

that meet twice a week. These groups will be flexible and based on student across the entire school. The 
student grouping and instruction will target our lowest performing students in each grade. 

 

Learning Targets 

We participated in a deep study of Ron Berger’s “Leaders of their own Learning: Transforming Schools Through 
Student-Engaged Assessment.” As a result, we have implemented several strategies to ensure CCLS alignment in our 
planning. We encourage students to take ownership of their learning through learning targets, ongoing checks for 
understanding, and self-assessment. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

  Developed directly from our essential questions and the standards, teachers design units with long-term and 

supporting learning targets in the form of student-friendly “I can” statements. Teachers launch units by 
showing students what they will need to do by the end of the unit using rubrics as a guide. They post, discuss, 
and reference the daily supporting learning target during every lesson. 
Students know they are accountable to prove they can meet the target or identify the steps they will take to 
reach it. You will hear teachers say, “Prove it” when discussing the target a student is working on. 

 

  During conferring meetings, teachers guide students to track their own progress towards the standards-based 
long-term targets in a self-assessment binder and the use of self-assessment rubrics. Students are encouraged 
to identify what they need to work on in order to meet the target. 

  As a result, students are motivated to meet their targets, take risks during class discussion and group 

challenges, and engage in purposeful work towards their target. You can hear students confidently share, “I’m 
not there YET” when assessing if they can prove mastery of a supporting or long-term target. 

 

 

Assessment and Teacher Teams 

We received well developed in our Quality Review for our use of Assessments and the collaboration of our Teacher 
Teams. 

  Teachers work together to customize instruction by using formative and summative assessments to create 
differentiated student groups for support during independent practice, reading and math centers, guided 
reading, and small group instruction. 
Student engage in self-assessment and peer assessment during various components of the day. 

 
  Each student has an assessment binder where they confer with teachers to track and identify which reading, 
writing, and math goals they have mastered and which they haven’t met yet. Then they determine next steps 
to master the learning target. 

  Teachers explicitly plan and push one another to include meaningful open-ended questions in their lessons to 

promote higher order thinking. 

  Teachers create opportunities for small group work where students are given a challenging task and have to 

demonstrate their critical thinking skills in order to accomplish it. 

  Teachers often launch with an open-ended question to challenge students to drive the learning and teach one 

another through genuine discussion. 

  Teachers use flexible groupings and differentiation throughout the day to ensure that every student is being 
challenged and has access to the CCLS. Some groups are pre-planned based on various data points and some 
are developed after on-the-spot checks for understanding during instruction. 

  Teachers differentiate learning tasks to accommodate a variety of learners, including students with disabilities 

and English language learners. The use of scaffolds, manipulatives, visuals, technology, and movement are 
evident in classrooms. For instance, some students benefited from an oral sound drill to learn the letters 
while others needed to trace the letters in shaving cream on a table to master them. 

 

Student AchievEment  

For the past four years our students made an average of 1.3 years of growth in reading as measured by the Fountas & 
Pinnell Running Records Assessment. This past school year our students with disabilities demonstrated an average of 
1.07 years of growth in reading, a three month growth improvement from last year. Additionally, 95% of students 
demonstrated mastery of at least 85% of the Common Core Learning Standards in math. On the state exams, 55% of 
3rd graders scores at or above grade level in ELA and 29% in mathematics. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

 

Narrative Writing and Peer Assessment 

  Through our partnership with Teacher's College we successfully implement the Writing Workshop Model 

across grades 

  Based on observations, writing samples, and rubric assessments, students are engaging in the process of 

identifying writing goals and engaging in peer and self-assessment. 

NEEDS 

  As our school continues to grow we need to develop systems and structures to measure the effectiveness 

of math instruction and the progression of skills and content across grades. 

  Our data indicates that there are gaps in student mastery of math standards. We want to strengthen our 

formative assessments by increasing the rigorous to measure student's ability to critically think in math as 
well as whether they are able to apply knowledge and skills from previous units and previous grades. 

  We want to revise and strengthen our curriculum to include common core shifts in math, depth of 

knowledge, math fluency, and rigorous opportunities for critical thinking and writing in math.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified

  Through relationship building, teachers will learn about 

their student’s learning styles to better meet their needs 
and differentiate their instruction. 

 

  Teachers will use ongoing checks for understanding to 
adjust their instruction, planning, and student groups. 
In accordance with the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching, students will assess their own work using self-
assessment rubrics and checklists. Students will identify 
their areas of growth and how they will meet the 
learning target. They will develop math goals and 
capture them in their student assessment binders. 

  Teachers will use models they create and student models 
to demonstrate examples of quality work and that there 
are multiple ways to reach an answer.

  Teachers will plan content related field trips to support 
student’s math development and expand their schema 
which will help broaden their base for applying math 
skills into real world contexts. 

  Teachers will implement modes of differentiation to 

meet the needs of diverse learners including SWDs and 
ELLs. This will be done through small group work, 
conferencing, differentiated checklists, manipulatives, 
visual supports, and math word wall pictures.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Our core values serve as a guide for how we establish and refine our school culture to ensure that it is a supportive 
environment. 

Core Values:  

Empathy: We care about others and strive to understand and share their feelings. 

Grit: We are passionate about our goals and bravely overcome obstacles to achieve them. 

Inquiry: We are curious and continuously ask questions to reach new understandings. 

Creativity: We challenge ourselves, and others, to look at the world in innovative ways. 

Voice: We express our ideas, feelings and beliefs, and advocate for ourselves, and others. 

 

STRENGTHS: 

 

  We have a cohesive school culture that aligns to our school’s mission and core values. 
 
  Prior to the start of school, we intentionally mapped out our ideal school culture and developed norms for 

Staff uses a common language to promote positive behavior and community. 

communication. 

  Through our implementation of the Responsive Classroom approach to discipline, we use common language 

to address off-culture behavior and support individual students’ social and emotional development. 

  We have school-wide systems, predictable routines, and consistent expectations for all students. 
  We develop individualized behavior plans to support specific students. 
  We believe that teacher actions lead to student actions and consistently reflect on our practice and its impact 

on our school community and culture. 
Students actively take risks by asking and answering questions and trying things outside of their comfort zone. 

 
  Through daily learning centers, our students development language and skills to problem solve through play. 
  We incorporate student choice into our lessons and school routines. 
  Based on a recent family survey, students and families feel safe, welcomed, and positive about the school 

community we share.

  Throughout most of the day, students are in small groups working on academic challenges that are aligned to 

their specific needs and strengths. 

 

 

NEEDS: 

 

  We do not currently have a systematic response or action plan to support students in crisis. Although we have 
received effective and highly effective scores on the Quality Review rubric in these indicators we would like to 
continue strengthening our practice. 

We need to build on our strategies and knowledge base to better support students in crisis and to proactively look for 
trends that lead to off-culture behavior. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By May 2019, the number of students sent out of class for behavioral concerns will be reduced by 80% as measured in 
our anecdotal records and send out tracking system.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

STRENGTHS: 

  We received Highly Effective on our Quality Review in this are due to the following practices: 
  Our core values guide our work and communication. 
  We collectively designed a set of norms for communication that is evident in the focused, friendly, and 

supportive nature of our professional learning workshops and meetings. 

  Grade teams collaboratively plan and use the same learning targets across the classes while differentiating for 

their students each week. 

  Teachers take ownership of the success of every student in the building. They are transparent about their 

data and student work. Teachers actively seek and share best practices with one another. 

  We have an open door policy and teachers move freely into one another’s classrooms. 
  Teachers participate in a weekly grade team meeting to unit plan and revise learning targets and lesson plans. 

They meeting formally for one hour per week and frequently meet informally during their common lunch, as 
well as before and after school. 

  Teachers participate in data analysis on some professional learning Mondays and during their common 

planning time on Tuesdays. They collectively look for trends using our Excel spreadsheets that track letter and 
letter sound identification and F&P independent reading levels for every student. Teachers also analyze 
student work and unit assessments in math to create groups and develop upcoming learning targets. 
Additionally, teachers use rubrics to score and analyze student On Demand writing samples across the grade 
every six weeks. 

  Teachers call one another by first name and have established personal relationships. We have a culture where 

everyone feels comfortable asking for help. 

  A recent staff survey indicated that 100% of teachers are committed to our mission and believe that grade 

 

team meetings improve their practice. 
School leadership uses a variety of data sources (observations, student work, surveys, research, conversations 
with families, teachers, and students) to design targeted professional learning sessions every week. 

NEEDS: 

  Although teachers participate in meaningful and student centered Grade Team Meetings, each meeting topic 

stands in isolation of school goals or priorities. 

We need to design a protocol and clear action steps from each meeting connected to our larger goals with built in 
opportunities for progress monitoring.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

STRENGTHS: 

 

 

Families are highly responsive to school events. We had over 80% of our families attend Back-to-School Night 
and 100% of our families attended their parent-teacher conference and our Stepping Ceremony. 
Families attend our weekly Community Meeting where students perform and participate in 
chants/cheers/plays connected to our core values. 

  We have a communication folder that goes between home and school each day. Both the school and families 

use it to communicate important happenings and news. 

  On every homework packet there is an “Ask Me About” section that gives families conversation starters about 

what their child is learning at school. 

  We have an open door policy and families are welcomed into classrooms. 
  We asked families for feedback about workshop topics they would be interested in and plan workshops based 

on their needs and wants. 
Families share important news with the school. 

 

 

NEEDS: 

  Although parents attend large events like our potluck, student performances, and curriculum night, we are 
interested in having parents more present throughout the school. We need to create systems to encourage 
more family participation in school (i.e. volunteers, guest readers, etc.) 

  We need to create more opportunities for families to build relationships with one another (potlucks, 

workshops, grade team coffees, etc.) 

  We need to increase student attendance overall. Our average was below 95% this year. Attendance impacts 

our student’s ability to meet rigorous academic and social goals. 

  We want to prioritize families whose children have attendance below 85%.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
● During teacher recruitment we cast a wide net. In addition to our Department of Education job posting, we reach 
out to a variety of organizations including various institutions of higher education and New York City Teaching 
Fellows. We believe that word of mouth is one of the most powerful tools to discover excellent talent and we 
encourage our team to talk about our school’s mission with other educators. 

● During our interview process, we seek out educators who first and foremost believe deeply in our mission and have 
a track record of working in high needs communities with strong results. A thorough background in the workshop 
model, guided reading instruction, collecting and analyzing data, experience using the Responsive Classroom 
approach, and an eagerness to learn new things are also important qualities in potential candidates. 

● With their permission, we invite candidates to conduct a sample lesson so that we may analyze their planning and 
observe their interactions with students. After the lesson, we ask candidates to reflect and offer feedback. 

● When planning our teacher assignments we consider the teacher’s background, experience, and areas of expertise 
and align that with the needs of our students. 

● Our weekly professional learning workshops are based on needs identified through our observation of teachers, 
analysis of student work, and feedback from teachers. 

● Teachers will participate in bi-weekly individualized coaching meetings with their instructional leader. There, 
instructional leaders provide targeted support based on the Danielson framework to each teacher. 

● We identify high quality out-of-school professional development opportunities that are relevant to our teachers 
based on the goals they develop in their coaching meetings. 

We have 100% teacher retention. We recruit and maintain high quality teachers by committing to their professional 
growth and development and by giving them a voice and leadership opportunities in our school. 

We build meaningful relationships with teachers and make a great effort to get to know them both professionally and 
personally.

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
● Our professional development is mapped out based on our frequent reflection and needs assessments and is 
aligned to our school’s mission. 

● Classroom observations, student data, conversations with families, innovative practices in other schools, teacher 
feedback, and our instructional focus all inform the design of our professional development calendar.  

● In addition to the formal workshops and training that we provide teachers each week, we believe that modeling is 
one of the most powerful tools to improve teacher and staff performance. School leaders model effective 
management and instruction both formally and informally throughout the day. 

● We encourage collaboration and have an open door policy. Teachers have opportunities for inter-visitation to learn 
best practices from their colleagues. 

● Teachers will participate in bi-weekly individualized coaching meetings with their instructional leader. There, 
instructional leaders provide targeted support based on the Danielson framework to each teacher. 

● School leaders guide teachers in analysis of student data like F&P running records and student work samples to 
guide planning. 

● School leaders support teachers in long term  

● CCSS aligned unit planning. 

● School leaders provide lesson plan feedback to all teachers. 

The principal improves her practice with partnership with a leadership coach from the Leadership Academy, by 
attending monthly professional development through the superintendent's office, participating in an inquiry team 
with principal colleagues, and attending our of school professional workshops related to our goals with Math in the 
City.

meetings to discuss assessments and areas for professional development. The principal has an open door policy and 
bi-weekly meetings with teachers to work collaboratively.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Jamaica Children’s School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Jamaica Children’s School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Jamaica Children's School uses the Fountas and Pinnell Tracking System to assess the reading skills of our ELL students.   These 
assessments are  administered  four times per year.  Additionally, every 6-8 weeks students are given the On Demand writing 
assessment from Teacher's College. We keep comprehensive records of the students’ reading level and early literacy skills like 
letter identification and phonemic awareness skills. We also use one-to-one conferencing in reading and writing to keep track 
of the student’s literacy progress and set goals. We analyze students' data in our weekly inquiry meetings to help us identify 
the literacy needs of our students.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Three days per week students participate in "half groups". During this time half of the class attends a special like music or art 
and half of the class stays in the homeroom for targeted small group reading instruction. Then, the two groups switch. This 
provides us with significant time to assess children independently and in small groups and adjust our instruction accordingly.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of the ELL program by monitoring the progress that the ELL students make each year.  The NYSESLAT 
offers insight on how they are progressing in each of the 4 modalities. Our teachers design lessons and teach learning 
strategies for students lagging behind in any of the language modalities. For example, a student that needs to move in 
Listening will receive additional coaching in that modality.  Classroom teachers are taught teaching strategies to help students 
build on the student’s comprehensible input.  Scaffolds are used to increase comprehensible input as a support mechanism in 
the various modalities. We use ongoing assessments like Fountas and Pinell to monitor students progress towards mastery of 
the Common Core standards. 
     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Three days per week students participate in "half groups". During this time half of the class attends a special like music or art 
and half of the class stays in the homeroom for targeted small group reading instruction. Then, the two groups switch. This 
provides us with significant time to assess children independently and in small groups and adjust our instruction accordingly.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use a variety of assessments, including Fountas and Pinnell Assessment and literacy skills assessments in order to group 
students based on individual needs.  With this information we determine which students may need Tier 2  and which students 
may need Tier 3 RtI.  These needs are reassessed each cycle to ensure progress and appropriate placement of students.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT data indicates that are students improved and increased their proficiency from last year. It also reveals that our 
new ELL students have emerging and expanding skills in the English language based on the NYSITELL data. Our students need 
the most support in writing and speaking. We are working to help students develop their speaking skills in their home 
language as well as English to support their literacy skills.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During some of our Monday Professional Learning time we analyze student data, including the data of our ELLs, to revise 
curriculum and plan for differentiated instruction. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

As we have a small ELL population this year, students remain with their homeroom and receive push-in services. They 
are grouped heterogeneously within their homeroom and we use an integrated model.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              The push-in model is implemented this year.  However, as our population grows, ELLs in different grade levels must be 
grouped  (first/second-grade and fourth/fifth) in order for the mandated number of instructional periods/minutes to be met. 
Our ELLs who are beginners and intermediate level will receive 360 minutes of service while our advanced students will 
receive 180 minutes. Native Language support will be provided through the procurement of native language libraries 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      For the primary grades, decoding skills are developed using explicit and intensive instruction in phonological awareness and 
phonics.  As our ELLs progress throughout the grades, challenging texts will be utilized to teach comprehension 
strategies.  Academic language is vital to classroom discourse.  It is essential for teachers to engage in structured, academic 
talk by focusing on critical vocabulary. We use the Foundation, as well as, the Language standards as a basis for supporting our 
ELLs. Also, teachers work with ELLs in small groups to target deficiencies during the regular school day, as well as during 
extended day.  Literature-based materials—including library books—a listening center with books on CD/tape , photo 
dictionaries are some of the materials used.   
  
Teachers use scaffolds for learning such as visuals and text at all levels to support students’ understanding of content.  Charts 
and graphic organizers enable students to understand information in manageable chunks and make concepts more 
comprehensible. Technology (CDs and various websites on the Internet) is also a part of daily teaching.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      ELLs enrolled are not evaluated in their native languages throughout the school year.  The teacher administers to Spanish-
speaking students the Spanish LAB when they enter the country for the first time in order to determine language dominance. 
This assessment is only available in Spanish. However, the teachers highly recommend to parents that students retain their 
home languages through practice at home.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 Newcomers receive intensive support and are assigned a “buddy”.  If there are classmates or teachers  who speak the same 
language as our newcomers, they are partnered with the ELL student for further support.  The ESL Teacher differentiates 
instruction which corresponds to students’ proficiency levels.  Visuals, realia, CDs/books on tape, and TPR (Total Physical 
Response) are some of the ESL methods employed.  Additionally, all ELL students have an Imagine Learning account which 
combines instruction in their native language with English. The Fundations reading program is implemented in all Kindergarten 
classes.  ELS receiving more than three years of service attend the extended day program.  Peer tutoring, differentiated 
instruction, and small group instruction is implemented There are presently no SIFE students.  The plans for SIFEs would 
include differentiated instruction, extended day instruction, and participation in summer school.  
Differentiated instruction for ELL subgroups 
a.     There are no SIFE students at our school. We are Pre-k to 2nd grade school.   
b.     Newcomer ELLs (0-3 years of service) are generally in the Beginner or Intermediate group. 
c.     N/A 
d.     There are no Long terms ELLs in the school. We are Pre-K –Second grade school.  
 e.         N/A

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In order to ensure that ELL-SWDs receive all required ENL minutes and additional services in the least restrictive environment 
the service providers meet at the beginning of the school year with copies of the students’ IEPs to discuss the scheduling of 
students who receive multiple services.  This ensures that there is no overlap in scheduling and that students are served in the 
least restrictive environment.  The curriculum and instruction in all classes is informed by student IEPs, as all teachers have 
access to the IEPs through SESIS or hard copy.  Assessments throughout the year are given with appropriate testing 
modifications.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to ensure that ELL-SWDs receive all required ENL minutes and additional services in the least restrictive environment 
the service providers meet at the beginning of the school year with copies of the students’ IEPs to discuss the scheduling of 
students who receive multiple services.  This ensures that there is no overlap in scheduling and that students are served in the 
least restrictive environment.  The curriculum and instruction in all classes is informed by student IEPs, as all teachers have 
access to the IEPs through SESIS or hard copy.  Assessments throughout the year are given with appropriate testing 
modifications.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We are using Benchmark assessments to identify students needing targeted intervention programs.  This program is currently 
offered in English.  Using the results of this assessment we group students into tier I, tier II, or tier III intervention 
services.  These services are provided in English.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

No programs for ELLs will be discontinued.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time, no programs will be discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are invited to all school programs and they are provided appropriate support as needed.  This year there is no after school 
available at our school.  We try to recommend to parents other neighborhood agencies that can support the children.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All of our classrooms have leveled libraries, EnoBoards,  ipads, laptops, and document readers. Literature-based materials—
including library books—a listening center with audio books, and photo dictionaries are some of the materials used.  There is 
an abundant supply of multicultural books within our growing library. We have procured English, Spanish, and Bengali 
materials.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is offered to Spanish-speaking students from the ENL teachers and other bilingual school staff. This 
support usually consists of discussions of class-content and the directions for assignments.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Newly enrolled students are supported with appropriate instruction and support of the family through parent-teacher 
meetings and workshops. We have a "buddy" system to support our new students. Families are invited to visit and tour the 
school. Throughout the year, focused meeting around language strategies will be provided to parents. Information is also

backpacked to ensure that parents are aware of the instructional expectations. We will also translate written information as 
necessary. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All of our classrooms have leveled libraries, EnoBoards,  ipads, laptops, and document readers. Literature-based materials—
including library books—a listening center with audio books, and photo dictionaries are some of the materials used.  There is 
an abundant supply of multicultural books within our growing library. We have procured English, Spanish, and Bengali 
materials.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our office staff, principal, and social worker all work together to welcome new families entering our community. Parents are 
invited to observe in classrooms, meeting one-on-one with teachers, and receive a welcome packet with information about 
programs and opportunities at our school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff development takes place on an ongoing basis.  General Education staff, as well as ENL staff members, receive training 
throughout the academic year. Professional development takes place in and outside the school. Staff memebers will attend 
professional development opportunities offered by the Borough Field Support Office.  For in-house training, the focus is on 
methodologies that can be implemented on a daily basis that support the language development of all students as well as 
strategies for differentiation.   
In house professional development focused on strategies for meaningful differentiation that supports our ELLS happens 
several times a year during our Monday professional learning time.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As an early childhood school, this does not yet apply to us.  
We create a long term professional development calendar and ensure that we are meeting the requirements. We have a 
binder that includes all professional learning agendas and supporting materials.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher schedules an annual meeting in the spring with all parents of ELLs to discuss their progress and share 
materials that they can use to support their child's learning at home.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

PTA meetings are held once a month.  The parents and families of our ELL students have several opportunities to become 
familiar with all programs that the New York City Department of Education offers.  There is a parent orientation at the 
beginning of the school year for parents/guardians of new ELLs, and parent workshops are scheduled during the year to assist 
parents to participate in their child’s education.   Translated materials are distributed to students and parents in their native 
languages.  Parents of ELLS are encouraged to attend meetings scheduled to inform parents of school events and policies so 
that they may be involved in the decision-making process.  Interpreters are available for all teacher/parent meetings.  Oral 
translations are provided by the DOE Office of Translation and Interpretation Unit and by parent volunteers and school 
personnel, when appropriate and available.  Written translations, as made available by the DOE and where necessary by 
parent volunteers, are provided.    Parents are informed of the availability of translation services and given a request form to 
complete if these services are needed.  The staff works with the Parent Coordinator to address the needs of all our parents.   
  
Parent orientation is offered at the beginning of the school year to inform parents about the different programs and 
resources.  In addition, parents are encouraged to volunteer and participate in classrooms.  
Parent letters, newsletters and calendars are sent  to NYC Department of Education for translation or we provide in-house 
translations.  Bilingual teacher conducts conferences in Spanish..   
The following activities are available for parents to participate:   
   -Parent orientation of newly enrolled ELLs 
   -Monthly PTA meetings 
   -Community Meeting 
   -Curriculum Night 
   -Monthly School Leadership Team Meeting

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Suzanne Wasik, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Each incoming family completes the Home Language Identification Survey. From the survey and conversation with 
families we are able to determine the language spoken at home. Once that is determined we interview the family 
with follow up questions with regard to their preferences for communication. If we have a staff member who also 
speaks the home language, they serve as a translator. If we do not have an available translator on site, we contact 
the Language Line to reach someone via phone who can offer translation in the native language. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

The notification requirements are available in our main office. If a family requires translation we follow the steps 
mentioned above. Additionally, we have our school brochure and fliers printed in multiple languages.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?
