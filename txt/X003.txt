Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

 

School Mission 

The mission of P.S./M.S. 3 is to foster a community of learners that promotes high standards and achievable outcomes

responsibility. 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS/MS 3  Raul  Julia Micro Society  is  an  elementary-middle  school with 340 students  from  pre-kindergarten  through 
Grade 8. The school population comprises 30% Black, 68% Hispanic, and 2% Asian students. . Boys account for 50% of 
the students enrolled and girls account for 50%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017 - 2018 was 93%. 
 
We see our school as a community of lifelong learners where decisions at every level are made by putting children’s 
needs and interests first. All members in our learning community, staff, parents and students, will take responsibility 
and share accountability for insuring a well-balanced, rigorous curriculum and a school culture that promotes personal 
responsibility for the collective benefit. Our goal is to collaborate in creating school wide educational initiatives that 
support critical thinking, creativity and problem solving strategies. Mastering those strategies will prepare our students 
to become independent problem solvers, inspired team players and empowered to give back to society. In addition, 
high expectations are communicated clearly and consistently to the school in the following ways: 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

Family  Night  parents  meet  all  their  child’s  teachers  and  learn  about  the  curriculum  and  the  rigorous 
expectations for each subject area and grade. Teachers communicate expectations connected to college and 
career readiness. 

  Parent  workshops  are  conducted  by  various  members  of  the  school  community  and  guest  speakers  in 
conjunction  with  the  Parent  Association  on  the  following,  but  are  not  limited  to:  Common  Core  Learning 
Standards,  ELA  and  Math  Standardized  Testing,  ELA  and  Math  Shifts,  Reading  Aloud  to  Children,  Gang 
Awareness and Nutrition. 

  Annual High School Fair takes place during the month of October, we host a high school fair that is attended by 
our grade 7 and 8 students and parents.In attendance are public, private and parochial schools.Students and 
parents  have  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  various  high  school  representatives  to  become  more 
knowledgeable about their programs and initiatives. 

  Teachers, the dean, the guidance counselor and the administrators reach out to parents via phone calls, emails, 
and meetings to ensure that lines of communication are open to support student progress. Teacher teams are 
made available to parents for meetings as needed facilitated by teacher and an assistant principal on Monday 
afternoons during our Family Engagement. 

  Progress Reports are sent to parents on a weekly or biweekly basis to alert parents of concerns in academic 

 

subject areas and/ or behavior. 
School  leaders,  Literacy  and  Math  consultants  provide  focused  professional  support  and  professional  on 
Tuesdays, during conference days, faculty conferences, grade and department meetings resulting in collegial 
learning and a culture of mutual accountability. 

We are successfully working with consultants through Accelerated Literacy Learning, Generation Ready (Mathematics) 
and with Algebra for All. With the expertise of the consultants we are able to provide ongoing professional learning and 
support  to  teachers  and  administrators.  They  are  assisting  us  with  our  instructional  focus:  Student  Engagement. 
Furthermore, they are guiding teachers (through planning and modeling) in through the development of standard based 
lessons that are aligned to the Danielson’s Framework that engage our students in rigorous and differentiated academic 
work.collegial learning and a culture of mutual accountability. 
 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The special population on which we focus is our students with disabilities. 

  We have structured our Special Education Teacher Support Services program to meet the varied needs of our 

students in grades K-8 as follows: 

  We employ a push-in model to better support students in all content areas. 
  The Integrated Collaborative Team Teaching classes are structured to maximize student learning by: having 

content specialist in each content area, teachers have common planning time, the general education teacher 
and the special education teacher are truly co-facilitating and the IEP Team truly works as a collaborative 
team with the student’s best interest being the main focus. 

  

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school has several strengths, which were highlighted in our Quality Review. They are as follows: 
 
The school’s curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and refined using student work and data to 
meet the needs of all learners, thereby promoting a path to college and career. 
 
The school leverages resources, staff time, teacher assignments and student programming aligned with school goals to 
improve teacher pedagogy and increase student achievement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

The administration and the teachers plan curricula to make purposeful decisions to support college and career 
readiness.  

We are departmentalized in all core content areas in grades 1 through 8.  

We have adopted Expeditionary Learning for grades 3 through 8 and Fundations for kindergarten through grade 2. 
This purposeful decision provides all with coherent curriculum across the school. 

For Math, the school has adopted Go Math! for grades Kindergarten through 8. This is best for our students because 
it provides them with a coherence in vocabulary, terms , and the implementation of the instructional shifts found in 
the Common Core. Through the Go Math! curriculum, students are provided with essential questions, vocabulary, 
daily routines, and a problem of the day. The students are able to engage, explore, explain, elaborate, evaluate and 
problem solve.  

The school implements the New York city Social Studies and Science Scope and Sequence content standards. Lesson 
plans include an agreed upon set of components not limited to the teaching point, Common Core/Content Standard, 
connection, teaching, guided practice, link, independent practice differentiated instruction, share, assessment and 
homework. The lessons are planned to provide access for all learners, including pre-planned data based grouping.  

The writing units for grades 1 through 8 are planned yearlong for all grades using a common calendar of scope and 
sequence. During the implantation of the units, student-friendly rubrics and graphic organizers are provided to the 
students. Additionally, teachers have unit plans and modules that include an overview, essential questions, and key 
ideas. 

Needs: 

Teacher observation feedback reflects the need to work with teachers to better develop skill and strategy objectives 
that aligned with the assessed students’ needs. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

By June 2019, the New York State English Language Arts test results of a target population in grades 4-8, who 
scored a Level 2 on the 2018 state exam, will improve their scale score range by 60 points.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In reviewing the pertinent data for student performance, teacher performance, the Quality Review and the School 
Quality Snapshot, the priority for our work in this section is to develop coherent cycles of Professional Learning that 
focus on deeply engaging students in instruction. This type of high-quality teaching is strongly correlated to high levels 
of student achievement. The evidence used to make this decision includes, but is not limited to the following: 

  Our  school  made  progress  by  an  average  of  7.5%  when  comparing  the  NYS  ELA  and  NYS  Mathematics 
Examination results for 2014 versus 2015. In addition, PS/MS outperformed approximately 70% of all District 
10 schools and 50% of all NYC schools in ELA and Mathematics achievement. However, despites this progress 
and relative  performance, only 18% of our students are at least  proficient in ELA and only 26% are at least 
proficient in Mathematics. 

  The analysis of Advance data indicates that while our teachers performed relatively well in Danielson Domains 
1, 2 and 4, there was a preponderance of evidence that suggests that Domain 3 was an area which requires 
additional support and professional learning. Specifically, there was a high incidence of Developing ratings in 
Danielson’s 3c (Engaging Students in Learning) and 3d (Using Assessment in Instruction). 

  The most recent results of the Quality Review for PS/MS 3 suggests our school excels in aligning the curricula 
to the CCLS, leverages our resources for student achievement, and has developed a safe, nurturing environment 
for student and staff growth. However, it also indicates a need for improvement in the areas of building teacher 
capacity and creating common assessments that better address student learning needs. 

  Our School Quality Snapshot indicates a high level of student progress on the NYS ELA and Mathematics test 
for All Students. Meanwhile, a closer examination of this document reveals less progress from our ELL’s, SWD’s 
and  Lowest  Performing  Student  groups.  Additionally,  it  highlights  a  need  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of 
teaching and learning at PS/MS 3.  

An aggregate of the aforementioned evidence led us to decide that our Professional Learning Cycles should be focused 
on the collaborative planning of standards-based lessons through lesson study. These lessons will include multiple entry 
points and differentiation to address the various learning needs of the class population. Moreover, the teachers will 
develop common assessments in order to norm student data in an effort to further inform curricula adjustments and 
the practice of effective lesson planning. The desired result of this work will be a higher level of student engagement in 
instruction and an increase in teacher and student performance.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

engagement and Danielson. 

During Professional Learning sessions there will be specific efforts 
to  address  strategies  for  high-need  student  subgroups.  In  our 
lesson studies we will discuss the concepts of multiple entry points 
and  differentiated  instruction.  We  will  use  assessment  data  to 
inform 
instructional  practices.  The 
combination  of  these  strategies  will  lead  high  levels  of  student 
engagement.

Students will be encouraged to demonstrate character traits that 
improve  academic  achievement  and 
social  well-being. 
Additionally,  they  will  be  exposed  to  the  concept  of  a  ‘Growth 
Mind-set’. The morning announcements, assembly programs and 
the infusion of these ideas into daily teaching practices will be the 
main vehicle to accomplish this initiative. 

Teachers  will  reach  out  to  parents  weekly  to  improve  the 
achievement of students. Progress reports, report cards and other 
data  will  be  sent  home  to  keep  parents  updated  about  student 
progress.  The  Parent  Coordinator  will  facilitate  workshops  for 
parents with regard to the Common Core and strategies to use at 
home to support classroom teaching.

Select parents will take part in Learning Walks in order for them to 
see the school curriculum and other initiatives in progress. 

Parents 

The Parent Coordinator will facilitate monthly workshops in 
concert with the Parent Academy at Mercy College. 

Parents 

The Parent Coordinator will organize a minimum of one workshop 
for  parents  every  month  that  is  geared  toward  making  our 
students’  parents  aware  of  what  is  expected  at  school,  the 
curriculum and initiatives in place at our school, the Common Core 
Learning Standards, and other social emotional topics. 

The workshops will also focus on providing our students’ parents 
with practical strategies that they can employ at home with their 
children  to  help  them  become  proficient 
in  Literacy  and 
Mathematics.  

Another way that our parents will play an active role in our school 
is through the School Leadership Team (SLT). Our SLT has at least 
10 members, with 5 of the members consisting of parents and 5 
Department of Education staff members. Parents on the SLT will 
participate  in  many  of  the  decisions  that  affect  their  children 
academically.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

At P.S. /M.S. 3 we are committed hiring and retaining certified teachers for school wide program. Through an aggressive 
recruitment process we seek teachers certified through the conventional process as well as through the New York City 
Fellows  Program  and  Teach  for  America.  We  are  proactive  in  attracting  and  recruiting  highly  qualified  teachers. 
Specifically formed personnel teams attend all appropriate job fairs, especially those for new teaching fellows and newly 
certified teachers. 

All of our teachers are certified and licensed in the area in which they are teaching. Once teachers are hired we pair 
them  with  a  mentor  (master  teachers)  for  their  first  year.  Throughout  their  first  year,  new  teachers  are  offered 
differentiated professional development and they work with the Generation Ready consultant and Accelerated Literacy 
Learning consultants.  
 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Professional  development  is  the  core  to  our  school’s  improvement  plan.  We  offer  many  professional  development 
opportunities,  and  have  contracted  experienced  instructional  support  consultants  in  the  areas of  Mathematics and 
Literacy to work with our staff.  

The instructional support personnel is available to assist all staff members with instructional and curriculum issues on-
site and off-site. In addition, teachers are encouraged to participate in off-site professional development to increase 
their knowledge and skill set. Professional development takes place every Wednesday for all staff members. 

Grade wide and department planning team meetings will be held during preparation periods on Tuesdays. The meetings 
are facilitated by the consultants or a teacher. Supervisor(s) will also be in attendance at the meetings.

intervention services, etc.). 
Being  a  Pre-Kindergarten  to  8  school  we  are  able  to  provide  a  smooth  to  our  kindergarten  program.  The  Pre-
kindergarten session is in operation a full school year from 8:00 AM-2:20 PM. The pre-kindergarten schedule mirrors 
the kindergartens schedule. The Pre-kindergarten Literacy program is Splash Into Pre-K (similar to the Journeys program 
used  in  grades  K  to  2  for  Literacy).  This  program  is  aligned  to  the  Common  Core  Learning  Standards.  The  Pre-
kindergarten Math program is Every Day Mathematics. We have developed a pacing calendar for this program and we 
have  aligned  the  units  to  the  Common  Core  Learning  Standards.  In  addition,  the  students  participate  in  centers  to 
promote  their  cognitive  development  and  social  development.  The  pre-kindergarten  teacher  participates  in  all  the 
school-wide professional development and one on one consultations facilitated by our Literacy and Math consultants 
and network support people. 
 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teacher representatives for the school community are going to be selected annually to identify Measures of Student 
Learning. We will focus on the following questions supplied by the Department of Education: 

  What assessments and target populations do we want to use? 
  What will we do for growth measurements? 

 

For both decisions, consider: 

How much time will this take?  

Do we want to invest this time fin light of the other critical work in our school? 

How does this decision build upon or change the current practices in our school? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

 

The committee will use a six step process, with 1 hour allotted for each step. The steps are as follows: 

  Discuss important NYC Department of Education introductory information. 
  Review the assessment options. 
 
  Review the growth measurements. 

Finalize the assessment selection. 

Present the recommended approach to the principal. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to

combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational  research  shows  a  positive  correlation  between  effective  parental  involvement  and  student 
achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective 
involvement of parents and community in the school. PS/MS 3, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part  A  of  the  Every  Student  Succeeds  Act  (ESSA),  is  responsible  for  creating  and  implementing  a  parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on 
the  School  Leadership  Team,  Parent  Association,  and  Title  I  Parent  Committee  as  trained  volunteers  and 
welcomed members of the school community.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The  school’s  Parent  Involvement  Policy  was  designed  based  upon  a  careful  assessment  of  the  needs  of  all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language  Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through 
school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, 
and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

PS/MS 3 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before November 27th of each school year to 
advise parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), 
their right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, 
Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Professional learning is the core to our school’s improvement plan.  We offer many professional 
development opportunities, and have experienced instructional support personnel who have 
successfully taught and implemented all programs and initiatives at P.S./M.S. 3.  The 
instructional support personnel is available to assist all staff members with instructional and 
curriculum issues.  In addition, teachers are encouraged to participate in off site professional 
development to increase their knowledge and skill set.   
Grade wide planning meetings are held during preparation and all teachers participate in 
professional development every Tuesday.   
The role of the Professional Development Team is to facilitate and provide professional 
development workshops for all staff members.  In addition, members of the Professional 
Development Team are responsible for arranging classroom inter-visitations, visits to other 
school sites, workshops on-site and off-site, demonstration lessons and team teaching.   
The ESL teacher and content regular classroom teachers will continue to attend professional 
development sessions sponsored by Accelerated Literacy Learning which will be turn-keyed to 
other staff members as well.   The teachers will collaborate with each other to design ESL 
friendly lessons that will also benefit all students.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS/MS 3 uses DRA (Kindergarten-3), the Performance Series (3-8) and Fountas and Pinnell for reading level correlations.  The 
ENL teacher also uses thematic units of study.  At the end of every unit, the students are assessed and are grouped by 
language proficiency levels.  The teacher makes in class observations and creates differentiated assessments based on a 
performance task.

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At PS/MS 3 the success of the English Language Learner Program is measured by how well the students perform on the 
NYSESLAT and of other performance assessments.  Growth can also be measured by the transition from one proficiency level 
to the next and performance levels on the New York State exams.  In additon to meeting our annual yearly progress for English 
Language Learners is another way to gauge the success of our program.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At PS/MS 3 data is used to determine what services should be provided to each student.  Using Response to Intervention 
ensures that English Language Learners  are given the opportunity to be engaged in rigorous instruction.  Instead, of being 
referred erroneously.  Basically, this model is used to build on standard core curriculum already in place in classrooms.  It 
provided intervention through a Three Tiered System.  The levels of support can be altered based on the individual needs of 
each ELL student.  Through observation, evaluation and assessment, students individual growth is closely monitored.  This 
framework gives ELLs who are below grade level a chance to receive instruction in a risk free environment.  Again,  student 
growth is closely monitoered and determining on the level of performance students may or may not be discontiued.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data reveals that PS/MS 3 has 5 students Entering, 3 students Emerging,  9 students Transitioning and 17 students 
Expanding.  As students transiton from one grade to another, they generally move up a proficiency level or remain on the 
same level.  Benchmarks across the modalities affects instructional decisions made by the ENL teacher and the scores are 
discussed with other staff members servicing these students.  Teachers will nodify their lessons to meet the needs of the ELL 
students across the modalities and provide more focused instruction.   
According to the most recent English Langauge arts Exam 0% of ELLs reached a proficiency level of 3 and 4.  However, 11.1% of 
our ELLs reached a proficiency level of 3 and 4 on the Mathematics State exam.   
The ELL students at PS/MS 3 are closely monitored and are provided with ENL services as per the New York States CR Part 154 
mandates.  English Language Learners who are Entering and emerging are provided with 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction.  English Language Learners that are Transitioning and Expanding are provided with 180 minutes of ENL 
instruction.  The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher groups students according to their language proficiency levels and 
their reading levels.  The ENL teacher creates lessons that focus on the four language modalities of Listening, Speaking, 
Reading and  Writing.  Furthermore, a vast array of teaching materials  to compliment the different learning styles.  As a result 
of ELL students not performing as well on the NYS English Language Arts exam, there will be a greater focus on Reading and 
Writing.  Students will be provided with additonal scaffolds that will target literacy and writing instuction, in addition to 
reading and writing strategies.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 ELL Programming PS/MS 3 adheres to the mandated requirements that ELLs who score at the entering and emerging 
levels on the 
 NYSESLAT will receive 360 minutes of ENL services per week.  ELLs who score at the transitioning level on the 
NYSESLAT will  
receive 180 minutes of ENL service per week.    
  
ENL instruction will be provided by the ENL teacher through a push-in model primarily and pull-out model when 
needed.  In this  
model the ENL teacher will serve in the capacity of a co-teacher and supports the ELL students with direct instruction 
in the classroom 
 setting.  Some students who require 360 minutes will receive additional service at times through a pull-out 
model.   Students are 
 grouped by proficiency levels when possible.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              When designing the ENL schedule, we ensure that we are providing the mandated amout of service as per CR Part 
154.  The flexibility  in scheduling affords the ENL teacher the opportunity to organize groups based on proficiency levels.  The 
ENL teacher meets with the classroom teacher to develop a schedule that best meets the needs of the ELLs in the class.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
       ENL instruction is delivered through the content areas with a specific emphasis  on Literacy, Writing and 
Mathematics.  Although the main language used for instruction is English, Spanish as well as other languages will be used as 
necessary through teacher  translation or interpretation  and/or a student who is dominate in the specific language will be 
asked to assist.  Furthermore,  glossary, picture dictionary, thesaures, picture card,  bilingual dictionary will be used to support 
the native language as well.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?

Students who are SIFE are provided with additional services. Parents are interviewed at registration to further assist the school 
with 
 information pertinent to the child’s educational background ensuring proper class placement. When students arrive at our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

school, 
 they are given an informal assessment. Students are assessed in their classrooms and are provided with the opportunity to 
work  
in homogeneous groups.   At times, SIFE students are paired with another student of the same country in order to provide 
them with  
additional support. The students are reintroduced to a school setting. Students and parents are also given the opportunity to 
meet  
with a guidance counselor, the dean and the teacher. Staff members are also made aware of these students and are provided 
with 
 best practices, activities and training that can further facilitate and support them. These students are also monitored inorder 
to  
organize a plan that would hone in on the their weaknesses and strengths. In addition, they are provided with the same 
educational 
 materials as all the other ELLs.  
  
The plan for newly arrived ELLs includes, but is not limited to a parent workshop or individual conference for the selection of a  
program that best meets the needs of the ELLs and their parents. Once our ELLs are identified and placed in their program 
selection, 
 they are then provided with the services of English as a New Language using the push-in and/or pull-out models. In addition, 
our 
 ELLs are provided with a class partner, Academic Iintervention Services, and scaffolding. 
  
In order to address the No Child Left Behind policy, student’s progress is tracked and monitored as these children will be 
required to  
take the ELA after one year. To ensure students are prepared, the ENL teacher provides these students with two ENL units 
with  
intense focus on language acquisition.  In addition, these children also receive ELA instructiom during the school day.   
  
Students receiving 4 to 6 years of English as a New Language are also monitored in order to provide them with tailored 
instruction 
 based on the results of the NYSESLAT modalities, ELA State exam, teacher assessments, class work and homework. 
Afterwards, the 
 students are provided with services according to their individual needs. These services usually include academic intervention.  
 Additionally, ELLs who have reached a proficiency level on the NYSESLAT will be provided with two years of transitional 
support 
 through testing accomodations and special programs offered after school. 
  
Long term ELLs are provided with all mandated services and safety nets such as AIS support in Literacy and Math, and  
individualized or small group instruction.   Their progress is closely monitored to ensure that they receive the necessary 
services. 
 Teachers provide students with meaningful feedback on their work and allow students the opportunity to self assess and set  
educational goals for themselves. In addition to the commom core learning standards, teachers provide exemplars so students 
can 
 have models. Students are also trained on different rubrics for the various writing genres.  
  
The plan to support ELLs who pass the NYSESLAT is to continue to provide them a per mandate, with additional 2 years of 
support 
for additional testing accomadations, small group instruction and access to the ESL resources if needed. In order to provide 
ELLs who 
 have passed the NYSESLAT with transitional support, the children will be tracked and monitored. In doing so, support will be 
 provided in the subject areas as needed per individual students. In order to determine what supports are needed, various

assessments will be utilized including State exam results. Title III will also be offered to these students as well as testing  
accomodations.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Some of the instructional strategies teachers use for ELL-SWDs include, but are not limited to: multisensory approach, 
modeling 
 every activity, using mnemonic strategies to prmote memory association, direct instruction, pacing instruction carefully thus 
ensuring 
 clarity, presenting technical content in small incremental steps, writing legibly with focused text, using props to present 
narrative 
 situations, using highlighters and underlining key words, using word frames, visual cues, outlining texts with a focus on the 
main idea, 
 and using various forms of assessments.  
The materials used to provide instruction varies. Some materials include, but are not limited to:  foam, raised and magnetic 
letters 
 and numbers, dry erase boards, counters, beads, making word cards and other hands-on and teacher created activities. Grade 
 appropriate materials are used to develop a word center.  In order to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least 
 restrictive environment, the school has scheduled support periods within some teachers' programs. Some teachers provide 
math 
 support and small group instruction and other teachers provide literacy support or small group instruction. These 
providers  work 
 closely with the classroom teachers in order to intergrate the class curricula with the instruction provided. The children 
chosen for 
 small group instruction are usually identified by the classroom teachers, school administrators, exam history or are IEP driven.  
Furthermore, ELLs who are classified with learning disabilites are served as per their IEP and receive multiple services.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teachers must meet State certification licensing requirements. The teachers are licensed in the area in which they teach. The 
staff is provided with many opportunities for professional development on various topics that address the needs of the ELLs 
both in the mainstream and special education.  Professional learning will take place during grade meetings, common preps, 
professional development, lunch time collaboration meetings and afterschool. All staff will participate in these workshops. The 
topics covered for professional development are, but not limited to: 
  
Who are our ELLs and how are ELLs identified-HLIS/LAB-R/NYSITELL?  
Lesson planning and correlation with the standards and performance indicators  
• Examining the language proficiency levels, language progressions and developing sample lessons  
• What is the NYSESLAT?  
• Tailoring lessons in the content areas to further meet the needs of ELLs  
• Examining the four language modalities Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing and creating activities and teaching 
strategies for each modality  
• Differentiated Instruction  
• Addressing the Learning Styles  
Implementing CharlotteDanielson's- A Framework for Teaching

development with an emphasis on test taking strategies and thematic units. T 
Refer to Question 1  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All students have transitional meeting with the guidance counselor. 
Teacher will participate in off site professional learning  and some on site professional learning in order to fulfill these 
requirements.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At PS/MS 3, developing a strong bond between the home and school community is essential for academic success. When 
parents are involved in their childs' education, children become more enthusiastic as well.  At present, there is a Paren Teacher 
Association which meets once a month. Parents elect their own cabinet members: President,  Treasurer and Secretary. The 
Parent's Association collect annual membership dues and promote and execute fund raisers. The PTA funds various school 
activities, including but not limited to, kindergarten and grade 8 graduations, field day and appreciation luncheon. ELL parents 
are welcomed and encouraged to attend these meetings.  ELL parents are provided with interpretors which facilitate 
communication in the parents native language. The PTA , Parent Coordintor and the school provide workshops for parents on 
all area.   
  
In addition parents are also inolved in the School Leadership meetings. During this meeting, the parents association president 
and elected parents meet with the Principal, elected teachers and the UFT representative as per Chancellor's Regulation A-
655.  
Parents needs are evaluated through parent surveys, parent-teacher conferences and individual meetings.  A parent bulletin 
board has been set up to display the upcoming school events, news, reminders, lunch menus, workshops and monthly 
calendars. In addition, parents will be offered special training on the NYC School Account and how to help their child at home. 
  
In order to further foster communication, parents will also be provided with their childs teacher's DOE email address. 
Furthermore, the PS/MS 3  website also provides parents with a variety of schoolwide information. The Parent Coordinator 
also sends out e-mails and makes phone calls to parents informing them about upcoming events and workshops. The Parent 
Coordinator also addresses personal parent isssues, concerns and questions. Once a year the parents are encouraged to fill out 
The Learning Environmental Survey. The results are discussed in order to implement change at the school based on the 
feedback from the parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Denise Brown, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

According to the RHLA we have concluded that our school services three major language groups. These include 
Spanish and French-Creole. We have teachers, school aides, paraprofessionals and the parent coordinator to 
facilitate the day to day translations on a needs basis. All communications sent to parents are in the language that 
the parent has requested. We make an effort to send home communications to the Non-English parents in their 
preferred language. Our school also utilizes the service of the DOE Translation Unit.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
