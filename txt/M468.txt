Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5 

 

the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4) 
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 
 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: Renewal School Narrative 

 

In a brief narrative, describe the current state of the Renewal school addressing the following:  

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

partners in furthering student achievement  

5.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the 

Framework for Great Schools and indicate where this has been a challenge. 

6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 

The High School for Health Careers and Sciences is a comprehensive educational program with a mission to promote 
college and career-readiness, community-based partnerships and a rigorous/diverse science program. We serve a 
diverse body of students across all five boroughs with a majority of our students coming from district six. Our school 
register is 427 students. Our student population characteristics are comprised of 81.03% Hispanic; 14.99% African 
American and 3.98% other. Currently, 40.98% of our total population of students are English Language Learners (of 
these, 18% are Entering, 20.1% are Emerging, 28.3% are Transitioning and 33.5% are Expanding); 31.2% of these 
students are SIFE; 18.5% of our population are students with an Individual Education Plan and of these, 15.9% receive 
SETTS supports. For our students we provide Push-In ELL supports as well as Integrated Co-Teaching classes for our 
Students with IEPs. Also, we provide after-school tutoring and a Saturday Academy to provide tutoring and 
Enrichment programs to service these students. 

 

To support teaching and learning, we have developed supportive structures in two principle areas: (1) a professional 
growth system supporting the implementation of a common core curriculum, and, (2) a system for measuring the 
impact of that provision relative to student learning and achievement. These structures support Rigorous Instruction, 
one part of the Framework for Great Schools. This ties to our school's priority which is to build teacher facility to 
analyze formative and summative assessment data in order to develop differentiated curriculum and instruction to 
improve Regents performance outcomes. 

 

Our schools’ instructional focus is to engage students in high quality Common Core aligned, collaborative, text-based 
discussions and writing tasks as a means to access, process, deepen and demonstrate their content and concept 
understandings within and across subject areas. We believe that students learn best when learning is socialized and 
collaborative. As a result, administrative policies, instructional practices, and curricular provisions aim to support our 
instructional focus and Danielson components 1e, 3b, 3c, and 3d. We feel these to be high leverage components in 
transforming teaching culture. They speak to intentionality in design and focus attention on the direct relationship 
between the types of questions we ask, along with the kinds of thinking these questions provoke. 

 

We have many partnerships which strengthen our goals and the overall school program. These include: 

  Our lead partner, Catholic Charities, which supports: college-readiness, advisory, social/emotional support 

services, academic intervention services, SAT prep, mentoring, transitioning, parent engagement, STEM, 
experiential learning & Life Skills. 

  A collaboration with Community School Board Twelve focusing on our student government representatives 

who attend monthly board meetings  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

  A partnership with the Manhattan Borough President's Office to support the implementation of the Career 

and Technical Education program by providing grant opportunities 

  A partnership with the Office of Career and Technical Education to provide training for the staff and 

administration as well as materials necessary to launch the program 

  A collaboration with the Center for Supportive Schools' Peer Group Connection to support the social and 

emotional needs of our students. 

  Partnership at Isabella Geriatric Center for students to visit the institution and learn of the opportunities 

available to students should they choose this career path 

  Cornell University collaboration, offering a Hydroponics and Aquaponics course 
 

Student Government Activities: theme dances, spirit days, bake sales, attendance at community board 
meetings 

 

 

Our school has an active student government that includes all grade groupings. This group of students is heavily 
involved in the organization of activities in the school: school dances, school bake sales, school service projects, etc. 
Our student government has regular meetings to include and inform student representatives of school policies. 
Additionally, there are monthly Town Hall meetings for each grade level to celebrate student success regarding 
academic progress toward graduation, perfect attendance, the most improved students and so forth. This is used as a 
vehicle to improve student academic success/participation and allows students to have a voice. We have a significant 
number of clubs, extracurricular activities and college readiness programs. These include: Game Club, Film Club and 
the Musical Production Club. Student achievement is posted around the school – perfect attendance, Principal’s 
honor roll, high honor roll, passing Regents/classes, etc. We offer the credit accumulation programs, Regents 
prep/tutoring and other academic interventions to support at-risk students. The school implements credit 
accumulation programs during the school year and employs winter and spring breaks for state-approved online credit 
accumulation programs. 

 

A strength is that we continue to increase and improve our course offerings related to Health Careers and Sciences, 
which are integral for our theme-based program. Some of these courses include Environmental Science, Psychology, 
Ecology, Computer Science, and Anatomy and Physiology. We have also implemented a Dual Language Program that 
will be expanding from 1 grade to 3 grade levels where select students will have 50%/50% immersion in both English 
and Spanish in core content areas. The school climate and culture is a clear strength. We continue to strengthen 
academic interventions and social-emotional supports for students and maintain a student peer-counseling program 
through the Peer Group Connection. 

 

The Capacity Framework Elements in which the school exhibited the most growth are Effective School Leadership, 
Collaborative Teachers and Strong Family-Community Ties. Some examples of growth made in Effective School 
Leadership and Collaborative Teachers are: in school year 2016-2017, we achieved ratings of Well Developed indicator 
1.4 - Positive Learning Environment and indicator 4.2 - Teacher Teams and Leadership Development. In the 2017-2018 
school year, we achieved a Well Developed rating in indicator 5.1 - Monitoring and Revising Systems. We created and 
supported credit accumulation programs along with Regents prep/tutoring and credit recovery programs, which 
students attended consistently. In addition, we increased college and career readiness offerings for students including 
a college advisement team. Lastly, students and teachers alike are both empowered; students have an active student 
government and Town Hall meetings where they can voice their concerns. Teachers have a teacher team 
configuration by content area, where they are led by teacher team leaders, who also meet on a weekly basis with the 
administration. Joint School Cabinet and Team Leader meetings also support shared-decision making and effective 
leadership collaboration. In the team leader/administrative meetings, teacher team leaders introduce concerns, 
initiatives, policy ideas and professional development ideas that support our school community. The school 
administrative team reviews all initiatives/policy ideas and a vote is conducted with teacher team leaders. The 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

initiatives are then introduced to all teacher teams and a final vote is made in the team leader/administrative team 
meetings. 

 

Regarding Strong Community and Family Ties, many parent workshops were held on understanding their child’s 
transcript, technology training and also training parents in the effective use of the Skedula/Pupil Path grading system. 
In addition, we provided parents opportunities to assist them in understanding the school accountability systems 
including the School Quality Review Report and the Learning Environment Survey Report. These workshops were held 
in both the daytime and the evening in order to accommodate working parents and there was an increase of parent 
attendance at these events. 

 

Our teachers, parents and students utilized a common grading system: Skedula/Pupil Path. This system allowed 
students and parents to remain informed of current academic standings in every class. Teachers have created 
Common Core aligned units, which they are continually refining. They continue to meet in teams and evaluate their 
work. Each department engages in collaborative inquiry through the implementation of the Data Wise Improvement 
Process, and the school has adopted common planning time for teachers to augment their practice. Additionally, our 
community lead partner, Catholic Charities, administers surveys to the students to ensure that each child has 
someone s/he feels connected to. 

 

Areas of focus for us this year are to ensure that the schools’ instructional focus is prevalent and consistent in each 
classroom through all content areas. In addition, we will focus on continuing to strengthen our curricular unit 
alignment in all content areas. Lastly, we will strengthen our interim assessment plan based on common 
departmental formative assessments. 

 

The Programmatic Model for Expanded Learning Time at Health Careers and Sciences will be fostered in several 
creative ways to support the current Renewal Schools expectation of 7 hours and 20 minutes. One way is by 
embedding additional elective/core courses in students’ schedule. All students have a 9 period day to provide 
additional courses including a second Math, Science and/or Literacy elective to provide academic supports as well as 
approximately 80% of the 9th grade students participating in the CTE program by taking Health Core, a state approved 
Health Careers curriculum and 12th grade students having a college preparatory course. Additionally, select students 
based on need have been programmed for a 10th period in Science or Math to address credit gaps and/or Regents 
preparation. 

 

In closing, we will continue to work with earnest to provide a quality education and experiences that will prepare our 
students to develop the academic, social and personal qualities necessary to realize their fullest potential as life-long 
learners and productive, caring citizens of the world.

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Our goal for the 2018-2019 school year is informed by analysis of several data sources: student performance on the 
Algebra I (Common Core) Regents Exam and the Living Environment Regents Exam, teacher practice, as measured via 
the Advance System, and district-wide initiatives. 

 

In June 2017, 34 out of 134 (25.37%) first-time test takers passed the Algebra I (Common Core) Regents Exam with a 
score of 65 or above. In June 2018, 31 out of 78 (39.74%) first-time test takers passed the Algebra I (Common Core) 
Regents Exam with a score of 65 or above. 

 

In June 2017, 17 out of 84 (20.23%) first-time test takers passed the Living Environment Regents exam with a score of 65 
or above. In June 2018, 34 out of 63 (53.97%) first-time test takers passed the Living Environment Regents exam with a 
score of 65 or above. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

 

Our school community has structured professional learning community, data-driven instruction and the Data Wise 
Improvement Process, a structured intervisitation system, structured instructional coaching and peer coaching, 
protocols for discussion and entry points to access content, and standards-based curriculum. 

In reading, writing and speaking tasks, students are able to use strategies and protocols to cite textual evidence and 
engage in student-to-student discussion; students are not doing as well with reading and writing aligned to the content 
and struggle with using academic vocabulary. Teachers have begun studying student level data; giving common 
formative assessments, and modifying curriculum, but the instructional practices/supports that are implemented are 
inconsistently supporting ELL and level 1 students. 

To build teacher facility to analyze formative and summative assessment data in order to develop differentiated 
curriculum and instruction to improve Regents performance outcomes. 

 

 

 

The aforementioned strengths and needs were based on trends from the following sources: June 2018 Regents Exam 
Item Skills Analysis, 2018 NYSESLAT Data and the 2017-2018 Quality Review. An analysis of the June 2018 Regents 
Examination Item Skills Analysis provided by Central shows that overall average points earned on most Regents exams 
have increased, performance on constructed response questions such as short responses, document-based questions 
and essays, is an area in which our students struggle. Additionally, 2018 NYSESLAT data shows the following averages for 
each English Language Proficiency Areas/Modalities: 13 points out of 24 points for Listening, 14 points out of 21 points 
for Speaking, 13 out of 27 points for Reading, and 5 out of 12 points for Writing. Furthermore, the Quality Review from 
2017-2018 indicates “The strategic use of scaffolds supported most students’ access to being engaged in appropriately 
challenging tasks, however similar clearly purposeful strategies were not implemented with the same level of high-
quality supports in all classes." 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
We believe that students learn best when learning is socialized and collaborative. This is reflected in our school’s 
instructional focus: to engage students in high quality, Common Core-aligned, text-based discussions through a range of 
strategies, as a means to access, process, deepen, and demonstrate their content and concept understandings within 
and across subject areas. 

 

We have the following structures in place: 

 

Instructional Cabinet  
Instructional Leads Planning Committee  

  Professional Learning Community teacher teams 
 
 
  Coach/Administration Strategic Planning Committee 
  Teacher Leader Instructional Support Planning Committee 
  Content/ Department Level Meetings 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18 

 

  Curriculum Design Committees 

 

IPC, Mid-Year and EOY Summative Conferences 

These core beliefs are illustrated through a range of practices evident in teacher team collaboration, teacher 
planning, and classroom instruction. 

Our school’s instructional focus is to engage students in high quality, collaborative, text-based discussions and 
writing tasks as a means to access, process, deepen, and demonstrate their content and concept understandings 
within and across subject areas. 

To provide students with these learning experiences and communicate high expectations, teachers: 

 

intentionally plan rigorous, collaborative tasks that engage all students and require them to demonstrate 
their content and concept understanding, verbally and in writing 

  deliver lessons using high-quality questions and techniques to facilitate text-based, student-to-student 

 

discussions and writing products aligned to the Common Core Instructional Shifts 
consistently assess and provide students with clear, actionable feedback and next steps to ensure their 
progress and success 

 

To successfully participate in these learning experiences and achieve the high expectations set for them, students: 

· actively engage in rigorous tasks that require the demonstration of content and concept understanding, verbally 
and in writing 

· thoughtfully and respectfully respond to high-quality questions, both verbally and in writing, using text-based 
evidence, as well as academic and content vocabulary (Common Core Instructional Shifts) 

· give and apply actionable feedback and next steps from teachers and peers to improve work products and further 
develop skills and understandings 

 

We believe students build the academic skills and personal behaviors to be successful in both college and career 
when learning is socialized and collaborative. Through this approach, all students have opportunities to generate 
ideas and express their thinking through text-based discussions and writing. 

 

We have several methods for promoting the instructional focus consistently across classrooms, including but not 
limited to: 

· School Policies: All members of our school community are informed of what our instructional focus “looks like” in 
action and practice through our Schoolwide Instructional Expectations; this document is referenced and reviewed on 
a regular basis over the year. 

· Classroom Observations: Administrators provide teachers with actionable feedback and next steps that reflect our 
instructional focus. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

· Coaching Support: Coaches, Instructional Lead teachers, and our Teacher Leaders (Model Teacher, Peer 
Collaborative Teacher) use our instructional focus as a lens for structured inter-visitations; feedback and next steps 
provided also align with these expectations. 

· Learning Walks: School leaders, coaches, and Instructional Leads conduct classroom walkthroughs, visiting 6-8 
classes, and align their observations and holistic feedback and next steps to our instructional focus. 

 

 

Lab Classrooms: Our Peer Collaborative Teacher, Model Teacher, and select Instructional Leads work with coaches to 
enhance their classroom practice so that colleagues can visit to observe our instructional focus “in action”; teachers 
apply their learning and findings from these to inform their own practice.  

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
Our vision: 

  Provide a high quality common-core aligned curriculum that supports the state scope and sequence. 

Currently in mathematics, we are implementing the EngageNY curriculum, in Science we are implementing 
New Vision, ELA HMH core curriculum in SS we are implementing New Visions core curriculum with Passport 
Integration. 

  With curriculum, our expectations and professional development support reading, writing and discussion 

aligned to the content. 

  Additionally, we support a data-driven curriculum where teachers use common summative and formative 

 

assessment.  
In order to support academic curricula/content access, content-specific departments have created various 
Regents-aligned strategies/protocols to support student learning. 

  Priority for us to support Common Core standards is to engage students in high quality common core-aligned 
text-based discussions and evidence based reading and writing. We also support students in text-dependent 
questions. Writing and use content specific vocabulary to show understanding and reading comprehension is 
infused in all content areas.  
In mathematics, we are focused on coherence within and across grades, fluency of skills required by major 
standards, and the student development of deep understanding of core math concepts. 

 

 

Common-core aligned curriculum will be implemented in all classrooms. Instruction will be delivered and 
supplemented with strategic, evidence-based grouping structures, to provide ample opportunities for students to 
engage with key concepts and turning points through rich text-based discussions and frequent writing tasks. Student 
progress towards learning goals will be tracked, monitored, and used to inform revision to instruction through the 
administration and analysis of frequent assessments. 

 

Teacher and student programs are intentionally designed to address evidence-based learning needs including 
supports as well as Advanced Placement courses. Additionally, some grade levels will provide secondary literacy 
courses to provide supports for our ENL students. Students will also be enrolled in supplementary math and/or

science courses - either electives or intervention programs - based on their instructional needs and required levels of 
support or extension. 

 

We believe our students learn best when teachers design curriculum that is flexible, engaging, and accessible to all 
learners, with frequent opportunities for students to practice and improve their skills to demonstrate mastery. To 
design high-quality instruction, teachers: 

 

· Offer student choice whenever possible 

· Allow students to demonstrate their learning in multiple ways and formats 

· Design extensions to challenge high-performing students to apply their skills in new and creative ways 

· Provide multiple means for students to access content and skills 

· Select texts and resources that are culturally relevant and meaningful to students experiences 

· Arrange experiential learning activities to museums, events, and performances connected to the curriculum 

· Remove scaffolds and supports when students demonstrate independent mastery 

 

To provide teachers with opportunities to enhance and improve their curricula, administrators, coaches, Peer 
Collaborative Teacher, Model Teacher, and Instructional Leads: 

 

· Establish and share school-wide templates and tools for curriculum documents to ensure consistency, common 
understandings, and alignment across grades and subject areas 

· Demonstrate best practices by creating exemplar curriculum documents and tools for use with teacher teams 

· Support teachers in designing rigorous, Common Core-aligned summative assessments (Performance Tasks) to 
anchor and guide student learning 

· Support teachers in designing frequent, common formative assessments to anchor and guide student learning 

· Model how to use student work and evidence of learning to inform, modify, enhance, and extend curricula so that 
all learners are appropriately challenged 

· Ensure curricula reflects our school’s core beliefs of how students learn best and our instructional focus 

· Provide teachers with actionable feedback on their draft curricula materials for revision and refinement using the 
New York City DOE Literacy Instructional Materials Review Rubric 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 

It is expected that all teachers: 

 

· Use the school’s standard templates for all curriculum documents 

· Upload, share, and digitally collaborate on curriculum documents in the appropriate folders on the Drive 

· Submit all unit plans to your direct supervisor for feedback for revision 

· Plan and implement a minimum of three summative assessments (Performance Tasks) for semester-long courses 
and six summative assessments for year-long courses 

· Utilize findings from analysis of student work to inform and enhance instructional plans 

· Apply feedback and suggestions from administrators, coaches, and colleagues to revise and refine curriculum plans 

· Incorporate Collaborative Professional Learning Community (CPLC) Strategies to differentiate and revise curriculum 
for all levels of learners 

 

To further support our students in building literacy skills that will prepare them to be successful in college and careers 
and develop a lifelong love of learning, we are implementing Literature Circles as an instructional routine in ELA 
classrooms. Select teachers will continue to attend professional development training workshops offered through the 
NYC Department of Education to ensure effective implementation of Literature Circles in their classrooms. 

 

Lastly, we have purchased updated curriculum materials, including new textbooks, so that students can have copies 
to keep at their home and use for regular homework assignments and ongoing reference. By applying the skills they 
learn in the classrooms independently to high-quality textbooks, students will improve their conceptual 
understanding of the content for each course they take and build the requisite habits of mind for success in both 
college and careers. This strengthened understanding will lead to improved outcomes on Regents Exams and in their 
future educational experiences.  

 

Our school’s curriculum focus is to establish a common language and set of expectations for curricula that is 
consistently evident across classrooms so that it is accessible for all learners.  

 

 

 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
Students will have the opportunity to take four core Advanced Placement courses in the upcoming school year - AP 
Literature and Composition, AP Language and Composition, AP United States History, and AP Environmental Science, as 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          22 

 

well as AP Studio Art: 2-D Design and AP Statistics. Additionally, they have opportunities to take College Now courses 
coordinated through our College Advisor. 

 

All 9th graders will be enrolled in an Advisory program, focusing on leadership skills and successful habits of mind, 
throughout partnership with Peer Group Connection (PGC). A select group of 11th and 12th graders will be trained in 
the PGC Leadership curriculum and be responsible for mentoring and teaching a class of 9th graders on a weekly basis. 

 

Cohort Groups in 9th, 10th and 11th grades will participate in a Dual Language Program where they will be immersed in 
both English and Spanish for all of their core classes to develop their biliteracy. 

 

All 9th graders will be enrolled in the school's CTE program for Nursing. The program will begin this year with the Health 
Core Curriculum. 

 

To further support our science-based initiatives, we are offering several electives in the 2018-19 school year, including 
Psychology, Ecology, Physics, Chemistry, Marine Biology, Anatomy and Physiology and Hydroponics/Aquaponics.  

 

These diverse course offerings are made through the support of our Programmer consultant, who collaborates regularly 
with our full-time Programmer, Guidance counselors, and school leaders to review student data and inform the 
development of a range of rigorous and engaging classes for students.  

 

Units of study are aligned to instructional shifts. Teachers develop learning plans with knowledge of the standards and 
implement appropriate scaffolds when necessary. To ensure these documents reflect the instructional shifts, all 
curriculum materials are shared by the school community on Google Drive so that administrators and coaches can 
provide feedback for improvement by inserting Comments; teachers revise, reflect, and review these documents 
consistently over the school year. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
 

Lesson plans are informed by both formative and summative student assessment data. The curriculum supports 
reading, writing and discussion aligned to the content. 

Across classrooms, lessons are anchored in skills-based outcomes (Aims) and delivered through effective direct and 
indirect teacher instruction. Students are intentionally grouped in configurations best suited to the learning goals of 
the lesson and the varied needs they have demonstrated. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          23 

 

Classroom instruction must be designed coherently so that students' build and enhance their skills as they progress 
through the curriculum. Teachers formatively assess student learning on a frequent basis; this data is analyzed and 
used to inform strategic instruction for whole-class, small groups, and individual students. 

Teachers model skills and thinking routines for students, rather than simply providing them with an example. These 
think-alouds demonstrate the approach and tasks students will then use in small groups and independently. 

 

Over the course of a unit of instruction, students are provided with multiple opportunities to engage in structured 
conversations and evidence-based discussions before producing a written analysis response.  

 

 

Language supports are given where appropriate, depending on the specific program that best supports students’ 
needs. Appropriate scaffolds such as dictionaries, glossaries, graphic organizers, and/or visual aids are given as 
needed or where appropriate. 

 

We provide an instructional environment where students have subject-specific notebooks, appropriate grade-level 
materials, technology-infused instruction (chromebooks, interactive whiteboards, Google classroom). 

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
To support our teachers in developing flexible curricula that provides a range of multiple entry points, our Schoolwide 
Instructional Expectations require that all lessons include opportunities for student-to-student discussion as a means to 
provide access to all learners. Teachers also incorporate specific reading and writing strategies and thinking routines 
into their instruction so that all students can fully participate in rigorous tasks and produce meaningful work products. 

 

Examples of these strategies include: 

 

· Frayer Model: Thinking about a new word in this way helps students develop a more thorough understanding of its 
meaning and connection to their own background knowledge.  

 

· Interactive Lecture: This method of instructional delivery that includes several opportunities for students to engage 
with the content and skills they are learning with classmates at periodic points of a planned lecture.  

 

· Mind Mirrors: When used in reading literature and fictional works, this strategy supports students in accessing the 
text and examining character development; when used in reading informational texts this strategy supports students 
in understanding key aspects, beliefs, and characteristics of important individuals through text-based dialogue and 
collaboration. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

 

· Read/Think, Write, Pair, Share: This paired cooperative learning strategy improves reading comprehension, 
increases classroom participation and accountability, and allows the teacher to gage student and class understanding 
of the key concepts in the unit.  

 

· See Think Wonder: This routine encourages students to make careful observations, develop thoughtful 
interpretations, and create their own questions that may set the stage for further research, inquiry, and exploration.  

 

· Text Rendering: This protocol supports students as they collaboratively construct meaning, clarify, and expand their 
thinking about a text.  

 

· Multi-Paragraph Outline: This graphic organizer tool supports students in learning how to construct a composition 
that includes an introduction, body and conclusion. 

 

 
 

Say, Mean, Matter: This strategy that helps students question the text, search for deeper meanings, and 
make connections between text and their lives. 

RACE Strategy: RACE is an acronym that supports students in answering open-ended response questions 
(Restate, Answer, Cite, Explain). 

Text-Graffiti: The strategy serves several purposes: to activate prior knowledge, to engage students in 
analysis and interpretation early in a unit, and to assess students’ readiness to engage with the complex text - 
and ideas or concepts. 

Collaborative Carousel: This is a communicative and interactive opportunity for students to get up and move 
around a room in a circular fashion, stopping intermittently to comment, discuss, or respond (verbally or in 
writing) to probing headings/ questions/topics/themes posted by the teacher related to a given topic/theme. 
Glossaries:are use to help students to translate texts dealing with very specific content.  

 

We are offering a range of programs and digital applications to better support struggling students in developing the 
skills they need to be successful, particularly on state assessment Exams. These programs include CASTLE Learning 
and Achieve3000 - both of which allow teachers to design customized instruction for individual students to target skill 
gaps, as well as to generate a wealth of student data for analysis and to track and monitor progress towards goals.  

 

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
We have a multi-faceted approach to assessment systems for the upcoming school year. Baseline assessments, 
including Gates-MacGinitie and the San Diego Quick Test, will be administered at the beginning of the school year. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          25 

 

 

Common Midterm and Final Exams, aligned to the curriculum, will be administered at quarterly in core classes. 

 

Mock Regents Exams will be administered at the beginning, middle, and end of school year. The resulting data will be 
disaggregated and analyzed by teacher teams to inform strategic planning. 

 

Teachers will administer frequent, common formative assessments to gauge student understanding that will also help 
address curricula updates. 

 

All educators will select student writing products, in response to a department-based prompt, to be included in their 
Writing Portfolios four times over the course of the school year. Student responses are evaluated using our Common 
Writing Skills scoring system to ensure alignment and monitor progress towards goals. 

 

In addition, next year we are establishing a Data Wise Team, detailed below: 

 

The Data Wise Improvement Process is a step-by-step cycle that teams of educators can use to build an evidence-based 
culture of collaborative inquiry to make sense of data and ultimately use it to drive improvement. It brings coherence to 
a school’s improvement efforts while building the capacity of teachers and school administrators to create long-term 
success. 

 

Data Wise Model Sites and receive on-site coaching from ORS staff members, professional development from Data Wise 
expert consultants, and off-site training opportunities from Data Wise staff members. 

 

Data Wise is an 8 step process that guides teams of teachers and school leaders to: 

 

1. Organize for Collaborative Work using a rolling agenda, engaging in a plus/delta protocol, assigning specific roles to 
team members. 

2. Build Assessment Literacy through creating a data inventory, analyzing assessment data and reviewing basic statistical 
principles 

3. Create a Data Overview using charts and graphs that are clearly labeled and easy to understand 

4. Dig into Student Data by examining student work samples from classroom assessments and exit tickets 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          26 

 

5. Examine Instruction through teacher observations and intervisitations 

6. Develop an Action plan based on findings from digging into student work and examining instruction 

7. Plan to Assess Progress by determining what evidence to collect and how and when to collect it in order to show 
impact of agreed upon interventions and changed practices 

8. Act and Assess by reflecting on the impact of agreed upon interventions and changed practices

4b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
We plan to engage parents/families through a series of PA Meetings, Parent Learning Walks and SLT Meetings.  

The first Monday of every month, from October 2018 - May 2019, the PA meeting is held and run by the Parent 
Coordinator, Parent Liaison and Principal to communicate the expectations of what is going on in the school as well as 
making them aware of the necessary supports available to their students including extended learning time, Saturday 
tutoring and other programs offered through our partnerships.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 
5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health) 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 5 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
5.2  The school leader establishes overarching systems and understandings of how to support and 

sustain student social and emotional developmental health and academic success. 

5.3  The school articulates and systematically promotes a vision for social and emotional 

developmental health that is aligned to a curriculum or program that provides learning 
experiences and a safe and healthy school environment for families, teachers, and students.  

5.4  All school stakeholders work together to develop a common understanding of the importance 

of their contributions in creating a school community that is safe, conducive to learning, and 
fostering of a sense of ownership for providing social and emotional developmental health 
supports tied to the school’s vision. 

X 

5.5  The school leader and student support staff work together with teachers to establish 

structures to support the use of data to respond to student social and emotional 
developmental health needs.  

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 

SOP(s) 

Addressed 

 

 

 

 

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
5.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

  Data from the Quality Review from 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 shows that our school was rated “Well 

Developed” in 1.4 Positive Learning Environment. The following quote is from the 2016-2017 Quality Review: 
|School leaders and staff strategically develop professional development opportunities and family outreach 
to connect with student learning and support. Impact: Structures are in place that support an inclusive and 
safe environment that ensures student voice is meaningfully incorporated and allowed to initiate, guide and 
lead improvements to school culture.” 

  However, according to the NYC Survey 2017-2018, Preventing Bullying is an area of focus as the data is 9% 

below the Borough Average. Though we do have support services including an attendance team, success 
mentor program, mental health clinic and social worker, we must strengthen alignment of all of the school 
support services to support students’ social-emotional development health.  

The school pursued and is receiving Community School Funding, and DYCD's In-School-Youth (ISY) funding to 
supplement the socio-emotional development initiatives at the High School. Catholic Charities Community Services 
(CCCS) is the service provider for the Community School and ISY grants. Because of this additional funding club 
offerings and extra-curricular activities are available to students after school and on Saturdays. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

We continue to increase incentive-based programs to improve student motivation such as award ceremonies, 
motivational lunches and rituals (Town Hall meetings) that routinely recognize student success (academic, 
citizenship/leadership, and attendance, most improved and service). 

 

The Community School has partnered with New York Presbyterian (NYP) Hospital to bring in a robust mental health 
support system. Mental health staff include one full-time LMSW and shared access to two full-time Ph.D 
psychologists. Mental health staff work closely with Community School staff and school staff to provide a wealth of 
mental and emotional health services for all students in the school. 

 

With the support of CBO partnerships, the school Student and their families have improved and enhanced parent-
teacher communication and interaction to further student achievement. We have used the Skedula/Pupil Path 
system, the school phone messenger, a monthly Principal's newsletter, monthly parent workshops, and parent 
learning walks. In conjunction with Catholic Charities, we will continue to strengthen academic interventions and 
social-emotional supports for students and will enhance our student peer-mediation program for improved conflict 
resolution. In addition, the school engaged parents in an off-site retreat to build community among the school's 
parents. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision?

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

 

Our school has a robust practice of inquiry-based teacher team collaboration. All educators participate in Collaborative 
Professional Learning Cycles (CPLC) sessions three days a week during 6th period and engage in looking/analyzing 
student and teacher work, develop instructional plans to extend and remediate student skill gaps, and hone their 
implementation of a specific strategy across their department. Teachers also inter-visit and analyze Low Inference 
Transcripts and Implementation Alignment Checklists to hone strategies and improve their practice and coherence 
across classrooms.  

 

This work is designed to address our school's priority, which is to build teacher facility to analyze formative and 
summative assessment data in order to develop differentiated curriculum and instruction to improve Regents 
performance outcomes. From this, we have devised the following Problem of Practice to drive this work: 

In reading, writing and speaking tasks, students are able to use strategies and protocols to cite textual evidence and 
engage in student-to-student discussion; students are not doing as well with reading and writing aligned to the content 
and struggle with using academic vocabulary. Teachers have begun studying student level data; giving common 
formative assessments, and modifying curriculum, but the instructional practices/supports that are implemented are 
inconsistently supporting ELL and level 1 students. 
 
During our Collaborative Professional Learning Cycles, department teams engage in the Data Wise Collaborative Inquiry 
Improvement Process and in learning about Writing Strategies to address Common Core Learning Standards and shifts

required on state Regents examinations. Teams have focused on text-based answers in literacy and application in 
mathematics. Multiple department teams have also focused on content and academic vocabulary acquisition.  

 

Department teams collaboratively determined a learner centered problem by analyzing aggregated and disaggregated 
student data and work, determined a teacher problem of practice by conducting and analyzing intervisitations, and 
developed an instructional strategy that builds a common high level skill to meet the needs of varied learners. Teachers 
documented the process of developing a Learner-Centered Problem, Problem of Practice, and an Action Plan through a 
shared “running” Google Doc that features analyses of student work, shared successes and challenges, inter-visitation 
notes and trends, implementation alignment checklists, as well as collaboratively developed strategies and rubrics.  

 

Implementation of the department-wide strategy is monitored in several ways: Learning Walks, informal and formal 
classroom observations, inter-visitations, teacher anecdotal feedback, lesson analysis, student work analysis. This 
information is shared and reflected on at Instructional Cabinet Meetings.  

 

Among the different data sources we use to drive this work include: Regents Data, Quality Review results, Formative 
Observation Data and NYSESLAT results.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

All educators meet during 6th period three days a week to engage in inquiry-based professional learning sessions based 
on the Data Wise Improvement Process from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. These core meetings 
are our Collaborative Professional Learning Cycles - CPLCs. Each department team is led by a colleague who is a teacher 
designated as an Instructional Lead. Our vision is to use data to improve teaching and learning, resulting in increased 
student outcomes. 

The Data Wise Improvement Process is an 8-step process. The first three steps are focused on preparing teacher teams 
to engage in cycles of inquiry and the next five steps are focused on analyzing data, implementing instructional 
improvements, and assessing the effectiveness of the action plan. Teacher teams will engage in at least two cycles of the 
Data Wise Improvement Process during the course of the year. Each step is described below: 

Step 1: Organizing for Collaborative Work 

During this step, our school organizes team members to compile, inventory and manage data from various sources. 
School leaders establish team structures, schedules and calendars that enable team members to engage in collaborative 
work. This step involves setting expectations for effective meetings, setting norms for collaborative work, 
acknowledging work style preferences and. This ensures coherence within and across department teams. 

Step 2: Building Assessment Literacy 

During this second step, teachers discuss how skills and knowledge measured on assessments compare to the broader 
domain of skills and knowledge that students need to master. Teacher teams learn how to understand and explain to 
others how results are reported for the various class, school and state assessments that their students take. Teacher 
teams learn to use a common language when discussing and interpreting data, including the ladder of inference. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

Step 3: Creating a Data Overview 

During this third step, the school instructional leadership team narrows the scope of inquiry by identifying a focus area 
of school-wide instructional improvement. Next, the leadership team analyzes data related to the focus area and 
identifies a story that is important for staff members to think about. The leadership team presents the data pertaining 
to the focus area in a few well-designed charts that make it easy for staff members to see the story. Finally, the 
leadership team creates an opportunity for teachers collaboratively make sense of data charts and identify questions 
arising from the data that they are interested in exploring. 

Step 4: Digging into Student Data 

During this fourth step, teacher teams look at student work samples (including class work, homework, group projects, 
and benchmark assessments), observe students as they work, and ask students questions about their learning. Teacher 
teams work together to make sense of student data, using strategies to ensure that all team members contribute to the 
conversation. Finally, teacher teams identify a common learning challenge among students that is specific, small, within 
teachers’ control, based on evidence, and directly connected to a question that matters to them. 

Step 5: Examining Instruction 

During this fifth step, teacher teams look at teacher-generated materials (including lesson plans, assignments, and 
assessments), observe teaching and learning in classrooms, and ask teachers questions about their practice. Teacher 
teams observe teaching practice for the non-evaluative purposes of (1) developing a shared understanding of what 
current practice looks like across teachers and (2) generating ideas about what effective practice could look like. Teacher 
teams work together to make sense of instructional data, using strategies to ensure that all team members contribute 
to the conversation. Teacher teams identify a common teaching challenge that is specific, small, within teachers’ 
control, based on evidence, and directly connected to the learning challenge that they identified when looking at 
student data. 

Step 6: Developing an Action Plan 

Teacher teams collaboratively select a research-based instructional strategy for addressing their problem of practice. 
Teacher teams collaboratively identify indicators that describe what students and teachers will be doing and saying 
when they are using the instructional strategy in their classrooms. Teacher teams create an action plan that concisely 
captures the specific problems of learning and teaching that they will address, the instructional strategy they selected, 
and the list of tasks to be done (including who is responsible for doing them and by when they will be completed). 

Step 7: Planning to Assess Progress 

Teacher teams work collaboratively to identify or develop short- medium- and long-term data sources that they will use 
to evaluate the impact of the action plan on student learning. Teacher teams set goals for student proficiency and/or 
growth that they will measure using short-, medium-, and long-term data sources. 

Step 8: Acting and Assessing 

Teacher team members complete the tasks assigned to them in the action plan, including implementing the 
instructional strategy in their classrooms. Teacher teams assess their completion of action plan tasks and determine the 
extent to which what is happening across classrooms matches what they expected to see when they developed the 
plan. Teacher teams collect and analyze data from their short- and medium- and long-term data sources and determine 
the extent to which student learning goals are being met. Teacher teams adjust the action plan based on based on 
evidence collect about implementation and student learning. Teacher teams and the leadership team make a point of 
documenting, learning from, and celebrating improvements in learning and teaching. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

To further make improvements on our teacher team collaboration, we plan to: 

  Continually use a plus/delta protocol at the end of each Instructional Lead and Department Meeting to 

continually receive feedback from teachers and improve meetings and activities.  

  Allocate dedicated time on alternating Thursdays for teacher leaders to facilitate structured, Professional 

Learning Communities (PLCs) aligned to the school’s annual goals. Teachers will have a menu of PLCs to choose 
from on alternating Thursdays where they will learn about practices to enact in their classrooms and will receive 
feedback from their peers. 

  Differentiate professional learning sessions provided during CPLC times for targeted groups of teacher teams to 

meet separately in break-out groups: 

o  Dual Language teachers will receive specialized professional development once every two weeks 

Special Education teachers will meet separately from CPLC once every month to complete students Individual 
Educational Plans (IEPs), in addition to their team meeting related to compliance 

 

Teachers engage in common planning practices where they co-plan lessons aligned to the standards, differentiate 
common curriculum, formative and summative assessments; teachers support parallel teaching models as well as 
station teaching models for Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners. 

Teachers team teach in English Language Learner classrooms where the content specialist addresses the content via 
direct and indirect instruction and the ELL specialist addresses the language needs. 

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
Instructional Cabinet members collaborate weekly to support the improvement of teacher practices and student 
learning. We regularly share findings from classroom visits using our Tiered Teacher Tracker. Data from this tool informs 
strategic coaching methods and partnerships. School leaders regularly attend and participate in CPLC sessions, as well as 
co-facilitate Instructional Leads Meetings. 

 

In addition, all CPLC/Data Wise strategies are modeled by coaches in cabinet meetings to familiarize supervisors with 
their benefits as they align to the Danielson Framework and build student college and career ready skills. Supervisors 
incorporate this knowledge into their evaluations and actionable next steps.  

 

Through formal and informal observations of classes, administrators make strategic programmatic decisions that impact 
student learning. 

 

On a bi-weekly basis, during our Professional Learning Time, Special Education teachers work on developing the 
classroom practices that lead to high impact on student performance with the supervisor.

Led by a colleague designated as an Instructional Lead, teacher teams develop a research-based action plan 
collaboratively during Collaborative Professional Learning. Department teams move through Steps 4 through 8 of the 
Data Wise Improvement Process: Dig into Student Data, Examine Instruction, Develop Action Plan, Plan to Assess 
Progress, and Act and Assess. Norms and Protocols have been collaboratively established by the teachers to acceptable 
standards of professionalism. 

Teacher teams engage collaboratively to analyze aggregated student data and determine patterns based on the school’s 
focus for Data Wise. Next, teacher teams select a group of students that represent a cross-section of the overall student 
population and analyze student work products to determine a shared learner-centered problem (LCP). After the team 
determines a learner-centered problem, teachers will engage in intervisitations to identify trends in instruction and 
determine a teacher problem of practice (POP). Teachers will develop an action plan that indicates what teachers will do 
differently in the classroom and, as a result, what they expect students to do differently that addresses the learner-
centered problem. This process includes teachers identifying research-based instructional strategies and practices and 
agreeing on the instructional strategy the department will commit to implementing.  

Teachers choose assessments to assess teacher implementation of the action plan and assess student learning. As a 
next step, teacher teams evaluate the impact of their action plan on student learning and adjust the action plan based 
on evidence collected.  

Teacher teams then begin the Data Wise Improvement Process starting with Step 4 and repeat the cycle. 

 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
All teacher teams present to each other at various benchmark dates throughout the school year, specifically at the end 
of each cycle. This serves to spread inquiry honed best practices across the school. For example, in 2017-2018, the Social 
Studies Department developed the document-based question checklist and now other subjects are looking to see how 
the checklist can be implemented in their subject areas. 

Instructional Leads with another year of Coaching support under their belt will be better equipped to facilitate multiple 
protocols across multiple teams in the 2018-2019 school year, which will result in more efficient meetings and shared 
leadership across the school.  

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Working in collaboration with the CBO, the Parent Coordinator and the Parent Liaison, when monthly Parent Learning 
Walks are scheduled, we will include times for the parents to observe the CPL work conducted on Wednesdays during 
6th period. This will allow parents to observe the work teachers are engaged in and how it relates to their child's 
success. The parents, guided by the Parent Coordinator and the Parent Liaison, will be able to see students engaged in 
their class activities which are related to engaging in student-to-student discourse, content-specific writing activities 
and other forms of academic practice. Parents will be able to engage with a wide range of students, not just their 
own, to get an understanding of what is occurring on a day-to-day basis in the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 2 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable, 

Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive 
of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (RSCEP). 
Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital 
resources. 

2.3 

2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 

Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and 
track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback. 

2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve critical 
individual and school-wide practices as defined in the RSCEP (student achievement, curriculum 
and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement; and student 
social and emotional developmental health).

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Instructional teams consistently analyze assessment data and student work for students they share. The majority of 
teachers are engaged in Data Wise, a structured, inquiry-based professional collaboration that promotes the 
achievement of school goals and the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards. Our instructional teams 
use strategic inquiry-based methods to support at risk students and or those students who require additional support 
structures. Our teams have used with fidelity the New Visions Data Sorter to perform cohort analysis and identify credit 
gaps; create graduation action plans/next steps; evaluate marking period performance to develop Academic 
Intervention Services and have meticulously studied Heat Map to target chronically absent students. Our teams 
continually studied interim assessment data; Writing Strategies data; common frequent assessment data; student work 
products such as daily homework projects and class work and our Writing Portfolio model with rubric . Our teams work 
closely with the School-Based Health Center and School-Based Support Team to monitor support services for students 
who may required additional assistance. This data study has been used to create academic intervention services. 

 

According to the SEC report, teachers feel they have a wide range of skills to teach students with diverse abilities, 
learning styles, and cultural backgrounds, who are low performers and who have limited English proficiency. This gap in 
literacy proficiency has been an area of focus for our school. A large number of students entering our program are 
coming in with a 3rd , 4th and 5th grade reading level and in some cases much lower. Invariably, this creates a 
tremendous strain on teacher level planning and preparation and has significant programmatic implications. Because 
students should attain New York State English Proficiency in 4 years or less, the pressure is on for students, and their

families. Research suggest that in order for students to obtain cognitive academic language proficiency skills, a period of 
6 to 7 years is a honest reality. The majority of our students who don't graduate on time are students that have not met 
the New York State Language Proficiency benchmark. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

Instructional Cabinet meetings are held on a weekly basis. The team follows a pre-determined Agenda with time-bound 
items and tangible meeting outcomes. As a group, we read professional texts and follow protocols to ensure equity of 
voice.  

 

School leaders adhere to a transparent system of accountability that is built on a shared foundation of mutual respect 
and trust.  

 

Teacher observations, Support Logs, and anecdotal evidence of instructional practice are collaboratively reviewed and 
used to inform targeted professional development and strategic partnerships across classrooms. Data from our Teacher 
Tracker is analyzed and updated periodically.  

 

All decisions are made by the team as a unified group, never in isolation.  

 

 
 

 

On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year? 
evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve school-wide practices. 

 

What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s 
vision, mission, and instructional focus?  
We develop our Professional Development Plan in collaboration with Instructional Lead teachers and Teacher Leaders 
over the summer to ensure consistent understanding and messaging.  

 

Our instructional focus is printed and posted across classrooms, where teachers and students refer to it consistently 
throughout the year. Our vision and mission is also communicated on documents including the Staff Handbook, our 
school policies, and professional learning materials created by our coaches. Teachers also include these elements on 
their lesson plans or other curricula.  

 

 
 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher 
leaders to build broad capacity within your school?  
The instructional vision for supporting differentiated leadership is supported by using capital resources, to hire 
instructional coaches, teacher leaders, and administrators who support a framework for building leadership capacity. 
Considering the mentioned, the various stakeholders including parents, students, the CBO and members of our school 
community are designated with different responsibilities and roles to lead in our educational institution. We believe in 
shared decision making, collaborative learning and shared responsibility. 

There are multiple opportunities and methods to build teacher leader capacity. 

 

Professional Learning Committee 

Instructional Leads, representing each content area, attend weekly meetings with school leaders facilitated by 
Instructional Coaches/Directors of Collaborative Professional Learning, to monitor and refine the implementation of the 
CPLC’s. These meetings will build the facilitation and leadership skills of Instructional Leads as well as monitor and refine 
the implementation of the CPLC’s as they pertain to these Essential Questions: 

 

How does each collaborative professional learning cycle... 

· ...result in School-wide implementation of an instructional best practice/strategy that engages all learners? 

· ...inform smart actionable feedback to all community members? 

· ...balance conceptual understanding with procedural fluency? 

· ...inform data driven differentiated instruction to support all learners? 

· ...help build the skills necessary for students to be successful in college and career? 

· ...build teacher leader capacity? 

 

Content-Based New Teacher Mentors 

New Teachers will be inducted into the profession through a formal partnership with an experienced educator in their 
content area. Mentors attend monthly meetings with Instructional Coaches to support them in their roles and train 
them in the NTIMS Mentor Tracking System. These meetings will build the collaborative, facilitative, and instructive 
skills necessary for Mentors to support new teacher development and conduct classroom visits and debrief conferences. 
Over the course of the Mentoring process, these visits and debriefs may be co-facilitated by Instructional Coaches to 
provide Mentors with ongoing feedback and actionable next steps. 

 

Lab Classroom Teachers 

During each CPLC, teachers will develop and implement instructional best practices/strategies related to the inquiry 
question. Specific teachers’ classrooms that exemplify highly effective implementation will be identified and designated 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

as Lab Classrooms; these sites will be utilized to facilitate and enhance the ongoing School-wide adoption of these 
collaboratively developed approaches. Instructional Coaches/Directors of Collaborative Professional Learning will 
arrange and facilitate inter-visitations/debriefs to these Lab Classrooms with targeted groups of teachers to observe the 
instructional best practice/strategy in action and devise next steps. This process ensures that all teachers are able to 
effectively implement key components of the School’s Instructional Culture and gives all educators the opportunity to 
be respected as professionals that contribute to improved teacher practice and student learning. 

Learning Walks 

Throughout the course of the school year, Learning Walks will be utilized for several purposes, including: 

 

1. School leaders, administrators, and Instructional Coaches will engage in Learning Walks to multiple classrooms, within 
and across schools, in order to collect low-inference objective data, identify areas of strength and areas of growth, norm 
and calibrate using the Danielson Framework, and collaboratively determine actionable next steps for teachers and 
administrative/coaching support. 

 

2. Instructional Coaches/Directors of Collaborative Professional Learning will accompany targeted groups of teachers 
and Instructional Leads on Learning Walks to multiple classrooms, within and across schools, in order to collect low-
inference objective data, identify areas of strength and areas of growth, and collaboratively determine actionable next 
steps for teachers and coaching support. 

 

Learning Walks will be completed using a range of lenses, with different constituents in attendance and specific 
classrooms visited, strategically planned based on demonstrated teacher and student needs; these structures include 
but are not limited to: 

 

· Visits across department classrooms to observe and track progress in the implementation of targeted CPLC 
instructional best practices/strategies 

· Visits across a sampling of classrooms to gather evidence related to a particular indicator from the Quality Review or 
Danielson Framework 

· Visits to a series of classrooms through lenses of different types of students (English Language Learners, Students With 
Disabilities, High Achieving Students, and those students struggling for reasons such as Over-Age or Long Term 
Absences) to ensure feedback considers multiple entry points 

· Visits to lab classrooms across schools to observe new and innovative teaching tools and techniques as a means to 
inform and enhance Instructional Lead and Coaching practice

New Teachers will be inducted into the profession through a formal partnership with an experienced educator in their 
content area who they will meet with once/week. New Teachers will also attend bi-monthly meetings facilitated by 
Instructional Coaches/Directors of Collaborative Professional Learning to build their reflective skills and support their 
growth.  

 

 

 

How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together 
with other stakeholders? 
By measure of distributive leadership and shared-decision our school community has gradually expanded it voice. 
Various school level teams have been created that are run by a multitude of school stakeholders. Our parents are 
members of many of the teams and some teams are led by our community school partners. Key initiatives and 
suggestions are introduced by instructional leads; teacher leaders, coaches, community school partners; parents and 
student leaders. Additionally, student government and Town Halls are used as vehicles for promoting student voice; 
important to mention, the Peer Group Connection (PGC) provides students with an opportunity to become youth 
leaders and provide workshops to other young people so they can grow their life skills. With this in mind, our Peer 
Forward group supports young people with the college application process, life skills and resume writing. In regards to 
the Parents, the School Leadership Team, Parent Association Meetings and Parent Learning Walks provide parents an 
opportunity to make their thoughts and ideas heard.

Each teacher will have a log of support denoting the 
positives and actionable next steps resulting from their 
various support forums (Coach, Administrator, Teacher 
Team Meeting). This process will be made transparent 
to each teacher and at various benchmark points 
throughout the year, will be reviewed and reflected 
upon with Coaches, Supervisors, Colleagues).  

 

In addition, all CPLC strategies are modeled by coaches 
in cabinet meetings to familiarize supervisors with their 
benefits as they align to the Danielson Framework and 
build student college and career ready skills. 
Supervisors incorporate this knowledge into their 
evaluations and actionable next steps.  

 
  

 

What kind of evidence based systems would a school leader put in place to ensure that the school and individuals 
continues to improve? What kind of supports? Who would he/she collaborate with?

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Working in collaboration with our CBO, we will engage Parents in learning walks, regular communication via monthly 
newsletters and participation in our monthly PA Meetings. We regularly invite the parents to the school and have an 
open-door policy where we meet with parents to show them the supports being provided as well as giving them 
suggestions on how to work with their children at home. This does not operate under a specific timeline as it is an 
ongoing process. We share with parents the materials that are being used in the classes. Teachers communicate this 
with the parents in collaboration with the Parent Coordinator, Parent Liaison and the CBO.

Our school partners closely with the community and families to promote positive growth for the entire school 
community. Parents are encouraged to be in the school and active in the myriad of offerings designed to empower 
participants to understand their agency in our school community. The school hosted monthly parent learning walks over 
the course of the 2016-17 school year, these are monthly opportunities for family members to sit in classes with their 
children during the school day. We had great success with parent learning walks this year, it helped to build a stronger 
community of engagement for the entire school. 

 

Throughout the year our school hosts parent workshops with topics that included: parenting skills, understanding 
educational accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations, literacy and accessing community and 
support services, and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home. 

 

In partnership, we work with the lead CBO to host gatherings designed to connect parents with other parents. Parents 
who are comfortable talking with and working with other parents contribute more to the school community, thus, we 
provide regular platforms for these relationships to develop. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

We will continue to work with the Parent Association to establish support structures for improved understanding of 
their child’s progress by training parents in the effective use of Skedula/Pupil Path. 

 

Our school provided opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability systems, e.g., ESEA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Guide, Quality Review 
Report, and the Learning Environment Survey Report. 

 

With the support of the Community School, the parent advocate and the parent coordinator, parental engagement at 
PA meetings continued to swell this year. . While we met the city average for high schools, we must increase the 
number of parents attending meetings. Attendance for family nights and parent teachers conferences is not strong, we 
look to develop in this area in the coming school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

 

We are keenly aware of the importance of parent engagement and how having a community of involved parents can 
dramatically change a school. Therefore, we have, with determined effort, increased strategies to further engage 
parents in their child’s education. We have learned that in the 21st century, we can communicate more effectively with 
parents with advanced technological systems. Because our Parent Association Meetings are not filled to capacity, we 
feel it is important to continue promoting opportunities for parent engagement so parents may continue to stay 
informed regarding their child’s academic progress. We provide parents with Parent and Student Handbooks to provide 
necessary information regarding the school. Our staff employs bilingual staff members who are able to provide 
translation services as needed for all parents. 

 

One of our goals for welcoming parents and their support is to hire family members through the AmeriCorps program. 
The objectives of this is: increase parent engagement, promote parent leadership, increase parent roles in shared 
decision making, and involve parents in the Community Schools initiative, allow parents to support other parents in the 
school. 

 

Beyond monthly Parent Association Meetings, the Community School will host monthly community partners meetings. 
A few objectives of these meetings are: to engage community and families in the role the school plays in the larger 
community, to explore how school can leverage community resources to support students and parents, to 
explore/answer school safety concerns and questions and share the vision of a safe learning environment, to inform the 
community of set benchmarks and challenges, and to inform community and parents of the current fiscal condition and 
budget plans and/or priorities. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

We currently offer a literacy class for parents who are interested in learning English. This is done via a partnership with 
the Adult Education Department through the DOE and supported by Community School funding. The Community School 
has one fulltime program coordinator conducting outreach and retention work with adult ed . Our school staff will 
continue to conduct parent workshops centered on: understanding educational accountability, grade-level curriculum 
and assessment expectations, literacy and accessing community/support services, and technology training to build 
parents’ capacity to help their children at home. 

 

We will, for the first time, offer a parent retreat this year. This is an opportunity for parents to get out of the city 
together to grow as a team. We anticipate great ideas and stronger engagement as a result of this retreat. 

 

 

To increase parent engagement and participation, the school holds regular parent meetings. The school, in 
partnership with the CBO’s Family Advocate and the Office of Family and Community Engagement (FACE) is working 
to develop leadership and facilitation skills. Parent’s will be coached to run small group sessions with other parents 
during parent association meetings. These small groups will be conversation based, community and capacity building 
focused 

 

The school offers all parent services in the English and Spanish languages. If a parent speaks a language other than 
English or Spanish, the school provides translation services. The school works hard to support all families and their 
busy lives. PA meetings are held in the evening, after traditional work hours. Dinner is always served and parents are 
invited to bring their children. For larger meetings, child services are available free of charge. If our meeting times do 
not work for families, our Parent Coordinator will work with that family individually to ensure they receive the 
meeting information. We have an open door policy, families are invited to schedule meetings every day of the week 
except Sunday. 

 

Teachers are coached by the school social workers, psychologist and teacher coaches on parent engagement practices 
and collaborative problem solving. 

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
As a school building we created a designated family welcome office near the entrance. All family members entering the 
school are assisted by this single stop service center. If additional services or communication is necessary, family will be 
directed respectively. We provide parents with Parent and Student Handbooks to provide necessary information 
regarding the school. Our staff employs bilingual staff members who are able to provide translation services as needed 
for all parents.

Professional development for administrators, teachers, and staff are in place to encourage the development of 
welcoming environments for students and their families. Teachers are encouraged to meet with and communicate 
regularly with student's parents. 

 

In addition to the Family Office at the entrance of the school, the Community School Office, the parent coordinator, 
guidance counselors, and the principal all have an open door policy to student's parents.  

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
With the support of the Community School, we collect "count on me" forms from parents when they participate in 
school activities and events. Parents are identified and asked to take leadership roles within the school based on their 
interest and their time availability. The Community School employs one parent leader to recruit and support parents 
and their opportunities to lead in the school. This has been a pivotal role that in partnership has greatly increased 
parent engagement in the school. 

 

 
 

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
In partnership with the Community School, the school engages the community and their families and ensures two way 
learning with teachers through the following: 

 

School Leadership Team (SLT) is created and structured to bring school personnel together with family members. The 
SLT members use data and their personal expertise to advise school level decision making. School employees and family 
members hold equal power and decisions are made democratically.  

 

Community School Team monthly meetings - meetings bringing community partners and school staff to the table to 
make school level decisions in a democratic manor. 

 

Spring Community School Forum - spring meeting designed with parent volunteers bringing together family members, 
school staff, and community partners to study data and determine areas of focus with actionable plans. 

 

 

What types of supports does the school provide to families to encourage them to take an active role in what their 
child is learning?

Developing soft and hard skills necessary to advocating and 
supporting their children through their high school 
education 

providing family members with English language classes 
and referral services to trade school opportunities 
strengthens families agency and their ability to support 
their child emotionally and financially. These classes are 
offered three days per week in the evening hours. 

The school runs a attendance model assigning a point 
person from the school to work with each student in the 
school. This model allows parents to have a direct contact 
with the school keeping a clear and transparent  

During the fall, the school will bring parents on a one day 
retreat to build communication and relational skills among 
parents. Strengthening the parents skills enables more 
advocacy and community participation. 

How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for 
families?   
Family partnerships with 
school: 

Families partner with the school through the following: 

School Leadership Team 

 
  Parent Association Meeting 
  Parent Learning Walks 
  Workshops 
  Adult Education Classes 
  Parent Retreat 
  Parent Teacher Conferences 
  Parent Volunteer Program 
  Paid ParentAdvocate 

Family partnerships with CBO: 

  
The Community School employs one parent in the parent advocate position to work 
30 hours per week in the school to support students and parent engagement efforts. 

 

The community school offers a host of opportunities for family and cboto work 
together. Families frequently participate in community fairs, parades, forums etc. 

 

CBO Youth Advocates work closely with students of the schooland their families. The 
Community School office is always open to parents and hosts a host of resources to 
families. 

  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

Is there dedicated space for 
these partnerships? 

Parents are encouraged to learn more about school offerings through the family 
welcome center or the parent coordinators office -- both designated spaces for the 
family members to visit. 

 

The community school office located in the school has an open door policy 
encouraging parents to make frequent visits. 

 

The school also has space available for parents in the parent coordinator office and, 
in addition, is creating a room on the floor for parents. 

 

 

 

What is your vision for the role the school will take in providing access adult education classes within the community? 

Our vision is to educate our parents within our community so they can be more of a support to their children in regards 
to their college and career readiness. Additionally, a goal of the program is to allow the parents to be employable and 
contributing citizens to our community. We currently offer literacy classes for parents and community members 
interested in increasing their proficiency of the English language. This class is taught through the Adult and Continuing 
Education division of the Department of Education, and supported through additional funding from the Office of 
Community Schools. With continued engagement, classes will grow in content area. Our school staff will continue to 
conduct parent workshops centered on: understanding educational accountability, grade-level curriculum and 
assessment expectations, literacy and accessing community/support services, and technology training to build parents’ 
capacity to help their children at home. 

 

 

What data and student progress feedback loops will be present at the school to ensure that families knowledgeable of 
their children’s scholastic success? 
Families are all encouraged to use Skedula/PupilPath to regularly check on their child's academic and attendance 
progress. Parents can schedule meetings with the guidance counselors or community school staff for consultation or 
more information about their child's' progress. 

 

Four sessions of parent teacher conferences are held each year, this is an opportunity for teachers and families to 
discuss students performance and improvement plans. 

 

The school has an open door policy, always open to parents and the community. Part of this policy includes the parent 
learning walks, which enables parents to see classes in action and to offer their feedback.

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description 

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
100% of our 9th grade students will participate in Expanded Learning Math. 100% of our 10th and 11th grade students 
will participate in Expanded English Language Arts. Based on need, 100% of our 10th, 11th and 12th grade students 
who have Regents gaps will participate in Expanded Learning Time related to subjects of need. 

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type 

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory? 

 

Voluntary 

X 

Compulsory 

Renewal ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students, 
including special populations, will participate fully in Renewal ELT. 
Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will 
actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students. 
Through regular review of attendance records and review of Scholarship Reports, the school will be able to ensure 
participation of the students. Additionally, the programmer in collaboration with the guidance counselors will 
regularly review the New Visions Data Sorter to ensure participation in said programs as well. 

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description 

Target Population: The ELT program for a Renewal School will be offered to all students in the school. 

Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program: 
How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make 
learning relevant and engaging?   
How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day? 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as 

to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of 
graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and 

language mandates are met during ELT? 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the 

supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to 

school faculty and community partner staff? 

  What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners? 
  How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement? 
  How will effective outreach be conducted to families? 
  How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage 

participation? 

The Programmatic Model for Expanded Learning Time at Health Careers and Sciences will be fostered in several 
creative ways. One way is by embedding additional elective/core courses in students’ schedule; for example, 
expanding the mathematics and language/literacy instruction we provide our students. All 9th grade students will 
receive one additional period of math for school year 2018-19. Additionally, approximately 80% of the 9th grade 
students will be participating in the CTE program by taking Health Core, a state approved Health Careers curriculum. 
All 9th grade students will have 9 periods in their school schedule. Under this model, our 9th grade students will exceed 
the current expectations of 7 hrs and 20 minutes requirement, which Renewal Schools are required to support and/or 
comply with. 

 

Our 10th graders this year have an additional ELA course with a focus on Common Core Writing. All 10th graders will 
have a 9 period day on their school schedule. Also, based on need, 10th graders will have an additional Math or 
Science elective to support Regents preparation. Under this model, our 10th grade students will exceed the current 
expectations of 7 hrs and 20 minutes requirement, which Renewal Schools are required to support and/or comply 
with. 

 

Expanded Learning Time for 11TH grade students is embedded in the school program. Our 11th grade students have an 
additional Science elective and/or a Math elective to support Regents preparation. All 11th graders have an additional 
ELA course with a focus on Common Core Writing. All 11th grade students will have a 9 period day on their school 
schedule. Under this model, our 11th grade students will exceed the current expectations of 7 hrs and 20 minutes 
requirement, which Renewal Schools are required to support and/or comply with. 

 

Expanded Learning in the 12th grade will be supported via our academic learning program. Our 12th grade students 
will have a college preparatory course as well as a second literacy/writing elective. Pedagogical practice will be both 
via direct and indirect instruction. Under this model, our 12th grade students will exceed the current expectations of 7 
hrs and 20 minutes requirement, which Renewal Schools are required to support and/or comply with. 

 

Additionally, select students based on need have been programmed for a 10th period in Science or Math to address 
credit gaps and/or Regents preparation.

implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

School staff and the CBO will work closely to provide the supportive services (college-readiness, advisory, academic 
intervention services, guidance and counseling, transitioning, parent engagement, STEM, experiential learning & Life 
Skills) for every student in the school. These services will allow the school to offer: 

● Strong instruction designed to provide personalized learning opportunities for students. 

● Robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that schools are welcoming and 
empowering to students, families and community members. 

Continuous improvement using school and student data to tailor programming and instruction focused on results. 

 

The community school team will be led by a Community School Director (CSD). The CSD will oversee a team of 2 youth 
advocates, one parent advocate, three ISY staff, one adult education coordinator, one administrative assistant, and 
provide daily direction (though not supervision) for the LMSW who is based in the Community School Office. The 
entire community school team will work closely with the school staff under the direction of the CSD to provide all 
supportive services to students, families and school staff. 

 

The CSD will oversee the school's attendance team. Using the New Visions data sorter and attendance heat map as a 
guide, the CSD will implement a Success Coaching and a Success Mentoring model ensuring that there are building 
staff members responsible and accountable for each students attendance and academic success. The attendance 
teams will meet one day per week. Success Coaching teams, led by a guidance counselor and a CBO youth advocate, 
will also meet one day per week to address students attendance and academic needs. 

 

The CSD will also chair the SLT ensuring proper protocol and operations of the SLT.

Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

 

The Community School program will be implemented by the lead CBO – Catholic Charities Community Services. The 
program will be overseen by the principal, who will work in close collaboration with Catholic Charities’ Community 
School Director. Catholic Charities will coordinate services with partnering CBO’s to ensure high quality, relevant 
services are being provided to all students. 

 

The lead CBO will be instrumental in the implementation of the ELT program. The CBO will provide: 

 
 
 
 

case management services for 160 students 
attendance support for the entire school 
alternative school transfers for students who would benefit from other environments 
leadership program for the PGC program. 

 

Additionally, CBO staff will be designing and facilitating ELT college and career readiness, leadership development, 
and lifeskills programming. When deemed appropriate, the CBO will subcontract specialist to support the ELT; 
examples of this will be SAT and Regents prep. 

 

The lead CBO will lead the Community School Team (CST). The CST will meet monthly and consist of the schools 
community partners. The CST will be a time to discuss the schools instructional and holistic focus, community 
partners will implement plans to support the school to ensure proper supports are provided for students, their 
families, and the school staff. The CSD will oversee the CST meetings. Members of the CST include members from the 
following organizations: Catholic Charities Community Services, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Row NY, Isabella, 
Cornell Cooperative Extension, Columbia Graduate School, iChallenge Myself, New York Public Library, School Safety, 
Urban Yoga Foundation, Ramapo for Children. 

 

Students will be monitored closely to assess impact of programming. All CBO staff will be trained in Skedula/Pupil 
Path to allow for attendance and academic tracking. Twice a year students will be given surveys polling their 
perceived level of support and safety, and quality of education. This data will be utilized to maximize supportive 
services. Students will also be assessed on the 4 Year College Readiness Index to determine their degree of college 
readiness, and hence the impact of services being provided. 

 

New Visions Data Sorter and Heat map will be referenced and utilized in all the work that is done. Attendance teams, 
success coaching teams, success mentors are given access and trained in the tool to inform their work. All members 
of the attendance team receive daily emails with information about students who are absent and need follow up. 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

 

Weekly training sessions are held for all members of the school community using the data sorter. The school is in 
close communication with the new visions liaison for technical support with the tools. 

 
Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
Community School program success will rely greatly on the CBO’s resources. Utilizing the CBO’s 8 full-time staff for 
ELT and subcontracted specialist, as well as parent and community volunteers will be necessary. The expanded 
requirements will require an extended day for all students. Additionally, three days a week, adult education classes 
run until 9:00pm. 

 
Part 3c. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates. 
Entering 9th grade students will participate in a summer academy during the end of the summer to help prepare for 
the transition to high school. Community School programming ELT will begin immediately for 9th, 10th and 11th grade 
students and run for the entire year. For 12th grade students the program will also begin immediately and focus on 
college and career readiness (SAT prep. and college essay support for seniors, college exposure, readiness/leadership 
development.)

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

All teachers will be fully licensed and certified in their specific subject areas and committed to differentiated 
instructional strategies to ensure service for all students. Appropriate state and city certifications accompanied by 
quality training ensure that effective teaching practices are utilized. 

 

The principal and assistant principals will attend all hiring fairs seeking out qualified candidates for all positions at the 
school. The school's hiring procedures fall under article 18G and we will adhere to all guidelines that accompany this 
process. 

 

School budget funds will be allocated to support individual learning sessions for teachers of ELL and special needs 
students. 

 

Teacher teams collaborate frequently and develop department goals and or benchmarks. School leadership staff 
meets with new teachers weekly and provides constructive feedback to provide support and next steps as teachers 
progress towards tenure. 

 

Teacher candidates are interviewed more than once by a committee of students, parents, teachers and 
administrators. Teacher candidates are required to perform a demo lesson and bring a portfolio of developed learning 
plans/curriculum. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          85 

 

New Teachers will be inducted into the profession through a formal partnership with an experienced educator in their 
content area who they will meet with once/week. New Teachers will also attend bi-monthly meetings facilitated by 
Instructional Coaches/Directors of Collaborative Professional Learning to build their reflective skills and support their 
growth. 

 

The school provides multiple opportunities to develop teacher facility including membership in the Instructional 
Leads, Instructional Cabinet, and activity facilitators to engage the retention rate of the teachers. We also provide 
consistent supports that make teachers feel valued and incorporated as members of the school community. 

 

Every year, we review Teacher Preference Forms as a means to determine the teaching assignments for the teachers 
from year to year. Additionally, the administration reviews Scholarship Data and Regents Data to ensure the teachers 
are programmed to their strengths as to how to best support our students. 

 

All staff is invited to participate in various professional development sessions including in-house, as well as those 
provided by the Manhattan Field Support Center, Office of Renewal Schools, NYCDOE Office of ELLs as well as 
encouraging teachers to find additional professional learning opportunities. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

All new teachers are assigned mentors who commit quality time to providing support structures to help acquaint their 
new colleague(s). 

 

The school has collaborated with Generation Ready, Cornell, Urban Arts, the NY Hall of Science and network 
instructional staff and will tap into the borough content specialty teams to bring in other instructional specialists. In 
particular, literacy and history specialists are needed to work with all ELA and Social Studies teachers to improve 
literacy practices as well as discuss and implement differentiated instruction in curricular units to help improve 
student outcomes. Teachers will also participate in weekly professional development sessions that will focus on: 

  Development of rubrics for group work and participation and discussion 
  UBD and backward design for curriculum maps and unit plans as aligned to the Common Core literacy shifts 
  Essential questions & enduring understandings 
  Rigor & differentiation 
  Danielson 3d-checking for understanding and formative assessment (expeditionary learning) 
  DOK question stems and discussion and accountable talk 
  Tiered vocabulary, academic vocabulary and vocabulary development 

High-quality and ongoing professional development for teachers, administrators, and paraprofessionals (and, where 
appropriate, pupil personnel services, parents, and other staff) will be provided to enable the staff to develop 
required skills needed to support students academically in the classroom and support parents and build community 
with colleagues. As practices to support this we have instructional coaching, peer coaching, off-site professional

assessments and review the outcomes to make strategic changes based on student need. These sessions are 
facilitated by coaches and teacher leaders in conjunction with the administration to complete this work. Additionally, 
the principal meets regularly with the UFT Consultation Committee, comprised of the UFT Chapter Leader and select 
teachers to determine actions taking place in the school. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          88 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The HS for Health Careers & Sciences, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The HS for Health Careers & Sciences will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Begin description here:            
This program will target ELL students in grades 9 - 12, who comprise the ESL subgroups of 
students with 4-6 years of instructional service and long-term ELLs (over 6 years of instructional 
service).  The ESL instruction, which students receive during the course of the school day, will 
be supplemented with an after-school and Saturday program. ESL instructors will be given the 
disaggregated NYSESLAT scores for each student (RNMR & RLAT). The goal will be to focus 
on each student's particular area of weakness by giving language development and support in 
ELA as well as provide support in Mathematics. Later in the year, students will have 
NYSESLAT support incorporated into the sessions.  In addition, some of these students will be 
preparing to take Regents examinations in English and other content areas.   
 
The program will be as follows: 
 
ESL instruction:   Saturdays, 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM (begins September 15, 2018 – 31 sessions = 
186 hours) 
Students will receive support to develop their skills in Academic English for content areas 
including English, Social Studies, Science and Math:  Saturdays, 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM (begins 
September 15, 2018 – 31 sessions = 186 hours) This program will be taught by 2-
3 ESL/bilingual teachers and 2-3 content area teachers. 
 
The teachers will be given the NYSESLAT and the modality report which will address each 
student's proficiency level and will drive the instruction needed for mastery.  The ESL classes 
will be divided up into smaller homogenous groups for intensive practice. If the student's area of 
weakness is reading & writing, instructors will work with students using journals, response to 
literature prompts, short story analysis, NYS Regents essay practice and the Achieve3000 
software program.  For those whose weakness lies within the modality of listening & speaking, 
students will practice taking notes from engaging teacher-read material that is provided in their 
native language as well as in English. Other auditorily enhanced activities will be implemented 
with this particular group of students.   
 
We also hope to purchase 15-20 Chromebooks ($300/computer) to support the 
English acquisition process through the use of Achieve3000 which features informational texts 
and is suitable for all Lexile levels.

  name of provider 

Begin description here:            
ESL teachers will attend professional development sessions offered by the Division of English 
Language Learners and Student Support, periodically over the course of the year to enhance their 
understanding and classroom implementation of best practices for ELL students.  These teachers 
will turnkey their learning to other educators at both the grade and department team levels. In 
addition, Literacy Coaches will work with teachers to facilitate targeted professional 
development to teachers of ELLs. These will be incorporated into our 6th period Collaborative 
Peer Learning Community (CPLC) sessions which meet regularly three times per week on 
Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
All ESL teachers will receive professional development, facilitated by our school-based literacy 
coaches in collaboration with the representatives from the Office of Renewal Schools as well as 
from the Manhattan Borough Field Support Center. Additionally, all ESL teachers will receive 
Professional Development in applying the Achieve 3000 program into their instruction. This is a 
half-day PD session to be scheduled in accordance with the staff at Achieve 3000.  
ESL teachers will collaborate as a department to modify and refine instructional strategies and 
practices to use with ELL students during our school's Collaborative Professional Learning 
Cycle (CPLC) Sessions, meeting three times a week.  Teachers will also learn a range of writing 
strategies from their colleagues participating in the Writing Strategies (WS) professional 
development series facilitated through the Department of Education during these 
CPLC Sessions; all educators apply these strategies to their classroom instruction and participate 
in structured inter-visitations to hone their teaching sklls and ensure that their lessons are 
accessible and rigorous for all learners. Progress will be monitored through classroom 
observations, inter-visitations and data review related to Scholarship Reports and Cohort Tracker 
systems. Data will be reviewed by the instructional cabinet to determine effectiveness of the 
work and make necessary revisions. 
For all of the above, attendance records and Agendas are maintained by the Administration as 
well as electronically on Google Drive enabling the agendas to be shared and accessed by all 
relevant parties.

Begin description here:            
 
  ESL students comprise approximately 38% of the entire student body; however, even a larger 
percentage of the parents are monolingual Spanish speakers.  Due to the lack of English 
proficiency amongst our parent population, ESL classes will be offered for parents on Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. These parent ESL classes will begin in October 2018 and 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          98 

 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
will continue until June. Certified ENL instructors will be providing these classes offered 
through the Mid-Manhattan Adult Learning Center.   Topics to be addressed will include:  basic 
language acquisition skills, communicating in a variety of situations, and helping your child with 
the new standards.  The Parent Coordinator has been instrumental in conducting parent outreach 
for these parent ESL classes in past years, and she attends these classes to assist the teachers and 
ensure that parents receive full benefits from the ESL course. 
Workshops focusing on relevant and useful skills for parents will be given monthly from 
December through June from 6:00 - 8:00 PM on specified Mondays of each month. Concentrated 
outreach to parents of the 4 - 6 year and the over 6 year ELL students subgroups will be 
conducted so that these parents can attend and take advantage of these workshops.  Parental 
involvement is integral in increasing student literacy.   
 
Parent workshop topics will include: 
-English Language Courses for Parents (Saturday program and the cost will be at no charge to 
Title III funds.) 
-College Readiness -  many bilingual students will be the first ones in their family to attend 
college; workshop to be held in December 2018, presented by the college advisor for parents of 
bilingual students, both juniors and seniors.  
  -How to Finance College - many parents and students need assistance in exploring financial aid 
options and in filling out the FAFSA; workshop to be held in January 2019, presented by the 
college advisor for parents of bilingual students, both juniors and seniors.   
-Academic Supports for ELL Students (2 Sessions) - parents need to know what supports are 
available for  them and their student; workshops to be held in February and March of 2019 
presented by the bilingual guidance counselors and assistant principal of ESL  for parents of 
bilingual students, grades 9 - 12. 
-Cultural Workshops  - parents (especially newly- arrived immigrants) need information 
on  transitioning into American systems and culture; workshop is to be held in April 2019, 
presented by the bilingual guidance counselors and assistant principal of PPS for parents of 
bilingual students, grades 9 - 12.  
-Bullying - bullying and cyber-bullying is an ongoing problem for teen-agers and parents need 
information and advice on this subject; workshop to be held in May 2019, presented by the 
bilingual guidance counselors and a dean who is trained in peer mediation for parents of 
bilingual students, grades 9 - 12. 
-Transitioning to a New City and Place - parents (especially newly-arrived immigrants) need 
information on services and agencies in NYC; workshop to be held in June 2019, presented by 
the bilingual guidance counselors for parents of bilingual students, grades 9 - 12. 
Outreach to parents will be provided in the following ways: 
All written materials are translated into the home languages of parents participating in the 
program in order to ensure that they fully benefit from the learning activities. The Parent 
Coordinator will be responsible for the translation of all notifications, flyers, emails and letters 
sent to parents which invite and inform them of upcoming events.  
Conferences between parents, bilingual guidance counselors, and students will be held during the 
school day; after school and Saturday meetings will serve working parents.  These guidance 
conferences will focus on student academics, family literacy and support services and small 
group counseling.  Referrals will be provided to the on-site psychologist and social worker from 
the school-based NY Columbia Presbyterian Clinic if needed and future career and college 
opportunities will be explored.  Parents will be encouraged to attend the parent workshop series

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Teacher-generated assessments and Achieve3000 are used to assess skills of students. Teachers work in collaboration with the 
administration and instructional coaches to design the periodic assessments that will be used to assess the students 
throughout the year. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Working with the assessments, teachers work in teams to perform inquiry work around the data to determine appropriate 
next steps. Once inquiry work is done, teachers review and revise curriculum to make adjustments to meet the needs of the 
students in their classes. This is part fo the work done when teachers meet in grade level teams throughout the week. 
 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          103 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We utilize the NYC Performance Tasks as well as the Gates MacGinitie Reading exam and Achieve3000 to provide information 
on our students. Teachers also administer teacher-designed pre-assessments.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data has been gathered, the ENL Coordinator and the administration work with the programmer to determine any 
additional supports the children need. This may include additional interventions, targeted small-group instruction and 
programmatic changes if necessary. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We do not have this grade band. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
To evaluate and inform our ELL programs, we utilize the NYSESLAT and Regents data to primarily determine the performance 
of the students. Additionally, we administer the Gates MacGinitie and Achieve3000 final exams to provide additional data to 
us on reading levels and fluency. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

As the information comes in, the data specialist organizes the information and disseminates it to the administration to review 
with the teachers. Teachers have an opportunity to evaluate the data and see patterns regarding student achievement, 
progress and determine what programmatic changes need to occur. This information is shared not only with the ENL teachers, 
but all teachers so that proper curriculum revisions can occur. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The organizational model used in our Freestanding ENL program is that ENL students who have scored Transitioning, 
Expanding and Commanding are mixed heterogeneously with general education students. This class of students 
travels together for all of their core subjects that are taught by the appropriately licensed pedagogue. Additionally, 
their core English class is co-taught by a certified ELA teacher and a certified ENL. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

The organizational model used in our Transitional Bilingual Education program is that ENL students who have scored 
Entering, Emerging and low Transitioning are mixed heterogeneously and travel together for all of their core subjects. 
Instruction is delivered by certified ENL teachers, bilingual teachers, and/or teachers who have a bilingual extension. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

The organizational model used in our Dual Language program is that the class is made up of approximately 50% in 
English and 50% in Spanish for all of the students in the program. The students are mixed homogeneously and will 
have instruction delivered one language at a time, depending on the course, without translation, so that students are 
immersed in both languages and therefore, will process language acquisition in a natural way. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          104 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

We have one NLA certified teacher along with five certified ENL teachers who provide the mandated number of minutes.   In 
freestanding ENL programs, language arts is taught using ESL and ELA methodologies.  Content areas are taught in English 
using ENL strategies.  Native language support is provided.  Students in the TBE program continue learning content in their 
native language while developing English proficiency.  The curriculum will be on grade level in the native language classes.  The 
native language usage in the content area classes will decrease as students' English proficiency increases. 
 
Students’ ENL instructional minutes are determined by their proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT exam.  Students are placed in 
one of the following proficiency levels: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding.   
 
a)  Specific ENL, ELA, and NLA Minutes are as follows: 
• Students who are in the Free Standing Monolingual ENL program receive: 
540 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Entering. 
360 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Emerging. 
180 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Transitioning or Expanding 
90 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Commanding 
 
• Students who are in the TBE ENL Program receive: 
540 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Entering. 
360 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Emerging. 
180 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Transitioning or Expanding 
90 instructional minutes/week of ENL when they are Commanding 
 
• In addition to the ENL instructional minutes that they are receiving in the TBE ENL Program, students receive NLA (Native 
Language Arts). 
Entering students in the TBE program receive 60-90 instructional minutes of NLA daily. 
Emerging or Transitioning students in the TBE program receive 45-60 minutes of NLA instruction daily. 
Expanding or Commanding students in the TBE program receive 45 minutes of NLA daily. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our Freestanding ENL program, the students receive all of their content area classes in their target language (English). 
Teachers provide additional materials as supports as needed. 
 
In our Transitional Bilingual Education program, the students receive their ELA core class in English and other content area 
classes in their native language (Spanish) with planned changes and adjustments throughout the year moving toward a larger 
percentage of English acquisition. 
 
 
In our Dual Language Program, the students receive 50% of their courses in English and 50% of their courses in Spanish as a 
means to provide consistent immersion in both languages.  
  
The schools' instructional focus is collaborative learning and student-to-student engagement.  As per the NYSESLAT results, the 
ENL students do very well in the listening and speaking portion of the exam; therefore, this school-wide focus is particularly 
beneficial to all ENL students as it increases their exposure to the spoken target language and helps them to achieve success 
with the CCLS.  
 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          105 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Throughout the course of the year, the students are provided with assessments in their NLA classes to determine proficiency 
and skill levels. This information is shared with the teachers in the other classes to determine appropriate next steps and 
adjustments. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The HS for Health Careers and Sciences services five subgroups of ENLs: SIFE, Newcomer ELLs, 4-6 Yrs ELLs, Long-Term ENLs, 
and former ENLs. 
 
a)  Our Saturday Academy SIFE program will primarily focuses on students on fluency in academic English and Native Language 
Arts; this is the principal goal of our SIFE program.   Through ENL and content teachers’ collaboration, students will learn 
Native Language Arts, as well as English to improve their skills. 
  
b)  Our Newcomer ENLs (0-3 years in US schools) are taught by ENL teachers using the most innovative and up-to-date 
techniques that are aligned to the CCLS 21  st Century Learning Standards.  Technology is infused in all ENL classes, including 
the Achieve3000 software and  Readtheory.Org. Teachers use various scaffolding activities which are gradually removed once 
students show evidence of advancement in their language acquisition.   Our teachers of Newcomer ENLs make sure to tie the 
students’ heritage into the curriculum so that there is pride and a connection to their native language and culture. 
 
c)  In many ways, ENLs receiving 4-6 years of service make up our most challenging subgroup. We work closely with this group 
of students in order to prevent them from becoming Long Term ENLs. Teachers review the RLAT and the RNMR to better 
serve this group and make instruction individualized for them based on their strengths and weaknesses.  Once teachers know 
which components a student needs to work on, they can better create instruction for that student.  ENLs who have reached 
proficiency in one performance area but still need to reach proficiency in another, are given intense review in their area of 
deficiency.  After-school tutoring and Saturday Academy is encouraged for all ENLs, but especially for those who fall into this 
sub-category.   
  
d)  The long-term ELLs are also a challenge.  At times, they appear to be proficient because their spoken language is 
advanced. Unfortunately, these are students who may have achieved progress in one performance area, but not in the others. 
These students are very close to proficiency but it continues to elude them and they become extremely discouraged, fearing 
that they will never become a former ENL.  Teachers make themselves available in many ways: providing extra tutoring, 
encouragement as well as setting up appointments for students to speak with guidance counselors.   
  
e)  Former ENLs receive one extra period of an elective literacy class (ENL Writing) to bolster their newly gained proficiency 
level. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Instructional strategies and grade-level materials for ENL-SWDs are developed by special education teachers and ENL teachers 
in accordance to the students' IEP mandates.  They include a VAKT (visual auditory kinesthetic tactile) approach and 
differentiated instruction based on student learning styles.   Students are being taught a target language with the necessary 
supports of special education.  Materials and books are modified to better fit the needs of these students.  NYSESLAT 
preparation is continually incorporated into the ENL/Special Education curriculum.  
 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          106 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ENL students with IEPs receive ENL instruction in a freestanding ENL class.  We implement the same flexible programming that 
we use for SWDs non-ENLs, whereas students receive classes based on the recommendations in the IEP.  Common core aligned 
units are utilized in the classes along with scaffolded instruction. All decisions are based upon review of the RESI and EDAT to 
determine strategic moves.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We will be utilizing RIGOR Protocols for SIFE students. This may occur either for interventions via before, after school or on 
Saturdays.  In addition, all members of the school community will participate in professional development institutes that will 
focus on assisting ENLs acquiring mainstream content in the native and target language. Additionally, to provide additional 
supports to all ENL students, we will utilize Imagine Math as a targeted intervention support for Math and REWARDS, a literacy 
intervention program to assist in all other core classes. Our school in now partnered with Catholic Charities, our Community 
Based partner, where students will receive needed emotional and academic support. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data and trends, one new program is that we will be implementing a Dual Language program for the first time. We 
are beginning the program with our 10th graders who will move through the program for the next three years and graduate 
with the Seal of Biliteracy. The program will then grow and transition each year for all grade bands. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There are no bilingual programs that we have closed. We are adding Dual Language for the 2017-2018 school year. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our Title III Plan states that ELLs are provided equal access to all school programs. The ESL instruction, which students receive 
during the course of the school day, will be supplemented with an after-school and Saturday program. ESL instructors will be 
given the disaggregated NYSESLAT scores for each student (RNMR & RLAT). The goal is to focus on each student's particular 
area of weakness by giving language development and support in ELA as well as provide support in Mathematics. Later in the 
year, students will have NYSESLAT support incorporated into the sessions.  In addition, some of these students will be 
preparing to take Regents examinations in English and other content areas.  The program that will begin on Saturdays in 
October 2017 is from 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM.  Students will receive support to develop their skills in Academic English for content 
areas including English, Social Studies, Science and Math. These programs are taught by both ENL and core area teachers.If the 
student's area of weakness is reading and writing, instructors will work with students using journals, response to literature 
prompts, short story analysis, NYS Regents essay practice and the Achieve3000 software program.  For those whose weakness 
lies within the modality of listening and speaking, students will practice taking notes from engaging teacher-read material that 
is provided in their native language as well as in English. Other auditory enhanced activities will be implemented with this 
particular group of students.  Additionally, ENL students have equal access to all programs and supplemental services such as 
after-school/Saturday tutoring, the College Advisory Program, and credit accumulation courses. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELL subgroups (SIFE, Newcomers, 4-6 Yrs, Long-term ELLs, Former ELLs, and ELL-SWDs) have access to a variety of 
instructional materials including technology. Our ENL teachers use SmartBoards, LCD projectors, computers (laptops and 
desktops) and document cameras with their ENL students. We have a large number of VOX dictionaries and provide access to 
students via bilingual glossaries. We use the Achieve3000 Program, ReadTheory.org, Castle Learning and Imagine Math 
technology programs with our ELL students. These materials are used with all ENL subgroups in content areas as well as the 
ENL classroom.  Our classroom libraries have a variety of high interest/low level books which are age appropriate for high

school students.  We provide books in both the native and target languages.  Teachers of ENLs use the Smartboards in a variety 
of ways such as showing videos and audio recording excerpts to enhance lessons.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native Language support is used in all of the programs that the school offers to ENLs including the Transitional Bilingual 
Education, Freestanding ENL and Dual Language. Bilingual glossaries, dictionaries and books are available for students in all of 
their content area classes. Bilingual teachers, who are Spanish speakers, will use a minimum amount of Spanish in their 
classrooms - this is used only as a native language support as needed. Through periodic review of data (i.e. teacher-generated 
assessments and mid-year performance assessments), administration and teachers will assess impact of supports and make 
adjustments as necessary. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All materials used for ENL students are high school level and aligned with the NYS high school curriculum standards and the 
CCLS. Based on RESI data, supports are provided to students as needed.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school employs a campus manager who we work with should we need to schedule use of communal spaces to provide 
supports to all needs of our ENL students. These shared spaces include: theatre, music classroom, library, gymnasium and 
Student Success Center.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the school year begins, the Parent Coordinator, along with the administration and the ENL Coordinator will conduct a 
Parent Orientation for parents of newly enrolled ENL students. Additionally, ENL students are invited to participate in the 
Summer Bridge program which is taught by a licensed ENL teacher. Throughout the course of the year, as new students enroll, 
in addition to their interview, they will have opportunities to meet with the Parent Coordinator, guidance counselor and 
Parent Leader from our CBO to have individualized orientation sessions. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The High School for Health Careers and Sciences offers Spanish in the Native Language Arts, but no other language electives.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. Our school is implementing the 50/50 dual language model. Every day, students receive 50% of their 
instruction in each language. 
b. The literacy and Geometry courses are being taught in English and Native Language Arts, Earth Science 
and Global Studies are being taught in Spanish 
c. Instruction will be delivered one language at a time, depending on the course, without translation, so 
that students are immersed in both languages and therefore, will process language acquisition in a 
natural way. 
d. Both languages are being taught simultaneously.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All ENL teachers will meet three times a week with ELA and Foreign Language teachers for common planning meetings. The 
focus of these meeting will be to analyze data, look at patterns and trends across performance levels, analyze student work 
and develop systematic interventions and ways to better assist all ENLs in mastering academic content. Furthermore, our 
school is planning to do mini-professional institutes to better assist both ENL and all other teachers of core subjects to scaffold, 
create entry points for students, differentiate, and create an "all inclusive" environment, thus benefitting all learners.    
1.  All ENL personnel have been trained in the Achieve3000 program which also comes with several professional development 
days throughout the course of the year.  At these workshops, the teachers learn to analyze student data from Achieve3000 
and utilize it to better serve the needs of the students.  Teachers are also given strategies for enhancing the Achieve3000 
program. Incentives are a large part of the program; therefore, students are motivated to progress. 
  
2. ENL personnel have three common planning sessions per week.  A literacy coach works with the ENL staff weekly to align 
common core units of study. 
  
3. The ENL staff members have all of the 8th grade data relating to the incoming ninth grade students, including information 
regarding the NYSESLAT modalities and length of service for each student.  They are also attuned to student levels, so that 
program changes can be made if necessary. 
  
4.  Faculty meetings and department meetings occur two times per month from October to May.  Two meetings per year (1.5 
hrs) are devoted to imparting information regarding ENL students and the ENL department. 
 
5. During the Professional Learning days, which occur in November, January and June, our CBO provides workshops for all 
teachers on different ways to address the social and emotional concerns of the students in order to help them make academic 
achievements. 
 
For each meeting, agendas are created and teachers sign in that they have attended these PDs and meeting sessions.  All 
records are kept in office of the AP Supervision for ENL.  In addition, this year our school has a strong push for creating access 
and entry points for all learners by providing clear expectations, scaffolds, activities that will increase both student motivation 
and participation. 
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff members are trained in scaffolding techniques as well as cultural awareness for ENL students.  In addition, the staff is 
made aware of ENL students' records from JHS to better understand and serve the needs of the students.  Our school provides 
professional development to all teachers and administrators that  
specifically addresses the needs of ENL students.  We provide  the required professional development hours for all teachers 
prescribed by CR Part 80 during common planning sessions and additional institutes.  Records of all PD activities are kept in the 
office of the AP Supervision of ENL.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Guidance counselors in collaboration with the ENL coordinator, arrange individual annual meetings to discuss language needs; 
some meeting are held during school time and some are held in the evening to accommodate working parents.  If the language 
is Spanish, all three guidance counselors are fluent in this language as well as the ENL coordinator.  If the parent speaks 
another language, the services of the DOE translation unit are utilized. Additionally, as part of our new Dual Language program 
implementation, a series fo workshops will be held throughout the course of the year to provide information about the 
program and ways in which parents can support their students in support of acclimating to both languages properly. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

As described in our Title III Plan, ESL students comprise approximately thirty-seven percent (37%) of the entire student body; 
however, even a larger percentage of the parents are monolingual Spanish speakers.  Due to the lack of English proficiency 
amongst our parent population, ESL classes will be offered for parents on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. 
Certified ENL instructors will be providing these classes offered through the Mid-Manhattan Adult Learning Center.   Topics to 
be addressed will include:  basic language acquisition skills, communicating in a variety of situations, and helping your child 
with the new standards.  The Parent Coordinator has been instrumental in conducting parent outreach for these parent ESL 
classes in past years, and she attends these classes to assist the teachers and ensure that parents receive full benefits from the 
ESL course. 
 
Workshops focusing on relevant and useful skills for parents will be given monthly. Concentrated outreach to parents of the 4 - 
6 year and the over 6 year ELL students subgroups will be conducted so that these parents can attend and take advantage of 
these workshops.  Parental involvement is integral in increasing student literacy.  Parent workshop topics will include:-English 
Language Courses for Parents (Saturday program and the cost will be at no charge to Title III funds.)-College Readiness - many 
bilingual students will be the first ones in their family to attend college;  
-How to Finance College - many parents and students need assistance in exploring financial aid options and in filling out the 
FAFSA  -Academic Supports for ELL Students (2 Sessions) - parents need to know what supports are available for them and 
their students-Cultural Workshops - parents (especially newly- arrived immigrants) need information on  transitioning into 
American systems and culture -Bullying - bullying and cyber-bullying is an ongoing problem for teenagers and parents need 
information and advice on this subject-Transitioning to a New City and Place - parents (especially newly-arrived immigrants) 
need information on services and agencies in NYC 
 
Also, for our new Dual Language Program, the following workshops will take place approximately every other month: 
-Understanding the Goals and Benefits of the Dual Language Program - Parents will be able to discuss the concept of biliteracy 
and the value it provides for marketability 
-Understanding and Supporting Process of First and Second Language Acquisition - Parents will be able to describe the process 
of first language acquisition as well as list the differences and similarities for second language acquisition 
-BICS and CALP - Parents will understand the different functions of language use 
-Defining the Role of Parent Engagement at School - Parents will be able to list various ways in which they can be actively 
involved in class and school functions 
-Defining the Role of Parent Engagement at Home - Parents will be able to list various ways in which they can academically 
support their child at home. 
 
Outreach to parents will be provided in the following ways:All written materials are translated into the home languages of 
parents participating in the program in order to ensure that they fully benefit from the learning activities. The Parent 
Coordinator will be responsible for the translation of all notifications, flyers, emails and letters sent to parents which invite and 
inform them of upcoming events.  
 
Conferences between parents, bilingual guidance counselors, and students will be held during the school day; after school and 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          110 

 

 

Saturday meetings will serve working parents.  These guidance conferences will focus on student academics, family literacy 
and support services and small group counseling.  Referrals will be provided to the on-site psychologist and social worker from 
the school-based NY Columbia Presbyterian Clinic if needed and future career and college opportunities will be 
explored.  Parents will be encouraged to attend the parent workshop series along with the evening ENL classes to become 
more proficient in reading, writing and speaking English.For all parent activities, in addition to translated materials, we will 
provide in-person interpretation and translation services.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Javier Trejo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At the beginning of each school year we conduct a student home language survey (HILS) for incoming students. 
Our current population is approximately 535 students. Over 90% of our students speak Spanish at home. Of that 
90%, the majority of the Spanish speaking parents need translation services. This year, we also have students who 
speak Arabic and French.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          114 

Written Preferred

Language  

Based on the above 
findings, all 
communications that go 
out to the student body 
and their families must be 
translated into two main 
languages, Spanish and 
English. The parent 
coordinator calls parents of 
students who speak other 
home languages to ensure 
that there are no further 
translation services 
needed. If another 
translation is needed, 
appropriate arrangements 
are made with parent 
volunteers and/or the DOE 
translation unit. In addition, 
the parent coordinator 
downloads all generic 
Department of Education 
forms and letters in the 
appropriate language and 
mails them separately 
home to parents who need 
languages other than 
English and Spanish.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.  
 

Document Name  

Month/Frequency Distributed to 

How do you plan to translate? 

All communications that go out to our 
student body and their families are 
translated into Spanish. Spanish 

 

Families  

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents 

 

to parents.  

2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          115 

 
translations go out in all school 
mailings, whether the communications 
are invitations to events, notices of 
general parent association meetings, 
notices of open school days and 
evenings, or individual notifications 
regarding students. Approximately 50% 
of the staff members are literate in 
Spanish and assist with the Spanish 
translations for these materials. One 
teacher of Spanish has been appointed 
as the official school translator, as well 
as the parent coordinator and the 
principal's secretary. In addition, 
translation services are provided by 
parent volunteers and/or the DOE 
translation unit if other languages are 
needed. Also, the written DOE forms 
and letters translated into most 
languages from the website are 
downloaded and used.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

We will have two parent teacher 
conferences in November and March as 
well as a Curriculum Night in September. 
Oral translation/interpretation services are 
required primarily for individual parent 
conferences, meetings and assemblies, 
and for the School Messenger services. We 
are fortunate to be able to depend on in-
house translators/interpreters, since many 
of the teachers, guidance counselors, and 
school aides speak both English and 
Spanish. For SLT meetings, a translation 
device is used. For the students who speak 
languages other than English, the services 
of parent volunteers or the translation unit 
at the DOE will be utilized.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

A written copy of the "The Parent Bill of Rights" is provided at the first SLT and Parent Association meeting of each 
term. In addition, a copy of this document is mailed in the appropriate language to all parents in September. 
Everything described above fulfills Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 for parental notification  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The parent coordinator will gather feedback from the parents who speak languages other than Spanish by making 
individual contact and using the services of the DOE Translation unit if needed. The Spanish spaking parents will be 
asked to fill out a survey regarding translation services during the last PA meeting of each semester.
