Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The staff and parents of M.S. 379Q work collaboratively, as partners, in developing knowledgeable young adults who 
are motivated leaders who learn and grow as individuals by engaging in a hands-on learning approach. We empower 
students to become active, compassionate lifelong learners by engaging in project based learning focused on solving 
real world problems. Our students acquire the knowledge and academic skills and experiences necessary to preserve 
the environment and to be productive members of our local community and global society in a safe, secure learning 
environment. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

M.S. 379 is located in College Point Queens. It is a Middle School that will house approximately 500 students at 
capacity in September 2020, with six classes on each grade level, including an ICT and 12:1, from 6th Grade to 8th 
Grade. M.S. 379 is opening to alleviate the overcrowding at neighboring Middle Schools 185 and 194. Based on 
historical data from the priority seating elementary schools of P.S. 129 and P.S. 29, their school population on average 
comprises of 1% Black, 57% Hispanic, 11% White, and 30% Asian and <1% American Indian students. Their student 
body includes 25% English language learners and 15% special education students. Given that M.S. 379 will have 
priority seating to these two elementary schools, we can conclude that our demographics will be similar. 

 

M.S. 379 will have a focus on preserving the environment. In order to support this focus, partnerships with a local 
Marine Biologist, The Harbor High School, and The Billion Oyster Project will take place to teach students about their 
environment and how they can support the preservation of their community. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

For the 2018-2019 school year, we have six 6th grade classes, which include one ICT and one 12:1 class setting. The 
ICT setting provides a collaborative teaching environment that fosters the supportive environment for students both 
academically and socio-emotionally. These are essential factors for meeting academic excellence on the sixth grade 
level. We are also providing a supportive environment for ENL students to meet the rigorous expectations of the 
Standards. The ENL students are being supported by a full-time ENL teacher who provides services to all ENL students 
through collaboration and planning with the classroom teachers. By implementing small group instruction, scaffolding 
tasks, giving frequent clarifications on tasks, and extended time as needed on tasks, the ENL teacher will support 
students to be engaged in their own learning. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As a new school, our key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be around rigorous instruction. Teachers and 
parents will receive professional learning to support rigorous instruction and work together to ensure students are 
engaged in learning. Students will learn to make meaning for themselves, impose structure on information, take skills 
and put them together to create a process, and apply what they have learned to new and novel situations. As a new 
school our instructional focus is: R.I.S.E.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on fourth grade data provided to us on SEMS, 50.98% of incoming students were level 1 and 2's on the NYS 
Mathematics Exam. Aligning to the district's need to prepare students for algebra readiness by 8th grade in the year 
2021 and the data provided to us, there is a need to focus on rigorous mathematics instruction. In order to prepare 
students for algebra readiness, we need to develop units of study that align to the next generation mathematics 
standards and incorporate algebra readiness skills into teaching and learning at M.S. 379Q. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will plan for and implement rigorous Math instruction by engaging in the Algebra for All Initiative and 
planning a minimum of two units of study aligned to the Next Generation Standards as measured by a 5% growth of our 
students on the New York State Mathematics Exam from 54.78% level 3's and 4's in 2018 to 59.78% in 2019.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Our mathematics teacher will attend a three-week professional 
development training course, Algebra for All, over the summer 
to learn about algebra readiness strategies they can use in their 
classrooms to enhance their instruction. They will utilize what 
they learned to plan two units of study aligned to the Next 
Generation Standards in order to engage students in learning. An 
Algebra for All staff developer will be working with our teachers 
four days throughout the year to help them plan for their 
instruction. 

Our teachers will utilize a 3L’s approach in mathematics to 
address the needs of their English Language Learners and 
Students with Disabilities by planning close reading strategies of 
complex word problems to engage students in learning. This 
close reading of complex word problems includes reading to get 
the gist, reading a second time to annotate and sketch what they 
are visualizing, and finally, reading a third time to solve the 
problem. For English Language Learners, there will be a focus on 
vocabulary building with mathematics language visual with 
classroom word walls and activities such as word play including 
lexical arrays. Students will learn how to deconstruct word 
problems.

environment. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will create a safe and supportive environment by implementing Yale Center for Emotional 
Intelligence RULER Program with all stakeholders and incorporating them into our school’s curricula as measured by 
100% participation of teachers, staff, students, and parents.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In order to support Social and Emotional Development and 
Learning (SEDL) implementation across the building, a teacher in 
charge of student advisory will receive RULER training. The 
teacher, guidance and administrator will meet monthly to look at 
data and plan for the strengthening of our PBIS system, as well as 
develop protocols and systems for students with high-risk 
behaviors. The teacher will collaborate with the guidance 
counselor to create professional development based on RULER 
training and other research and evidence-based practices to be 
delivered to school faculty. In addition, the teacher will meet 
with each class weekly to implement restorative circles. As a 
school community we will come up with a vision for Social 
Emotional Learning. 

Strategies that will be put into place to address the needs of 
students with disabilities, ELLs, and other high need student 
subgroups include taking a "Meta-Moment," to take a step back 
from a situation in order to apply a strategy so that actions 
reflect their best self, such as mindfulness, breathing exercises, 
or other wellness activities. Students will also use the Mood 
Meter tool to effectively identify and label emotions in order to 
develop the self-awareness needed to inform their choices.

on the area of 3C of the Danielson Rubric and will be 
differentiated based on teacher needs. 

Administration in collaborations with classroom teachers will 
utilize data to examine trends and plan and implement 
professional development opportunities on Summer Professional 
Learning Days, Chancellor Conference days, and non-attendance 
days. Administration will monitor progress through informal 
visitations and formal observations and student assessment 
data. Teachers will plan for instruction based on data, specifically 
targeting instruction for our English Language Learners and 
Students with Disabilities, and adjust Professional Learning 
according to findings. Professional Learning will take place 
around planning for rigorous, engaging, differentiated units of 
study that address individual student needs and allow for high-
level cognitive thinking through a wide range of pedagogical 
approaches.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By November 2018, all teachers will have completed their initial conferences and will have met with their supervisor 
for at least one evaluation feedback session. By March 2019, 100% of teachers will be utilizing supervisor feedback to 
drive instruction, plan interventions and provide enrichment to support each child’s learning. Staff members will 
display evidence throughout the school-year of an increased focus on Domain 3C by planning rigorous units of studies 
for students that integrate basic and higher levels of thinking, differentiating lessons for individual learners, and 
accessing a variety of pedagogical approaches to engage students in learning.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
In order to monitor progress, we will use observations specifically looking at Danielson's Framework for teaching,

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a new school there is a need to build strong family community ties and create parent engagement activities 
throughout the year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will create strong family-community ties with all stakeholders by using an in house survey to parents 
on the educational environment and creating opportunities for parents to take on roles in ongoing improvement efforts 
as measured by an in house survey given a minimum of two times during the year.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will support parents’ and guardians’ understanding of 
the Standards providing workshops to families, as a part of a 
classroom visitation, Tuesday Parent Engagement Time, evening 
PTA workshops and P/T conferences. Translation will be 
provided for families to meet the needs of our parents and an 
increase in parent attendance at school events will occur. 
Parents will be encouraged to attend performances and 
celebration throughout the school year. Parents will gain a 
better understanding of the physical, social and emotional 
aspects children display when they attend school-wide events. 
School tours will be provided for incoming students to get a 
better understanding of the foundational skills students will 
need for the following year in order for their child to be 
successful. 

Teachers will communicate with all parents via school 
newsletters, PTA meetings, school wide events, phone outreach, 
Parent Teacher Conferences, and Parent workshops, ways in 
which parents can support their children at home. Teachers will 
differentiate their communication with ENL and SWD parents to 
include additional supports parents can use at home. We will 
partner with outside community groups such as the Billion 
Oyster Project, Coastal Preservation Network in order to build 
the physical, social, and emotional aspects of all children and 
help teach English in an engaging way to English Language 
Learners.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in 
DOE systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

At this time, 
we do not 
have that 
information. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

School staff who become aware of any student who is or may be a homeless student and who needs assistance 
contacts the Student in Temporary Housing Liaison. Parents receive information sheets (McKinney-Vento Act Guide 
for Parents) that set forth the basic rights of homeless students when they are registered. These information sheets 
are available, in the office of the STH Liaison. Parents also receive a Residency Questionnaire Form to all newly 
enrolled students and students who change their addresses during the school year. We enter information that a 
student is homeless into ATS in the student’s bio page and update changes as appropriate. We do our best to support 
parents in regular attendance of homeless children as it is of paramount importance. If a student has sporadic 
attendance, we contact the parent and the Family Assistant and/or Student in Temporary Housing Liaison to identify 
services that may be needed or whether alternative schooling arrangements should be arranged. Per Chancellor’s 
Regulation A-810, students residing in temporary housing are eligible to receive free school meals. Money is set aside 
to help students in temporary houses afford school supplies and trips.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. College Point Collaborative, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Teacher Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.  

 

College Point Collaborative will support parents and families of Title I students by:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The formative assessments used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs include TCRWP Running Records, teacher-created 
math assessments, teacher-created science and social studies pre and post assessments. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers meet during subject area common planning time, Monday's professional learning time and Tuesday's teacher team 
time in order to create assessments, look at data, and plan for instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The summative assessments used to baseline and benchmark assessments are TCRWP Running Records, teacher-created math 
assessments, teacher-created science and social studies pre and post assessments. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers meet during subject area common planning time, Monday's professional learning time and Tuesday's teacher team 
time in order to look at data, and plan for instruction.  Students are provided with academic intervention services during a 
professional period if they data shows they require additional interventions to achieve academic success. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The NYCDOE RTI model is based on three tiers of instruction and intervention support. Tier 1 is the instructional core that is 
intended to incorporate high quality evidence-based instruction for all students. The NYSESLAT data is used to identify our 
current English Language Learners and provide them with the required number of minutes through Stand Alone ENL and or 
Integrated ENL.  After that, students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive 
academic support. Our Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is tailored to meet our ELLs' language needs based on students' language 
proficiency by modality, incorporating research-based intervention strategies.  As required by State law, when a student enters 
a NYC public school for the first time, a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is completed. After parents answer the 
survey questions, our ENL teacher determines the student eligibility to take the NYSITELL to determine the student's English 
Language Proficiency level.  If an ELL student is struggling and performing below benchmark, the student receives targeted 
instructional support to bolster development in a particular area of need.  We believe that strengthening classroom instruction 
is a key step in supporting our at-risk ELLs. In order to support our ELLs , our school creates high-quality instructional 
environments that foster academic success. Our teachers encourage students to engage with each other in conversations on 
rigorous academic content. Not only our ENL teachers, but also classroom teachers develop our ELLs language and literacy 
skills across the curriculum.  Teachers provide high quality instruction by linking students' background knowledge to the 
content at hand.  ELLs who continue struggling receive intensive, and targeted intervention. Teachers monitor the ELLs 
progress by collecting data periodically to make educational decisions about changes, goals, instruction and services.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessment data used to evalutate and inform our ELL programs include the NYSESLAT, the ELL Data Analysis 
Tool, the RLAT, and the NYS ELA and Math exams.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teacher shares with all staff members the NYSESLAT results on the first day teachers reported to school. In order to 
ensure clarity, the ENL teacher creates an Excel spreadsheet that includes all students in the school including ELLs and former 
ELLs. The spreadsheet also includes the language proficiency level for each student.  All teachers received their students' 
performance on the NYSESLAT including classroom teachers as well as out of classroom teachers.   The ENL teacher also 
identified students at risk and shares the findings with classroom teachers.  Administrators and teachers engage in 
conversations about best practices and appropriate scaffolds to support our struggling English Language Learners across 
grades.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).

Instruction for ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program is delivered by either dually certified teachers who have TESOL 
and common branch or by certified TESOL teachers. Our ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program receive instruction 
based on their NYSITELL or NYSESLAT performance level.  Our Entering ELLs receive a total of 360 minutes per week 
that includes 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL, and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL.  Our Emerging students receive a 
total of 360 minutes per week that includes 90 minutes of Stand Alone ENL, 180 minutes of Integrated ENL and 
flexible 90 minutes with Stand Alone ENL or Integrated ENL.  Our Transitioning students receive a total of 180 minutes 
per week that includes 90 minutes of Integrated ENL and either 90 minutes with Stand Alone ENL or 90 minutes of 
Integrated ENL.  Our Expanding students receive a total of  180 minutes per week that includes 180 minutes of 
Integrated ENL.  Our former ELLs receive a total of 90 minutes per week of Integrated ENL for two additional years 
after they test proficient on the NYSESLAT.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Once students are placed in classrooms, the ENL teacher groups students by class based on their language performance level. 
The ENL teacher designs their program card that meets the needs of each student based on his/her language performance 
level. Once program cards are created the Administration reviews the number of instructional minutes to ensure meeting the 
state mandates for each student. The administration periodically reviews ENL teachers' program cards to ensure all new 
admits and transfers are programmed correctly throughout the school year.  Students are then programmed in STARs to 
ensure correct number of minutes per student.  The ENL instructional minutes are delivered in the Freestanding ENL program 
in alignment with the Next Generation Standards in ELA and Math and the Science and Social Studies scope and sequence.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
During our school day, we focus on providing our ELLs with rigorous instruction in all content areas the Next Generation 
Standards.  All ELLs receive the full amount of NYS mandated ENL minutes of service.  We further support our teachers with 
professional development in best practices to address the needs of our ELLs.  Our teachers professional development focuses 
on building academic language, unpacking complex texts, comparing informational and fictional texts, and engaging in rigorous 
academic conversations amongst students.  Additionally, teachers have been focusing on close reading of text by asking text 
dependent and author's craft questions where students are engaged in reading complex and compelling text with a focus. 
Teachers also are helping students to self reflect on their own learning and development through the use of student friendly 
rubrics and checklists.  Our ENL teacher use English as the language of instruction.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

In order to ensure appropriate evaluation to our new admits who did not pass the NYSITELL whose home language is Spanish, 
we administer the Spanish LAB-R to determine their language proficiency level in Spanish.  Additionally throughout the year, 
tests are translated in students native language based on students' language proficiency.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

a. Currently, we do not have any SIFE students.   b. In order to better support our newcomers, our school will provide small 
group targeted instruction Reading and Writing Workshop.  Also, our school provides students with picture dictionaries, 
glossaries, and visual support during lessons.  Additionally, ELL students receive testing translations during state exams, i.e. 
during Math State Assessments.  Our teachers use the Total Physical Response with our newcomers.  Our ENL teacher and 
classroom teachers are also trained on the 3Ls approach to learning by Maryann Cucchiara (Learning, Language and 
Literacy).  As our teachers dive into the content, they conduct their own research about the topics they plan to teach by 
selecting appropriate articles, books, and videos to enhance their own learning.  Teachers plan activities to unpack the 
language where they land on juicy sentences, explain Tier II and Tier III vocabulary to support students' learning.  Finally, 
teachers craft text dependent and author's craft questions where students engage in meaningful conversations about the 
topic.    c. To better support our developing ELLs, our teachers use technology to build on our ELLs' prior knowledge and to 
deepen their understanding.  Our teachers practice using Multidisciplinary approach to meet the needs of our students' 
various learning styles including visual, auditory and tactile learners.  Thinking Maps, sentence frames and word play activities 
are all utilized to build on our ELLs academic language across multiple disciplines.  Our ENL teacher and classroom teachers are 
also trained on the 3Ls approach to learning by Maryann Cucchiara (Learning, Language and Literacy).  As our teachers dive 
into the content, they conduct their own research about the topics they plan to teach by selecting appropriate articles, books, 
and videos to enhance their own learning.  Teachers plan activities to unpack the language where they land on juicy sentences, 
explain Tier II and Tier III vocabulary to support students' learning.  Finally, teachers craft text dependent and author's craft 
questions where students engage in meaningful conversations about the topic.    d. Our ELL students that have been receiving 
services for 4 to 6 years are supported by their classroom teachers, ENL service provider, as well as, an AIS teacher.  Our 
teachers use the Total Physical Response and technology to activate students' prior knowledge and to increase their 
engagement to better support our long term ELLs.  Our teachers also use the 3Ls approach as well as a multidisciplinary 
approach to meet the needs of our long term ELLs.  Our long term ELLs use Thinking Maps regularly to organize their thinking 
before sharing with a partner or before writing.   e. We also take into consideration our ELLs who reached the Commanding 
level on the NYSESLAT and provide a total of 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction for two additional years.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers plan activities where students engage in discussions using sentence frames to gain a deeper insight into a 
topic.  Teachers plan word play activities allowing students time to engage in group discussions around Tier II and Tier III 
vocabulary.   Linguistic frames are used regularly when students engage in discussions and when they write to ensure that 
students share their ideas in complete sentences. Students also have access to classroom leveled libraries covering fiction and 
non-fiction genres across different levels from which they can choose books on their appropriate level that interest 
them.  Instruction is differentiated for all students including ELL-SWDs.  Teachers use strategies such as flexible grouping so 
students have different partners to learn from.  Teachers plan to use different learning materials such as video clips and visuals 
to build on students' prior knowledge.  Students have access to hands-on manipulatives and teacher made tool-kits to increase 
students' independence.  In addition, teachers ensure that classrooms are print rich with anchor charts, labels, and students' 
work to support students' learning. Teachers are provided with in-house and outside professional development on strategies 
to teach the ELL-SWDs.  Strategies such as front loading, deconstructing “Juicy Sentences” and digging into complex texts have 
been modeled for teachers to assist them in supporting their ELL-SWDs with making sense of texts and developing 
vocabulary.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All service providers of ELL-SWDs collaboratively discuss schedules and instruction to minimize conflicts between mandated 
services and instruction.  Students receive ENL services through a push-in model where the ENL provider might team teach 
with the classroom teacher or the ENL provider works with a small group based on students' needs.  Teachers choose different 
models daily based on students' needs. The team teaching model enables ELL-SWDs to work alongside their classmates and 
participates in differentiated group tasks regardless of their disabilities.  Some ELL-SWDs receive services daily in a 12:1 setting 
based on their IEPs. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention programs during our school day, include a focus on rigorous instruction in the content areas 
including science, social studies and Math.  All ELLs receive the full amount of NYS mandated ENL minutes of service.  We 
further support our teachers with professional development through professional learning cycles, as well as, team 
meetings.  ENL teacher meets with classroom teachers during Tuesday Teacher Time for planning. During these meetings, 
techniques and strategies are presented and modeled for the teachers to assist them in supporting their ELLs during content 
area instruction within the classroom. With this support, teachers are able to differentiate instruction in their classrooms by 
using various strategies such as; pairing, modeling, bridging, using visuals as well as anchor charts, allowing students to turn 
and talk using sentence frames.  Also, landing on juicy sentences and identifying linguistic frames. Supporting each student to 
build vocabulary and providing students with leveled library books for independent reading.   Additionally, our teachers utilize 
multiple points of entry using Smart boards, laptops and classroom computers to support our tactile and visual ELLs.  Our ENL 
teacher also push in during ELA, Math and content area instruction, to work with their students using differentiated materials 
and supplementing the curriculum. Students are encouraged to use bilingual glossaries and dictionaries to aid them in 
language understanding and build independence.  We also provide services to our ELLs who have scored proficient on the 
NYSESLAT over the past two years. Former ELLs that are transitioning are taken into consideration individually and are given 
support through small group instruction.  ENL teachers work with small groups where they engage in guided reading or 
strategy groups based on students' needs. All intervention programs are offered in English. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data and trends we will consider a Newcomer program for our entering and emerging ENL students to support their 
language acquisition.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

NA 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs through parent meetings, flyers sent home translated, and newsletters 
(also translated).  We currently do not have any after-school or supplemental services for ELLs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All classrooms have Promethean Boards to support all students including our ELLs by allowing students to access a multitude of 
online resources.  In addition, all teachers received laptops to integrate more technology into their classrooms.  Students have 
access to content specific complex texts in their classroom libraries.  We also purchased Passport for social studies units to 
support our newcomers and developing ELLs.  Each unit has multiple visuals texts and activities. Also, there are links to videos 
and poems to support students' learning.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our ENL program, home language support is used as a scaffold based on students' needs.  Some of our teachers are bilingual 
to support students across grades based on their needs.  In our ENL program Home Language support is assessed during 
conferencing if the teacher is bilingual.  Some students can speak in their home language but can not read or write in that 
home language.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

In order to ensure all required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels teachers select 
compelling, complex, and coherent text sets in fiction and non fiction when planning based on the needs of their 
students.  Teacher land on different parts of the text where students engage in discussions around author's craft which helps 
teachers determine the appropriateness of the text selected.  Teachers plan different scaffolds using the text to increase 
students' engagement including but not limited to front loading, videos, word play activities, purposeful turn and talk as they 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

share their learning using linguistic frames.  We believe in supporting all students to reach the expected standards by providing 
them with age appropriate scaffolds and access points to increase their engagement and understanding.  Our teachers do not 
teach literacy in isolation but they teach it as they teach content areas.  Our ENL teacher meets with the classroom teachers to 
plan different activities to support our ELLs based on their needs.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
NA 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
To assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year an ENL licensed teacher identifies the 
parent's/guardian's preferred language of communication, and newcomers are interviewed about their interests to better 
support them.  Once students are admitted to our school we introduce to them key staff members including school 
secretaries, school aids, and guidance counselors.  As parents enter our building, we have a bulletin board that has pictures of 
all staff members so students and parents become familiar with them.  Once students are admitted, key staff members are 
introduced by referring to the pictures on the staff bulletin board.  By late May and the beginning of June we arrange for 
orientation where the school principal, guidance counselor, ENL provider, and the school secretary meet with parents and go 
over important information for the following school year.  Upon enrollment one of our staff members accompanies the parent 
and the child on a school tour showing them different parts of our school building.  Parents are invited to a school open house 
to meet our staff and administration at the beginning of the school year to learn more about College Point Collaborative 
School.  During all meetings, translators are available to support our parents.  In order to support our new students, classroom 
teachers partner new admits with other students who speak their home language to ease the transition.  These students' 
partnerships support new students' smooth transition to our school.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

NA 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

NA 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teachers and staff are considered teachers of ELLs.  Our ENL teacher meets with classroom teachers for planning. During 
these meetings, techniques and strategies are presented and modeled for teachers to assist them in supporting their ELLs 
during content area instruction with language development in alignment with the standards.  Our teachers receive on site 
support from Teachers College staff developers in reading and writing as they model different strategies to support all of our 
students including ELLs.  Our teachers also attend professional developments at TC calendar days based on their needs.  A 
Teacher’s College staff developer meets with our teachers multiple dates for workshops and to model lessons.  Teachers 
receive professional development with Maryann Cucchiara on engaging students in vocabulary rich conversations, rigorous 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

tasks and building academic language in the content areas, as well as, exploring juicy sentences (deconstructing and 
reconstructing) for meaning.  As a school we also focus on selecting appropriate text sets that is not only complex but also 
compelling to our students.  Professional development is provided on the Framework for Teaching.  Our Administration meets 
with staff regularly to provide them with effective feedback after formal and informal observation to better support all of our 
students including ELLs and former ELLs as well as students with disabilities.  Ongoing professional development is offered to 
all teachers to support them in aligning their unit and lesson plans to the standards with a focus on language standards.  Our 
school secretary receives training on how to support our new parents when they enroll or transfer their children to our school.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 by providing our teachers a total of 15% of 
their professional learning dedicated to addressing the needs of ELL learners.  We dedicate 6 sessions of our 35 Monday 
Professional Learning to our focus on the 3L's approach to teacher ELL students.  Included in these sessions will be a focus on 
deconstructing text with a focus on language function, linguistic frames and differentiate word play to increase vocabulary and 
deepen understanding of the content.  Teachers will plan close reading questions to focus on authors craft and language 
choice.  We learned about this approach through our sessions with Maryann Cucchiara, an ELL specialist.  Agendas and 
attendance is collected during these meetings.  In order to meet the 50% professional development for our ENL teacher, in 
addition to the 8 sessions above, they meet for an additional 11 sessions to focus on the 3L's approach.  These teacher looks at 
NYSELAT and NYSITELL data to plan for instruction.  Additionally, we have 4 days scheduled with Maryann Cucchiara where we 
collaborate with another school to implement the 3L's Approach to teaching ELL students.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In the beginning of the school year, our ENL teacher with the support of our bilingual staff call parents and schedule times to 
meet with parents individually to discuss the goals of our ELL students.   Teachers refer to the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL, as well 
as, current formal or informal running records to identify each student's strengths and areas of need.  During the annual 
individual meetings, our ENL teacher explains to parents their child's current language development strengths and needs, as 
well as, strategies to support their learning at home.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We offer different ELL parent workshops such as supporting your child with close reading.  Parent orientation meetings are 
ongoing to inform our new parents about their rights and the rights of their children as ELLs.  We explain to our ELL parents the 
different language programs and the intended outcome for each program so they can make an educated decision.  We invite 
our ELL parents to attend our monthly PTA meetings which are focused on engaging and rigorous learning experiences that 
include parent and child participation.  We communicate with parents based on their preferred language of oral and written 
communication.  Translations are provided at our PTA meetings to increase parents' engagement. Our school's website is 
updated to include translated monthly newsletters, school updates and activities.  Every effort is made to ensure that all 
communication sent home is translated in the parent's preferred home language. Translated report cards are also sent home 
to parents.  Each grade in our school designs a monthly newsletter that includes what students will learn in each content area, 
as well as how parents can support at home and important monthly events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Renee Klager, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At M.S. 379 a variety of data collection tools is used to assess our school’s written translation and oral 
interpretation needs to be able to provide all parents with timely information in a language that they can 
understand. In order to determine the written translation needs of our school’s population, we use the Home 
Language Identification Survey, which is distributed at the time of a student’s registration, surveys from teachers, 
and the ATS RSEC, RHLA and RSDS reports. Our oral interpretation needs are assessed through PTA meetings, 
Parent/Child Workshops, Parent Teacher Conferences, the School Leadership Team, and the Home Language 
Identification Survey.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Interpretations are provided by in-house school staff. In order to communicate with the large multilingual population 
of M.S. 379 more efficiently and effectively, we will hire staff members at per session rate to interpret in multiple 
languages. Staff members will be hired to translate at after school parent workshops, and morning and evening parent 
activities, in order to effectively communicate to parents about school wide concerns, curriculum issues, and answer 
parent’s questions. School flyers are translated into Spanish as often as possible and sent home.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our administration shares with all staff how to reach out to the language and interpretation unit in case we need 
someone to interpret and no one is available at school. Copies will be provided to all staff that answers the following 
questions: How can I get a document translated? How can I get over-the-phone interpretation services? Where can I 
find additional resources?  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents

Our welcome poster is placed by our school's entrance by the security desk and in the main office. Our parents' Bill of 
Rights will be provided to all parents whose primary language is a covered language and who require language 
assistance services. The Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities includes parents' rights regarding translation and 
interpretation services. We will also place parents' Guide to Language Access poster by our school's primary entrance 
to inform parents of the covered languages or most prominent covered languages of interpretation services. Our 
security desk will have a copy of the Language ID Guide and also a copy will be placed in the main office.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to continue improving our translation and interpretation systems we will reach out to parents who attend our 
Parent Teacher Association meetings, as well as, our School Leadership Team members to identify areas of strengths 
and next steps.
