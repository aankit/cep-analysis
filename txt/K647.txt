Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission:  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Metropolitan DP HS is a learning community where adults are committed to supporting students' potential as they 
reconnect to education and embark on paths filled with opportunity. Metropolitan’s focus is to make academics 
relevant through real world experience and offer challenges that provide knowledge, choice, and positive 
outcomes. Activities are facilitated to expand their career and college opportunities.  
Our Vision:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The Metropolitan Diploma Plus High School community shares the passion and vision of successfully addressing the 
needs of the over-aged, under-credited youth. We aim to reach young people who face personal, educational, and 
economic challenges which make success in a traditional high school setting difficult. We recognize our students’ 
potential and challenge ourselves to build a learning community to support their efforts as they reconnect to their 
educational aspirations. Our school will address both the academic, emotional and social needs of transfer school 
students. 

The primary goal of Metropolitan Diploma Plus High School is to graduate students who are career and college 
ready, that is, prepared with the habits of mind and skills to thrive in a dynamic and competitive labor market. This 
instructional model will be supported through the principles of Youth Development: caring and trusting 
relationships with adults and other young people, high expectations, youth participation, and engaging learning 
experiences in and outside of the classroom. 
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As a transfer school, we are a small, academically rigorous high school designed to re-engage students who have 
dropped out or are over-age and under-credited for their grade level. Our school is designed to create a personalized 
learning environment and provide connections to college or other post-secondary options. Students graduate with a 
High School Regents Diploma and a firm post-secondary plan. 

Our partnership with New York City Mission Society: New York City Mission Society’s Learning to Work (LTW) program 
supports students in their studies and prepares them for success in college and the work world. The LTW program 
provides four main services: 1) student support, including counseling, workshops, tutoring, and cultural activities; 2) 
college guidance and preparation; 3) job skills development and career exploration; and 4) supported internships. The 
principles of youth development are what make transfer schools and their partnership programs successful with the 
population of disconnected youth. At a transfer school, youth development is infused in the educational and training 
programs. Some of the key principles of youth development practices include: relationships with caring adults, 
supportive environments that value youth voice and opportunities for youth to contribute. This approach views youth 
as assets, rather than deficits and instills a sense of hope in young people who previously have been underserved or 
overlooked by the traditional system. Using youth development principles as the building blocks of education allows 
for young people and their needs to drive the organization and structure. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special populations at MDPHS include: Special Education students, ELL students, and Level 1 and 2 students. Their 
needs include addressing: their disengagement, diverse knowledge gaps, avoidance of academic interaction with 
teachers and peers, a wide range of reading levels, their sense of isolation, a fixed mindset, and poor reading habits. 

We can address our students' needs by pinpointing their gaps and providing targeted feedback. Students receive 
targeted instruction with digital supports to work through challenges. We establish a safe learning community to build 
productive relationships while supporting academic growth. We keep class size low, along with incorporating small-
group learning which gives students the tools to develop bonds with the teacher and the class through goal-centered 
collaboration. We promote interpersonal skills with blended learning in specialized programs which promote curiosity 
and connections needed for use in college and careers as well. We teach and reinforce growth mindset across all 
content areas, along with celebrating persistence of students as they engage in a wide range of digital activities, 
whole group learning, independent reading, small group instruction, and student application activities. This can be 
accomplished by embedding the workshop model of literacy across all classrooms to address the needs of all levels of 
students. 

Daily, students complete a choice of two Do Now/motivational activities to start the class after completing the arrival 
procedures to build routines and continuity of engagement in instruction. There is a share out portion of the period - 
embedding a discussion technique like a Turn and Talk. Our special populations work in differentiated stations to build 
the area/skill at which they struggle. Students engage in the writing process by analyzing exemplars and then drafting,

writing, and revising their written work while incorporating actionable feedback from peers and teachers. The 
development of vocabulary is addressed with our special populations through the use of the incorporation of the 
DOE’s Word Work and Word Play activities in vocabulary stations across all content areas.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that our school has made the most progress in over the past year 
include: Collaborative Teachers and Rigorous Instruction  

Collaborative Teachers: Our school has a current structure with activities in place to inform professional 
collaborations. Teachers participate in daily common planning time with interdepartmental staff and others 
outside their discipline. All common planning time meetings are documented and shared in the school’s Google 
Drive folder. In addition to full staff professional development sessions, by using the Google Drive folder, all staff is 
able to learn about the work happening across teams. Teams also share documents that have been created and 
others can give feedback. Some of the documents may include: lesson plans, unit plans, curriculum maps, graphic 
organizers, and scaffolds. Content-area teachers meet regularly and teachers meet across the disciplines as well. 
For instance, social studies and science teachers plan with English department teachers to align theme, text, and 
focus-skills. Within the common planning time, various activities occur depending upon their place in the inquiry 
cycle. For instance, teachers follow a cycle of inquiry during the week in which they are examining different 
components of planning, resource development, implementation, and reflection. Within the cycle of inquiry, 
teachers also examine student work by using a protocol to evaluate strengths and deficiencies. Teachers generally 
select three students (low, medium, high skill level) to examine during the week. Teachers then use this data to 
drive instruction, which is evident in unit plans, lesson plans, and other teacher created materials that are posted 
and shared in Google Drive. This is one way in which our school is able to ensure the effectiveness of teacher teams 
and monitor its impact on student progress. 
Rigorous Instruction: Across classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set 
of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the Danielson Framework for Teaching and the 
instructional shifts. The school believes that if students cannot learn the way we teach, then we must teach the 
way they learn. The school’s instructional focus emphasizes reading and writing grounded in evidence from text. 
With this in mind, teacher practices take into consideration multiple entry points, supports, and extensions for a 
diverse group of learners. Classroom structures and routines are also similar in order to create coherence for our 
students. All classrooms have exemplars, process bulletin boards, learning walls, make-up stations, anchor charts 
for reference, etc. Teachers have also collaborated to promote teaching strategies aligned with our schools focus 
and the Danielson Framework. Some of these strategies include the use of the CEI (Claim Evidence Interpretation), 
QFT (Question Formulation Technique), Accountable Talk Prompts and Metacognitive Stems. These strategies give 
students the tools they need to develop the speaking and listening techniques necessary for larger class discussions 
in addition to justifying their responses with evidence and writing argumentative essays. 

Additionally, teachers use common instructional practices to promote high levels of student thinking and 
participation. This instructional coherence is important to supporting students in achieving success and a sense of 
understanding of what they are learning. Informed by Danielson (3B), teachers use varying questioning and 
discussion techniques to encourage all students to participate. Teachers have worked collaboratively to develop 
strategies to teach speaking and listening skills in order for students to prepare for larger whole class discussion 
formats, including, a Socratic Seminar, Speed Share, Inner/Outer Circle. Asking questions and participating in 
discussions allows students to think, reflect, deepen their understanding, and challenge their ideas against those of 
their classmates. As a result, student work products and discussions exhibit high levels of thinking. Students 
participate and demonstrate ownership of their learning by using metacognitive and accountable talk stems. 
Teacher capacity is built to promote rigorous level discussions and tasks with coaching support, intervisitations, 
and with teacher-developed metacognitive stems.

Our school’s key area of focus for this school year will be Strong Family Community Ties . We have dedicated a part 
of our school’s computer lab to house a Parent/Community Center. The space has been configured to provide 
parents a place to use resources for themselves and their families. In addition to books, resources include 
computers, printers, internet access, fax machine and copier. Our goal was to create a space with the appropriate 
resources to support parents on their own journeys. Teenagers often desire to be treated as adults with 
independence; however, as adults, we know that they still need guidance. It is essential to understand that as 
teenagers on their path to young adulthood, schools and families must work together to build a foundation that is 
embedded in our school’s culture. The space itself will make parent visits daily and positive to the school 
community. We are pleased with this investment and will continually be rewarded with significant growth in 
parent participation at our school and in their children’s lives. We plan to host workshops through our 
collaboration with New York City Mission Society for families. 

Engagement will be the key to planning, implementing, and sustaining Strong Family Community Ties. The 
engagement of parents, staff, and the community will increase buy-in, and in turn, more success will be achieved. 
Research shows that ways to engage low-income families is by understanding and directly responding to their 
needs, interests, and economic realities. By engaging parents, staff and the community, there is the opportunity to 
improve student achievement and social skills/behavior which will lead to an increased likelihood of high school 
graduation and a viable post-secondary plan. Our C.B.O. (NYC Mission Society) will present family engagement 
workshops and dinners for parents and children to have meaningful conversations around the table. These 
workshops may take place at PTA monthly meetings or other times that are convenient to parents. The ultimate 
goal of engagement is to involve families in the academic lives of their children. In order to build the kind of 
relationships that engage parents as true active partners, it is important to have open, ongoing communication. 
Feedback and reflection will benefit the work of the program in order to ensure the needs of the community are 
being addressed. It is crucial that Strong Family-Community Ties are built and sustained.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: Feedback from the 2017-2018 PPO visits found that teachers align curriculum to the Common Core 
Learning Standards, strategically integrate the instructional shifts, and ensure ongoing refinement and revision of 
their curricula and academic tasks through analyzing student work and data.  

Needs: According to the regents data for 2016-2017, 81.8% of students scored a 65 or higher on the ELA regents 
exam. [Data source: Regents scores for ELA exams in January 2017, June 2017, and August 2017.] According to the 
January and June 2018 regents data, only 66.7% of our students scored 65 or higher on the ELA regents exam. [Data 
source: Regents exam scores for ELA in January and June 2018.] This shows that although the school ensures that 
curriculum is aligned to Common Core Learning Standards, many of our students struggled with academic vocabulary 
and comprehension of complex texts as they work towards being college and career ready. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Boosting Academic Vocabulary and Comprehension of Complex Texts:  

By June 2019, 100% of students will demonstrate increased fluency of academic vocabulary, and the percentage of 
students scoring 65 or higher on the June CC ELA regents will increase by 5% compared to the scores on the CC ELA 
regents in the 2017-2018 SY.

(September 26 and May 9), PTA meetings (3rd Monday of every Month), Saturday Academy (December 1, 8, 15; 
January 6, 13, 20; April 27, May 4, 11, 18; June 1, 8) and other school visits about teaching practices aligned with the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Our staff will share our school's beliefs about how students learn best aligned with 
the instructional shifts. We will invite our parents/families to Monthly Parent Learning Walks from October to May so 
our parents/families have opportunities to visit classrooms and observe our students engaged in higher order learning 
activities. Our staff will discuss and share curriculum maps and benchmark assessments across the content areas with 
families to support their understanding of rigorous instruction and the Common Core.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths : We have built caring and trusting relationships with our students so they feel connected to our school. 
We recognize that our students need to “re-engage” or “re-connect” on their educational paths. As indicated on the 
2017-2018 School Survey, 91% of students agreed or strongly agreed that most adults at our school treat them with 
respect. (Data source: 2017-2018 NYC DOE School Survey.) At some point in their high school journey, students 
became “disengaged” and “disconnected” - which commonly leads to chronic absenteeism, failed classes, and a 
general overwhelming , self-defeating attitude toward ever finishing high school. We are aware of our students’ 
past experiences and that we must support them in re-connecting our students to their education. 
Needs: When struggling with a difficult task, teachers witness our population of students often give up rather than 
take on the challenge and persevere. Part of teaching at a transfer school includes teaching students the tools to 
overcome challenges. By understanding that their abilities and intelligence are capable of growth, overage and 
under-credited students can work together with their teachers to support productive struggle in the classroom to 
develop growth mindsets. We aim to develop practices to help students reduce their fear of making mistakes and 
begin to see those mistakes as valuable opportunities for learning. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Developing a Growth Mindset 

By June 2019, 100% of students will increase their scores on Part I of the June Common Core RE in ELA by 5% as a 
result of 100% of ELA teachers using strategies to help students develop a positive growth mindset and productive 
persistence.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: One of the school’s strengths is that 100% of teachers agree or strongly agree that teachers in this school 
talk with one another about instruction. The vast majority of teachers are engaged in inquiry-based, structured 
professional collaborations that are aligned with the school’s instructional goals.(Data sources: 2017-2018 NYC DOE 
School Survey). Across the vast majority of classrooms, teaching strategies include multiple entry points as well as 
extensions to support learners. Student discussion and work products reflect critical thinking, participation, and 
ownership.  

Needs: Although teachers have made gains in meeting the needs of advanced learners, we need to continue to find 
opportunities to provide additional extensions for higher level learners. Informed by the Framework for Great 
Schools, there is a need to provide extensions into the curriculum for our students in the highest one-third and 
challenge our students to succeed at higher levels.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of students enrolled in ELA will earn scores on the June CC ELA regents that are in the CUNY college 
ready bracket above a score of 75 .

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We have been engaging our teachers in the practices of Danielson to increase effective practices in Domains 3b and 
3d of the Danielson Framework. 

Strengths: One of the school’s strengths is that 53.85% of teachers demonstrated effective practices in Domain 
3b:Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques and 3d: Using Assessment in Instruction. (Data source: 2017-2018 
NYC DOE Advance).  

Needs: Although teachers have made gains in Domains 3b and 3d, we need to continue to familiarize teachers with 
effective practices, instructional strategies, and structures that demonstrate effective and highly effective 
characteristics of 3b and 3d. We need to provide teachers with differentiated support, professional learning and 
modeling so they develop pedagogical practices aligned with the effective and highly effective categories on the 
Danielson Framework. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of the teachers will receive differentiated professional learning and purposeful feedback from 
frequent cycles of classroom observations from school leadership to improve their instruction aligned with the 
Danielson Framework. As a result, there will be a 5% increase in the overall passing rates for all Regents exams in June 
2019 as compared to June 2018.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: Our partner and CBO, New York City Mission Society, facilitates the Learning to Work Initiative, which is 
a job readiness and career exploration program designed to enhance the academic component of transfer high 
schools. As interns, students have the opportunity to “learn” to work as they gain experience at the job site 
without major risk. The opportunity provided allows students to develop skills and prepare for viable post-
secondary options in the work force. Students must remain in good academic standing in order to participate and 
earn the maximum number of hours per week. A significant piece to the LTW internship program utilizes the 
principles of Youth Development and the Primary Contact Model, which prescribes that students are known well by 
a minimum of one adult. This adult is generally the CBO’s advocate counselor, who is responsible for daily school 
support, attendance outreach, and communication with the parent/guardian. 

 

Needs: The average change in student attendance for the 2016-2017 SY was -2.99% (Data Source: 2016-2017 School 
Quality Snapshot). School-wide attendance data shows that the attendance rate for the 2017-2018 academic year 
was 63.7%. According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey Report, 64% of parents/guardians responded that, since 
the beginning of the school year, they have been asked or had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their 
school (for example, spent time helping in classrooms, helped with school-wide events, etc.) sometimes or often. 
(Data Source: 2017-2018 School Survey). This data indicates that a low response for parent involvelment in school 
activities can be indicative of a greater need to support low student attendance over all. We know that by digging 
deeper into the element of Strong Family-Community Ties, we can improve parent involvement at school activities 
including PTA meetings and conferences. Also, with 4 evening parent conferences (Fall & Spring), we have greater 
opportunities to host evenings for parents and families. By collaborating with parents, we can build stronger 
relationships with families as they engage with other parents and school staff. We also plan to host events during 
Tuesday’s parent engagement afternoons to promote stronger parent participation in order to provide support and 
resources to our school’s families. In turn, as we increase family involvement, we will improve student attendance. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of families will increase their involvement in school activities which will result in 100% of students 
increasing the average change in their individual student attendance by 5% as compared to 2017-2018.

are in 
temporary 
housing. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Our student life coordinator, guidance counselor, and parent coordinator (STH team) will Identify all STH families and 
act as liaisons for students living in temporary housing, and be responsible for tracking and providing interventions 
and support services in accordance with the McKinney Vento Act. The STH team will maintain a folder throughout the 
school year with ATS reports that include the names of students living in temporary housing situations and lists of 
services offered as funded by the Title I, Part A mandatory set aside. The STH team will participate in McKinney-Vento 
trainings on behalf of the school, each year. The STH team will work with the pupil accounting secretary to identify 
students in need of services and supports. The STH team will Inform school staff on how to respond to a student living 
in temporary housing and share resources from trainings. The STH team will support families/students in temporary 
housing by offering solutions and connecting them with resources. The STH team will monitor and improve the 
attendance of STH students; assist in recruiting STH parents for activities intended for them, and facilitate extended 
day activities for STH students. The STH team will perform visits to family shelters to ensure that basic necessities (e.g. 
school materials, transportation, etc.) and supplementary educational and counseling services are readily available to 
students and families. The STH team will coordinate after school programs for students in temporary housing & 
ensure that those who attend our school while living in another borough continue to receive integrated services. The 
STH team will identify specific areas where more services for students in temporary housing are being requested or 
where mandated responsibilities are not being met. The STH team will develop and enhance partnerships that 
provide additional services and resources to students and families.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
New teachers are recruited at city-wide hiring fairs. Current teachers at our school attend these hiring fairs and meet 
with potential candidates. Potential teachers are invited to our school to learn more about the position and the needs 
of our students. There are other instances where teachers may be recruited through collegial networking and on-line 
personnel services through the DOE. The DOE human resources liaison also reaches out to potential candidates and 
shares information. Our hiring committee will bring individuals into our school community who believe in our mission 
and vision and commitment to our students and families.  

 

From day one, our teachers are supported with extensive professional learning facilitated internally by peer 
collaborative teachers and a full-time instructional coach and externally by experts in our superintendency. Our 
current teachers are always able to provide a strong foundation of support to new staff. We will provide additional 
time throughout the week to support common planning time for all teachers. Teachers will receive differentiated 
professional development targeting their instructional challenges. Peer Collaborative Teachers and Coach will assist 
with facilitation of PD. We will focus on the cycles of learning (school wide inquiry) during whole school planning time 
after school on Mondays in which all staff analyze student work and revise instruction aligned to the CCLS.  
 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
All staff attends professional development workshops to meet their needs and support them in reaching their goals. 
Coaching visits take place with teachers individually and in small groups to support curriculum, lesson planning, and 
instruction. In addition, teachers meet weekly in a Professional Learning Community during an 80 minute block on 
Mondays and daily, by department, in Common Planning Time. The professional learning calendar outlines the details 
of our school’s professional learning plan over the course of the school year.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers are provided with professional development that increases their understanding of the appropriate uses of 
multiple assessment measures and how to use assessment results to improve instruction. Teachers attend these 
workshops at the school and facilitated by central. Teachers learn to create assessments that accurately measure 
student achievement regularly in the classroom. Some examples of assessment in the classroom include: observation 
(low inference notes), performance assessments, exit / entry tickets, or end of unit or weekly benchmarks. Teachers 
keep daily data grids to monitor learning and make adjustments when necessary. Teachers also determine areas of 
strength and weakness in students to guide instruction appropriately. In addition, providing students with 
actionable/meaningful feedback benefits the students’ next steps. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Metropolitan Diploma Plus High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Metropolitan Diploma Plus High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Snapshot, Quality 
Review Report, School Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 
 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Common Core performance based tasks in ELA four times a year to assess early literacy skills. In addition, we 
use our trimester benchmark assessments to gauge student understanding and next steps at the end of each trimester. 
These assessments are created by our teachers and designed to address specific skill targets in comprehension, analysis, 
critical thinking and argumentation. Teachers collect data from ATS to gather NYSESLAT scores. Thus far, the data suggests that 
ELLs' listening, speaking, reading and writing scores from the NYSESLAT results from the previous year are reflective of their 
diagnostic scores from the beginning of the school year. The data provides insights into the appropriate levels for instruction 
as well as strategies to implement with these students to improve in the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. 
Teachers collect quantitative data to drive instruction. This data is used by our ELL support team and content-area teachers to 
differentiate instruction for whole class instruction, small group instruction and one to one support. To further support our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

ELLs, our school will perform varied assessments periodically to track student progress and to further support early literacy 
skills. Our lesson planning framework is designed to create a multi-faceted workshop model which incorporates effective ELL 
strategies to meet the needs of those learners.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Our teachers align ELA curriculum to the Common Core State English Language Arts Standards that require students read and 
understand texts of increasing complexity. Our goal is to help prepare students to be college and career ready and our 
students engage in independent reading throughout the curriculum.  Our teachers create supports that include vocabulary 
development in the context of reading (e.g., explaining a word and providing a visual, asking students to use context clues to 
guess a word’s meaning, providing a student glossary with home language definitions and easy to understand English 
definitions); and multiple readings with additional questions to help students arrive at the meaning of a complex passage.  
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
As noted by our academic notable gains, our ELLs received academic success in our targeted intervention programs across all 
content areas. Teachers collaborate during common planning time to construct and revise instructional plans to provide ELL 
additional support for Common Core based tasks, Regents preparedness, and other targeted needs during the instructional 
day.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our teachers meet during common planning time in departments (daily) and whole staff (weekly) inquiry meetings to analyze 
student work and revise instructional practice. One example is collection of student work to measure students progress in 
Academic Language instruction. Teacher teams analyze student work using the following inquiry questions in their 
meetings: What is the importance of teaching academic language? How should I approach the teaching of academic language? 
Our goal in our cycles of inquiry is to continually collect student writing products, measure student performance and 
continually revise our instruction to improve student outcomes. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
NA 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The students at Metropolitan transfer from other NYC high schools and therefore we do not administer the NYSITELL to our 
incoming ELL students. We make every attempt to obtain the student's records from his/her original school. Our students 
receive notable academic gains when given multiple exposure to literacy classes and additional English Language Arts support 
for more than one trimester. Further, our ELLs have demonstrated academic achievement on Regents scores and credit 
accumulation as supported by their ELA ICT classroom setting.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We continually engage in cycles of inquiry across the content areas to revise instructional practice based on student work 
products. Teachers use weekly Focus Friday writing assignments and benchmark essays (every 3 weeks) to ensure students are 
making progress aligned with CCLS aligned writing rubrics. Teachers provide daily specific, actionable feedback in writing and 
orally. Students engage in weekly conferences with teachers to improve performance and receive progress reports every three 
weeks.

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Direct, explicit instruction is delivered using a flexible combination of push-in, pull-out model. Our school implements 
the Freestanding ENL program choice. The program models that our students follow are ungraded and heterogenous. 
Our students are focused on passing classes and preparing for upcoming exams to meet graduation requirements for 
a high school diploma. Our ELL support team surveys the ENL students to determine what content area they would 
like their teacher to push-in, in addition to meeting with their teacher during lunch or other scheduled meeting times. 
Our ELL support team meets with students at other times as per student need or request, assists students with 
content review and applicable assignments, and communicates daily with the student's advocate counselors and 
classroom teachers.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not Applicable   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not Applicable  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           For the current school year, we have two ELLs enrolled, one student is at the transitioning level and the second student 
is at the expanding levels of proficiency. According to NYS CR Part 154, high school students scoring at a transitional level are 
to receive 180 weekly minutes, and, high school students scoring at an expanding level are to receive 180 minutes per week. 
Our ELL students receive a minimum of 180 minutes in integrated ENL/ELA or other content areas in their classes 5 days per 
week for 54 minutes per day. Our school is faced with a scheduling challenge as we are limited with the time our ELL teacher 
spends in our school building; we create schedules that meet the mandated minutes. Unlike traditional high schools which 
have two academic terms each year, Metropolitan follows a trimester model to accelerate credit accumulation. Student 
programs alternate three times per school year.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All instruction at Metro is provided to our students in English. In our integrated ENL/ELA or other content area classes, 
teachers scaffold content by using visuals, interactive word walls, and activating prior knowledge. To activate student's prior 
knowledge the teacher uses visual aids by showing photos, charts, maps, or talking about students' experiences. We use a 
Balanced Literacy Approach, including shared readings and interactive writing to encourage language development. Lessons 
are organized and presented in the workshop model, and weekly student conferences are conducted with students to discuss 
progress. Our student population that we serve have academic skills that fall below grade-level as shown on intake 
assessments, student transcripts, common core performance assessments, and regents exams. Literacy support is provided by 
all teaching staff across all content areas. Students work on reading and writing skills in all core subject areas using a language-
based approach. All staff receive on-going professional development on differentiating instruction and assessment to meet the 
needs of all students, including ENLs. All teachers participate in a professional learning community which is held on a weekly 
basis from 2:40 to 4:00 pm, and professional learning during designated DOE professional development days, in conjuntion 
with our in-house academic coach.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

   ELLs are provided with glossaries and dictionaries for the content area subjects to support native language evaluations. In 
addition, exams are offered in the student's native language.       
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. The instructional plan for a SIFE student is to determine the nature and extent of the student's prior knowledge and 
experiences and to adjust interventions to reflect changing needs at regular intervals by meeting their social, emotional and 
cultural needs. All staff create a safe learning environment by introducing SIFE students to school structures, appropriate 
behaviors, important locations in the school, and routines. SIFE students will learn English along with the other ENL students 
in  pull-out or push-in settings with access to native language texts. Teachers offer academic intervention services for extra 
support.  
b. The instructional plan for ELLs who have been in the U.S. less than three years is to tap into the student's interests and 
strengths to scaffold new information and differentiate instruction to enrich literacy skills through culturally relevant resources 
and materials.  Newcomers interact with their peers who speak their native language as to lower anxious feelings. Topics are 
introduced slowly as to not intimidate the student, and slowly introduce more rigorous academic curriculum.  
c. The instructional plan for developing ELLs is to differentiate instruction to meet the diverse needs of ELL students. Various 
instructional approaches prepare ELLs for ELA testing in not only the NYSESLATs but also the NYSED CC ELA Regents 
examination. A continuation of instruction of explicit vocabulary is necessary to build academic literacy skills. The proficiency 
levels for English, as established by the NYSED, present the stages of growth for the four language arts areas: listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing.  
d. The instructional plan for long-term ELLs is to continue the social and emotional support in the language acquisition process. 
Long term ELLs also receive support through scaffolding and differentiation of tasks and class activities.  
e. The instructional plan for former ELLs is to provide Academic Intervention Services (AIS) to monitor student progress. ELL 
instruction or regular consultation between the ELL support team and mainstream teachers is also included. 
Testing accommodations for ELLs are as follows: separate location, extended time, access to bilingual dictionaries and/or 
glossaries, and access to translated exams in their native language.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We provide those students with grade-level materials and instructional strategies to access academic content areas and 
accelerate English language development. This would include, but not limited to: flexible groupings, extensive vocabulary 
building, and use of visuals and graphic organizers across all content areas.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We program ELL-SWDs into integrated co-teaching classes for specific content areas as well as environments that provide for 
extra support to meet the students diverse needs and provide them with the necessary support to enable them to function 
with their peers in the least restrictive environment.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas include before and after-school school 
academic intervention services and Regents preparedness offered in our Saturday Academy. All content area teachers use 
reading and writing strategies to address achievement gaps. We have four certified Special Education teachers on staff who 
have worked with ELLs previously. Additional related service providers are available through referral from our CBO partner, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

NYC Mission Society. Students receive additional support for CCLS, Regents prep and other exam preparation during the 
instructional day. We presently do not use native language during instruction.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, we are not planning any changes in our program for ELLs because we have a small population of 
ELL learners. If the demographics of our school change, and more ELL students enroll, we will make changes to meet the needs 
of those students. If necessary, we would consider expanding our ELL services by hiring a full-time ESL specialist and creating a 
self-contained ESL class.  We will have a certified  ESL teacher who will provide services to even one ELL student. We will 
outreach to a neighboring school or a school in our campus to share effective practices for our ELL students.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No ELL services will be discontinued.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs and services. Students are invited to all school programs, 
invitations and postings are presented to each student. All school support structures are available to our ELLs: media center, 
school library, before and after-school tutoring, Saturday school program, and extracurricular activities (basketball and 
cheerleading). In our building we have a CBO that offers students an opportunity to participate in an external internship 
experience. Our school goal is to enrich each student's educational and social experience at Metropolitian by providing them 
with opportunities to participate in meaningful activities that increase student engagement in school, which ultimately leads to 
improved student outcomes and higher levels of success in high school and beyond.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All classrooms are equipped with a SMART board and two desktop computers, document cameras and classroom laptops are 
available upon request. Each of the classrooms holds a collection of English dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries, bilingual 
content area glossaries, visuals and manipulatives.  In addition , we encourage use of technology in the classroom; teachers 
incorporate SMART boards, laptops, online resources and internet based projects into their classroom activities. Classrooms 
have interactive word walls to assist students with high-frequency and content area vocabulary, and visual aids to support 
learning of new topics, ideas and concepts.       
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Currently, we do not offer a TBE and/or Dual Language program at our school, as our student population does not require 
these services. We currently offer integrated ENL services, however, home language translation is not used during classroom 
instructional time, but mostly for communicating with families and school events. Our school embraces our students' home 
languages and cultures of our student population. We have teachers and advocate counselors who speak languages other than 
English (Spanish, Haitian-Creole, French) and can translate if needed.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Age and grade appropriate texts are used with our ELL population. As a transfer high school, our population of students are 
over-aged and under-credited. Many of our students exhibit skills that are below grade level, especially in the areas of reading, 
writing and mathematics. With teacher guidance, our ELL population of students choose topics and classroom activities that 
are appropriate for their age and grade level. Teachers provide ELL students with direct, explicit instruction and choose 
appropriate texts according to student's grade level.  Teachers implement services and resources that correspond to ELL 
students age and grade level.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All classrooms are equipped with a SMART board and two desktop computers, document cameras and classroom laptops are 
available upon request. Each of the classrooms holds a collection of English dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries, bilingual 
content area glossaries, visuals and manipulatives.  In addition to, we encourage use of technology in the classroom, teachers 
incorporate SMART boards, laptops, online resources and internet based projects into their classroom activities. Classrooms 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

have interactive word walls to assist students with high-frequency and content area vocabulary, and visual aids to support 
learning of new topics, ideas and concepts.       
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At this time, we have not admitted any newly enrolled ELL students and therefore we do not offer programs to newly enrolled 
ELLs before the start of the school year. If the demographics of our school shift in the future, we will consider offering activities 
which support that population of students. The activities we have planned for new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year 
are various workshops and services for parents offered by our CBO partner, Mission Society. ELL students participate in 
workshops offered throughout the school year to learn various topics and gain a deeper understanding of academic 
expectations and coursework.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

ELLs are offered the same language electives as any other student at our school, which include Spanish as a foreign language.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Currently, we do not offer a dual language program.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school includes trainings offered by city-wide opportunities. 
School leaders, guidance counselors, teachers, parent coordinator, and secretary attend various workshops and professional 
development meetings throughout the year to learn the latest ELL instructional techniques, methods and instructional 
strategies. Teachers attend a summer institute professional development workshop to learn the latest in ELL pedagogy 
(differentiation techniques and strategies for working with ELL students). Our ELL support team (school leaders, guidance 
counselors, teachers, secretary, and parent coordinator) attend monthly professional development offered by the FSC. The 
school implementation team meets monthly to share what they have learned at those meetings and turn-keys their newly 
acquired strategies, methods, and techniques to pedagogical staff.  During common planning time, our ELL support team 
consults with classroom content area teachers to offer ideas, resources, and study research that support language 
development for our ELL population.  
The professional development that is offered to teachers in supporting ELLs as they engage in the CCLS are teachers 
participating in TSCCI, transfer school common core institute, which includes one-to-one direct coaching, monthly workshops, 
and Saturday professional development seminars throughout the school year. The specific activities offered are to develop 
rigorous instruction and assessments aligned to CCLS. Through the workshops teachers design and norm rubrics, create 
assessments, develop instructional strategies and tools for giving feedback to students, and create a tool to track student's 
progress in skills and academic behavior of persistence. The school's literacy coach will differentiate support based on teacher 
need.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
MDPHS is a high school setting. To assist staff so that they can help ELLs who are transitioning to post-secondary placements, 
the ELL support team and teachers meet to discuss which students will be graduating.  
The minimum ELL training for all staff will be met through our weekly one hour professional learning community meetings and 
during designated DOE professional development days in conjunction with our literacy support coach and external 
instructional specialists. Our literacy support coach uses common planning time and DOE designated professional 
development days to turn-key literacy strategies and varied methods of instruction with individual teachers through 
curriculum, unit and lesson planning. All school staff, including pedagogues, administrators, secretary, counselors and parent 
coordinator, are offered multiple opportunities to participate in professional development through the NYCDOE which focuses 
on meeting the needs of our ELL students and families. Our school maintains a record of professional development completed 
by each program, the number of hours completed and the teachers and support staff who are required to complete the 
requirement.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
One on one parent meetings during scheduled sessions from 2:40 to 4:00 pm on Tuesday family engagement Professional 
Development.  

 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parent involvement is apparent in our school community. Our school has examined its need for translation of important verbal 
and written information. Our staff makes sure that important materials are translated and support staff are available to 
interpret to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in their native language. If additional 
language support services are required, the Language Translation Unit services are available. Upon intake, parents of 
prospective students complete a written survey about their child and attend an in-person interview with an appropriate 
translator to facilitate the conference. In addition, parents meet with their child's Advocate Counselor as their counselor 
remains in constant communication with families throughout the year. Parents are invited to participate in monthly PTA 
meetings, and are informed in writing when important meetings and parent workshops are scheduled. Parent workshops are 
offered based on feedback from parent surveys. In the completed surveys, parents express their child's interests and needs to 
help their child to succeed in the transfer school setting and to assist the school with transition planning options (college, trade 
school, military). In addition, our school offers an extensive internship program for students; parents/guardians are part of the 
internship contract process. At this point in time, written notices and communications to parents are available in English, 
French and Spanish. Translation requests are completed within two days of the request.     
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
There are two reasons why students attend transfer high schools: the lack of success at their previous high school(s), and their 
desire to earn a high school diploma. Transfer high schools demand dedication and flexibility on behalf of their staff to help meet 
the needs of diverse learners and to help students move forward in their personal lives. Our staff is committed to working out 
student's personal and academic needs.  Our ELLs are aware of their literacy deficits, and teachers support these students using 
various strategies and flexible groupings. One unique feature of transfer high schools is the partnership with one or more 
community-based organizations. Our community-based organization provides the school with trained Advocate Counselors who 
meet with students at least two times per week for both individual and/or group counseling to help assess and monitor individual

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Meri Yallowitz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When students register in our school, our intake team (administrator,student life coordinator, teacher, secretary, 
parent coordinator, ESL specialist, IEP specialist, and advocate counselor) reviews student information in paper 
and electronic form (student records; ATS reports) and conducts an informal interview with each family. We 
follow the parents' request for language in which to receive school communications. If they have not filled out the 
HLIS, we give it to them during the interview. We have staff members who speak Spanish, French, and Haitian 
Creole who are available to help translate as needed. We also utilize the NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation 
Unit in order to translate over the phone, at meetings and documents as needed.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We have staff members that translate into Spanish or Haitian Creole, and we will identify staff within our campus to

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All staff will review Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 on September 5, 2017. Translation and Interpretation Unit will 
provide training to parent coordinators and other key school-based staff on language access requirements.When our 
school or the Translation and Interpretation Unit is temporarily unable to provide required translation into one or 
more covered languages, we will provide, in addition to any other assistance, a cover letter or notice on the face of 
the English document in the appropriate covered language(s), indicating how a parent can request free translation or 
interpretation of such document. The Translation and Interpretation Unit will provide periodic training to our parent 
coordinator and other key personnel on the language access requirements contained in this regulation and on 
resources available to support these requirements. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At parent conferences, PTA meetings, and one-to-one conferences, the check list of notification requirments will be 
available to parents. The electronic banner displays notices regarding language assistance services at the security 
desk. We use Skedula to provide notices of language assistance services for parent access.
