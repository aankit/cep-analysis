Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 169 Vision Statement:  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At Sunset Park School, our core values - Friendship, Integrity, Responsibility, and Excellence (FIRE) - drive our vision. 
We are a welcoming, inclusive community where we celebrate the diversity among our students, staff, and 
community members. We foster a love of learning by providing an enriching, well-rounded education. We open 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

students' eyes to the world around them, encourage them to make positive change in their community, and support 
them as they realize their full potential. Together, we work for a better tomorrow. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Public School 169 is a large, Title 1 elementary school in Sunset Park that serves approximately 1,400 students in 
grades K-5. The school building is designed to service 1,146 students, currently at capacity. In the 2016-7 school year, 
Asian students comprised 57% of the student body and Hispanic students comprised 38% of the student body.  

Our programming includes visual art, music, drama, science, technology and physical education. We have: 

● 2 visual art, 2 music, and 2 drama teachers 

● 4 physical education teachers 

● 2 science teachers and a science classroom with a connecting garden  

● 2 technology teachers and a computer laboratory. 

Sunset Park School is in good standing. It was removed from the Priority and Focus list in 2016.  

In 2017-18, more than 650 students took part in elective afterschool programs, which included musical instruments, 
art, animation, drama, dance, cooking and academic programs. The school participated in Cool Culture (enabling free 
access to Kindergarteners to NYC cultural institutions), and Cookshop for parents and children (1 class per grade). We 
also partnered with Sunset Spark to bring robotics to our 4th grade and will continue those partnerships and 
programs in 2018-19.  

In 2018-9 Sunset Park School will continue to grow our dual language programs in Chinese and Spanish, continue our 
work to improve instruction in all our classrooms, and we plan to continue improving our communications with our 
diverse and predominantly non-English speaking parent community. In 2018-19, an important goal is for all our 
mandated students to receive ENL, RTI and AIS services. Six out-of-classroom teaching positions were created for 
2017-8 to enable us to meet those mandates, thus building an AIS team. We will continue to build on that work in the 
2018-19 school year.  

In 2018-19, we will continue our partnership with NDI, National Dance Institute for our 4th graders. literacy and dual 
language consultants, The Math Collective, and Goldmansour to support ICT partnerships,.  

The principal is beginning her 5th year at the school. The 4 Assistant Principals are going into their 4th year at the 
school.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 15% of students have Individualized Educational Plans. English Language Learners comprise 48% of the 
student population, and approximately 76% of students speak a language other than English at home. To 
accommodate our school community, all notices are sent home in English, Spanish, and Chinese, and all meetings are 
translated. This means our students require more visual supports to ensure access to curriculum, bilingual settings 
where appropriate, social emotional supports to ease their transition to another country and language, and parental 
engagement in a variety of languages.  

For the 2018-19 school year, there will be 52 classes, including: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

  8 Dual language Chinese and Dual language Spanish (Kindergarten, first and second grade) 
  9 Chinese bilingual 
  1 Spanish bilingual 
  9 self-contained ENL (English as a New Language) 
  15 integrated co-teaching (two of which are transitional bilingual) 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In 2017-18, Sunset Park School, PS 169 invested significant resources in building teacher's capacity, both through 
building an AIS and RTI team and investing significantly in building teacher's content knowledge of math and 
literacy across K-5 through staff developers and on site coaches. This aligns directly with Rigorous Instruction.  
 
For the 2018-19 school year, we are continuing this emphasis on Rigorous Instruction by emphasizing reading 
comprehension as a school-wide focus.  
We'll do this in the following ways:  
 

Literacy staff developer to focus on reading comprehension and develop the reading block 

Special Education, to support Collaborative Team teachers in co-planning and co-teaching lessons 

  Professional Development (PD) from outside experts and consultants in the following subject areas: 
 
  Math focus on word problems 
 
  Dual Language, to create Mandarin/English and Spanish/English curricula for second grade 
  Reading Rescue training for RTI providers and selected para-professionals 
 
  Time for teachers to plan and collaborate on their instruction 

Small group instruction providing AIS services in math and literacy

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strength: In our most recent Quality Review (2016-17), our area of strength was 3.4, high expectations. In addition, 
according to the 2016-17 NYC School Quality Guide, we have made improvements every year under Rigorous 
Instruction in the multi year summary of survey element scores, climbing from 1.60 in 2015 to 2.66 in 2017. To 
continue this growth in High Expectations, we will continue to focus on providing access for diverse learners including 
English language learners and students with disabilities during the 2018-19 school year. We will provide additional 
supports, including:  

  Enrichment clubs on Wednesdays and Thursdays 
  Title III for English language learners on Saturdays 
  AIS math and literacy will take place during the instructional day 
  RTI will take place during the instructional day 
  ENL will take place during the instructional day 
 
 

Supporting English Language Learners through the Arts (visual arts, music, drama) during the school day 
Improving our science curriculum K-5 to provide more hands on learning such as, gardening, live animals, and 
various scientific investigations 

  Expanding dual language in Kindergarten and first grade for the Spanish and Chinese program. The program 
will expand to grade 2; In Kindergarten and First Grade, there will be a side by side model in the Chinese DL 
program. 

  We will departmentalize in grade five which will allow teachers to instruct students in their area of expertise. 
  Piloting Eureka math with triads of teachers on grades 1 and 3 and as part of 5th grade departmentalization 
 
  Collaborative Action Research Project (CARP) will allow teachers to actively participate in Action Research 

Learning Partners with Spanish Bilingual Classes 

with schools across the city 

 

Needs: 

Based on our ELA data from 2016-17, 29% of our students in grades 3-5 scored a level 3 or 4 on the ELA state exam. In 
response, we are focusing schoolwide on reading comprehension across all subject areas in 2018-19. We’ll focus on 
this in the following ways: 

  Math and Literacy Vertical Teams that meet during Monday PDs with a focus on our instructional focus of 

Reading Comprehension 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

  Math, Literacy and Social Emotional Staff Developers; the three pillars of our work (math, literacy and social 

emotional development) all impact student achievement. As such, we are continuing our work with the math 
collaborative, the literacy collaborative and ERP (Emotionally Responsive Practice).  

  Dual Language and Goldmansour (Special Education) Consultant  
  AIS support in grades K-5. We increased our AIS team by five positions positions in the 2017-18 school year. 

We will continue this work with the AIS team in 2018-19 to work with teachers and Assistant Principals to 
assess students to monitor progress, as well as analyze relevant data to target students for AIS and RTI 
support 

  Parent workshops with a focus on reading comprehension 
  Universal Literacy Coach will be working with grades K-2 providing support to teachers and students through 

the citywide U-Lit program.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

At risk students' progress is being monitored through formative 
assessments by classroom teachers and out of classroom 
teachers that push-in to classes. These assessments should be 
used as data to identify new at risk students and instruction 
should be adjusted to meet the needs of students. Targeted 
instruction is provided to students when AIS providers push-in to 
classrooms. Intervention time is provided for all classrooms by 
the classroom teachers and out of classroom teachers, when out 
of classroom teachers push-in to classes. During this time, 
student to teacher ratio is reduced and targeted differentiated 
instruction for identified students can be delivered. 

 

STEAM focused Enrichment will be provided to students 
grades K-5 on Wednesday and Thursday. Teachers will 
be paid per session for this activity.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In our most recent Quality Review (2016-2017), we received a rating of "Well Developed" in both 1.4 and 3.4, which 
are both indicators of school culture. 

This is an excerpt from our 2016-17 Quality Review: "School wide Professional Development in Responsive Classroom 
has been provided to meet another school expectation in support for students’ social-emotional learning. Teachers 
and educational assistants attended either a Saturday or a summer session for an introductory overview. Several 
teachers attended a four-day summer training session, and committed to facilitate ongoing professional development 
for colleagues throughout the school year. Teachers utilize the professional resource, The Morning Meeting Book, 
collectively and independently. As a result, schoolwide Morning Meeting has been incorporated daily so that students 
build community, develop social skills, practice and apply academics, and enjoy learning. Educational assistants and 
school aides have also received training to apply Responsive Classroom techniques to their interactions with 
students." 

In 2017-2018, we continued this work and built upon it by continuing our focus on Responsive Classroom, developing 
a series of lesson plans addressing the Responsive Classroom approach to conflict resolution and piloting them in 
classrooms at all grade levels; and implementing Bank Street’s Emotionally Responsive Practice (ERP) in kindergarten 
by providing teachers with training, supplies, and on-site coaching support provided by Bank Street. 

Needs 

Our students contend with stressors: many are new immigrants faced with adjusting to new family configurations and 
starting school in a new language and culture; many have experienced or regularly experience separations from 
caretakers; over 70% of our students receive free or reduced lunch; approximately 10% reside in temporary housing. 

We need to continue to build on the work that we began in 2016. We need to continue to put systems in place to 
form strong relationships with adults and peers, and provide the supports and teach the skills they need to have 
positive interactions. We continue to find that the majority of discipline infractions occur during lunch periods, and 
we have identified a group of students who often have conflicts during lunch. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

  Continuing Care Team (Pupil Personnel Team) meets 
regularly to plan and adjust interventions for at-risk 
students and students with IEPS 

 

School Spirit Committee, which encompasses student 
representatives from 5th grade, meets regularly with a 
pedagogue and administrator to plan grade and school 
wide spirit days.  

  Responsive Classroom Morning Meeting, a "Respect for 

All" initiative, will continue in every classroom, K-5 

  Continued PD in implementing Responsive Classroom 
practices in classrooms throughout the school building 
(eg. during lunch, recess, before the start of the school 
day, etc)  

  Book of the Month will build from the previous two 

years to develop Core Values (FIRE) 

  Purchase books with social-emotional and conflict 

resolution theme to create a “bibliotherapy resource 
library.” 

  Cafeteria Committee, which includes parents, teachers, 

school aides and administrators, meets biweekly to 
discuss clean up in the cafeteria, rules in the cafeteria, 
recess logistics, purchasing of games in the cafeteria.  

  Emotionally Responsive Practice (ERP) was launched in 

the 2017-18 school year. All Kindergarten teachers, 
guidance counselors, and Kindergarten support staff 
were trained in ERP, specifically in using the Bears 
Curriculum. This included workshops, as well as on-site 
coaching support. We'll continue this work in ERP by 
being part of an ERP collaborative, in which we partner 
with other schools using a similar approach.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

  This is our fourth year of an embedded Professional Learning Period into the school day, for teachers to 

conduct action research with their grade team and modify the curriculum as needed. Out-of-classroom staff 
participate in meetings with classroom teachers, and also conduct their own action research. As a result, on 
the 2017-18 NYC School Survey, 92% of teachers responded that they talk with one another about instruction, 
and 94% of teachers responded that they modify instructional activities and materials to meet the 
developmental needs of their students. 

  Currently, each grade has two cohort leaders, one for literacy and one for math. Each cohort leader 
participates in a monthly cohort leader meeting, with a vertical literacy or math team, facilitated by 
instructional coaches. This collaboration is reflected in the school's most recent Quality Review (2016-17), in 
which the school received a "Well Developed" rating for Indicator 4.1 (Teacher Support and Supervision), and 
a"Proficient" rating for Indicator 4.2 (Teacher Teams and Leadership Development), with the report noting, 
"Professional collaborations promote the achievement of school goals and the implementation of the 
Common Core Learning Standards, strengthening the instructional practices of teachers." 

  There are a variety of committees at Sunset Park School, PS 169, including but not limited to: Community 

Outreach Diversity Committee, Resource Committee, Hiring Committee, Testing team, Dual Language 
Committee and Gardening Committee. These committees include teachers, administrators, coaches, 
coordinators, school aides, parents, SLT members, etc. As noted in the 2016-17 Quality Review, "Teachers 
build leadership capacity and have a voice in key decisions that affect student learning across the school." 

 

Needs:  

  We received a score of Proficient in 4.2 of the 2016-17 School Quality Review. In order to move towards a 
score of Well Developed, we are focusing on alignment across teacher teams. The structure of Professional 
Learning Periods and vertical teams is in place, and now our work in 2018-19 is to deepen the impact of those 
structures by building teams' pedagogy "to systematically analyze key elements of teacher work, including 
classroom practice, assessment data and student work." 
In the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 71% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their school, teachers 
design instructional programs (e.g. lesson, units) (Q8a). Similarly, 61% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed 
that at their their school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinator their teaching with instruction at 
other levels (Q8b). In order to improve on these scores, we have put systems in place to increase 
opportunities for teacher collaboration in the school, both in grade levels, in vertical teams and through 
committees.

  Under the current meeting structure, teachers in each grade are split into two cohorts for weekly meetings. 

Many teachers have reported that this structure limits collaboration across the grade. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will engage in structured collaborations with a focus on improving students’ 
mathematical proficiency and comprehension of word problems, resulting in a 2% increase in students achieving level 3 
or 4, as evidenced by the 2019 NYS math exam.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength 

  We have a multilingual, collaborative parent support team that works to ensure a unified message. 
  Our school website, complete with information about curriculum, school-wide events, and our school 

community, is translated into 3 languages for parent access. 

  We provide interpretation at all of our school functions, including family meetings, PTA meetings, Parent 

Teacher conferences, workshops, and more. 

  We have simultaneous interpretation equipment, which is used by our staff as well as professional 

interpreters. 

  This year, Title I funds paid for free special events for families -- Lunar New Year and Cinco de Mayo -- for 

School Messenger texting capabilities and for special family workshops. 

  Our most recent Quality Review highlighted 3.4 as an area of celebration, which includes high expectations 

for families. 

  All of the information sent home to families is in 3 languages, such as the parent newsletter, the school 

calendar, testing memo, fliers for parent workshops, ballots for elections, etc. 

 

Need 

  On our NYC School Survey for the 2016-2017 school year, 86% of parents reported that they are somewhat or 

very likely to attend a general school meeting or school event. This is in comparison to 93% of parents in our 
district and 91% of parents across the city. Our need is to increase parent involvement in school events.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the school will have a 4% increase of parents reporting that they are somewhat or very likely to attend a 
general school meeting or school event, as measured by the 2018-19 School Quality Guide/Strong Family Community 
Ties and as compared to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide/Strong Family Community Ties.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Sunset Park School, P.S. 169 is a pleasant environment to teach in where we work to address the needs of all learners. 
Every effort is made to: 

a. Interview potential staff through the Sunset Park School Hiring Committee wherein we prioritize teacher's 
knowledge/experience with English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities 

b. Determine potential for competency and compatibility as a pedagogue at this school 

Our school has a high percentage of ELL’s. Approximately 45% of the students are designated with ELL status. That 
said, every attempt to recruit Chinese Bilingual, Spanish Bilingual and ENL teachers is made in order to appropriately 
service our student population to meet their targeted needs. We encourage our present teachers to get an extension 
to their licenses, in these high needs areas. We encourage teachers to use the subsidized bilingual programs available 
through the Department of Education. Our school has also seen an increase in students that require an ICT placement, 
therefore every effort has been made to hire teachers who are licensed in Special Education, so that the needs of 
these students can be met by an expert teacher. 

 

We use the Open Market Hiring System, New Teacher Finder, and Indeed to post open positions and find highly 
qualified candidates.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We will continue our work in 2018-19 with staff developers across all content areas. Goldmansour provides targeted 
support to our special education teachers, Dorothy Barnhouse provides literacy support, the Math Collective supports

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers review class assessments, informal and formal, in order to identify gaps and noticeable trends within their 
own class. Teachers then meet on a grade level to discuss the analysis of individual class data in order to identify 
commonalities during the Professional Learning Period and grade meetings. These meetings also include teachers 
pooling resources and ideas on how best to meet student needs. The interim assessment data is also used to align 
professional development for teachers so that they may target individual student needs.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

<!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->Rationale: 
<!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E--> 
Our instructional supplemental program will be designed to develop and build language 
proficiency in listening, speaking, reading and writing through content areas, literacy and the 
arts. Our approach is to support students' language development through the integration of arts 
modalities into the academic curriculum. This will take place though programs offered for 
English language learners after school and on Saturdays. 
The instructional approach of our Saturday program will be thematic based on student interests 
and grade appropriate social studies & science topics. Instruction will be centered on literature, 
writing, and student experiences. Teachers will create lessons utilizing fiction and nonfiction 
literature while incorporating opportunities for real life experiences, i.e. community walks, plays, 
field trips, etc. Students will engage in close reading of text and write a variety of expository 
pieces. Students will also engage in projects integrating what they have learned through their 
reading and experiential trips, which they will present to each other. Instruction will include 
multiple opportunities to read, write, and speak with each other, thereby increasing language 
skills and fluency. 
Within the Saturday program, we will also have two newcomer sections, which will maintain the 
thematic focus of the program, but with a larger focus on foundational skills, as well as on 
introducing the school community. 
Our after-school program will also incorporate this interdisciplinary approach, giving us the 
opportunity to teach reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills to ELLs through enrichment 
clubs that focus on areas such as drama, dance, music, visual arts, robotics, and media. 
 
Subgroups/grade levels: 
The Saturday program will target students in grades 2-5. In determining subgroups to invite, we 
will analyze data from the EDAT and the RLAT. Our plan is to invite students whose 
performance on the NYSESLAT has either stayed the same or regressed, as well as students 
identified by EDAT to be at a risk level greater than 5, though if we see different need based on 
analysis of 2018 NYSESLAT data, we may alter this plan to address the need. Newcomers will 
also be invited to the Saturday program, with priority given to students who have been in the 
country less than one year. With a maximum of 20 sections, the Saturday program will serve up 
to 265 students for each cycle, with a student-teacher ratio of no more than 15:1. Students in both 
the newcomer and the general program will be grouped with other students on the same grade. If 
necessary, there will be bridge classes in bands of no more than two grades (2/3, 4/5). 
The after-school program will be open to students in grades K-5, and priority will be given to 
Expanding ELLs and former ELLs who scored Commanding on the NYSESLAT within the last 
two years. Groups will be in grade bands (K/1, 2/3, 4/5). There will be up to 50 sections of after-
school clubs, with the sections split between two days each week, serving up to 650 students 
throughout the year.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
We will begin our after-school/Saturday program in October to run through May.  After school 
will run every Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30pm-4:30pm. Students will be programmed for 
either Wednesday or Thursday, for a total of 27 sessions. Our Saturday program will be from 
9am -12pm. The program for newcomers will run in 2 cycles of 10 sessions each (November-
January, March-May). The general ENL program will run for 21 sessions.   
All records pertaining to both programs, including attendance and family communication, will be 
kept on file with the school's ELL coordinator, Yesenia Caccamo, as well as digitally within the 
school's Google Drive. 
 
Language of instruction: 
The language of instruction for both programs will be English with some home language support 
pending language needs & staffing. We will provide home language support through staffing 
when available (teachers who are bilingual in English/Spanish and English/Chinese) and 
supplemental materials such as books, songs, poems, videos, and other teacher-created 
instructional materials in the students' home languages, 
 
Number and types of certified teachers: 
The program will require a maximum of 20 teachers. Our goal is to have at least 15 of these 
teachers be certified in TESOL or have a bilingual extension. Teachers who do not have a 
TESOL/bilingual certification will have, at minimum, certification in early childhood or 1-6 
general education. These teachers will all be paired with a teacher who does hold a 
TESOL/bilingual certification and they will team-teach using established ICT models. 
 
Materials: 
- Technology-laptops/iPads, iReady assessments 
- Variety of literature, texts, guided reading sets, big books, poetry, etc., in English as well as in 
students' home languages (publishers include Scholastic, Follett, American Reading Company, 
China Sprout); we will also use Fountas and Pinnell Running Record Assessments and Leveled 
Literacy Intervention kits. 
- Trips to historical landmarks, museums, plays, shows, etc. 
- Technology materials and F&P materials (assessments and LLI kits) will be at no cost to Title 
III funds; all other materials (literature, field trips), will be purchased with Title III funds.

Rationale: 
We will provide ongoing, high quality professional development for all ENL and bilingual 
certified teachers that specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. We have 
created a professional development committee to help make informed decisions to develop, plan, 
and deliver high quality professional development to help strengthen teachers' best practices and 
increase students achievement throughout the year. Professional development will help teachers

Part C: Professional Development  
provide scaffolds and adjust curriculum and instruction to address language needs and promote 
reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. 
As we have ENL, transitional bilingual, and dual language programs at our school, professional 
development will be targeted to meet the needs of the teachers within each specific program 
through monthly vertical team meetings. We we also be provided additional targeted 
professional development to teachers of Dual Language classes, as our program, which we began 
two years ago in kindergarten, is growing each year. In addition, three classes will be receiving 
professional development through the Department of Education's Learning Partners program, 
with a focus on improving literacy for Spanish-speaking English language learners in grades K, 
and 2. 
 
Teachers to receive training: 
All teachers in the school will receive ELL-focused professional development throughout the 
school year during Monday PD time. 
Certified ENL and bilingual teachers across grades k-5 will receive training during Monday PD 
time. Teachers will be grouped according to which model they are implementing in their 
classroom (ENL, transitional bilingual, dual language) and meet in vertical teams across grades. 
Teachers participating in the Title III Saturday program will participate in a professional 
development and curriculum development session before each cycle (two per year, if they are 
teaching the full program). 
Three teachers - a kindergarten Spanish Dual Language teacher, a 2nd grade Spanish Dual 
Language teacher, and a 3rd grade ENL ICT teacher, will participate in the learning partners 
program. 
Dual language teachers in grades K-2 will participate in professional development with a dual 
language consultant. 
 
Schedule and Duration: 
ELL-focused professional development for all staff will take place on at least 7 Mondays during 
the school year, beginning in September as determined by the staff development committee. 
In addition to these 7 sessions, vertical team professional development sessions, during which 
ENL and bilingual teachers will receive more targeted professional development in their 
respective areas, will take place one Monday per month (10 times per year) beginning in 
September. 
Teachers participating in the Title III Saturday program will have one 3-hour PD and curriculum 
development session on a Saturday in October, and one session on a Saturday in February, 
during which assistant principals Emily Hurst and Joanna Cohen, along with the school's ENL 
coordinator, Yesenia Caccamo, will work with them on developing lessons incorporating best 
practices for ELLs. 
A dual language consultant  will be scheduled for 5 days each over the course of the year 
beginning in September. Teachers will be programmed during the school day to meet with 
consultants for periods of 2-4 hours, depending on focus and need. 
Records of all professional development, including participating teachers, agendas and sign-in 
sheets, information on consultants, and budget implications, are kept in the school's Google 
Drive. 
 
Topics to be covered: 
Best practices in: 
- Integrating language and content instruction for ELLs 
- Language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction 
- Assessing and meeting the linguistic needs of ELLs 
- Vocabulary development and support using ENL strategies 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

Part C: Professional Development  
- Teaching and learning though the arts 
- Supporting ELLs in reading complex texts 
- Co-teaching strategies to support integrated ENL instruction 
- Co-teaching in a TBE ICT class 
- Supporting ELLs in math 
- Preparing for the NYSESLAT 
- Differences between the three ELL programs - ENL, TBE, DL 
These PD sessions will positively impact the progress of ELLs because they will help teachers 
design lessons that address the learning needs of ELLs, implement targeted interventions, and 
assess the ongoing progress of students in their class. 
 
Providers: 
Monday professional development will be facilitated by coaches, assistant principals, the ELL 
coordinator, Yesenia Caccamo, the dual language coordinator, Raysa Villanova, and, where 
appropriate, ENL and bilingual teachers who have received professional development in vertical 
teams and turn-key to other staff members. Monday professional development is at no cost to the 
program. 
The curriculum development for Saturday Academy teachers will be facilitated by assistant 
principals Emily Hurst and Joanna Cohen, along with the ELL coordinate, Yesenia Caccamo. Up 
to 20 teachers will be paid, in part through Title III funds, for this this 3-hour session, and will be 
paid during the pay period immediately following the session. 
One dual language consultant, Marie Bouteillon, will work with dual language teachers, and will 
be paid in part through Title III funds. Teachers will not be paid for these sessions.

Rationale: 
Families are vital partners in our students’ education and achievement. In order to help foster 
family involvement, we strive to create and provide meaningful, engaging workshops, programs 
and activities specifically for our families of ELLs throughout the year. 
 
Schedule and duration: 
We will provide monthly workshops for families covering a variety of topics based on families’ 
needs and interests, interests such as: health, how to support their child's education, parenting, 
community services available, outreach programs, stress management, immigration, state 
assessments-NYSESLAT, ELA/math, common core learning standards, curriculum, etc. 
Duration will vary based on topic, presenters and attendance. School staff provides interpretation 
into Spanish and Chinese at all workshops, and translates all written materials.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
In addition to regular workshops, we will offer Saturday adult ESL classes; these classes meet on 
Saturdays from 9:00am to 12:00pm, and will run November through May for a total of 21 
sessions. 
We evaluate the needs of our parents by promoting an open door policy. Our parents are 
encouraged to speak to our two parent coordinators and/or our family workers for any assistance 
or concerns. To meet the needs of our community, we have a full time Chinese speaking parent 
coordinator as well as a full time Spanish speaking parent coordinator available to provide 
ongoing parental support. Members of our office staff are also proficient in either Chinese or 
Spanish. To communicate with our parents that speak a language other than Spanish or Chinese, 
we contact the Translation Unit for assistance as needed. 
 
Providers: 
Family workshops will facilitated by Assistant principals, coaches, ENL providers, teachers, 
parent coordinators, family workers, community members, etc. We will also be working with 
Department of Education's interpretation unit to provide training for our staff and ongoing 
support. Adult ESL will be taught by licensed teachers who may have a TESOL certification. 
 
Notification: 
Families are informed of all events and workshops through a monthly family newsletter, the 
family calendar, the school website, flyers and brochures, and PTA meetings. All families of 
ELL students will be invited to participate in the programs, workshops, and adult ESL classes. 
All written communication to families is translated and sent home in English, Spanish, and 
Chinese. 
All agendas, attendance sheets, invitations in families' preferred languages will be maintained 
and kept on file by our ENL coordinator, Yesenia Caccamo, and our school business manager, 
Johanna Bjorken.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Some assessment tools we use to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs are the i-Ready Adaptive Diagnostic, Fundations 
assessments, Fountas and Pinnell, Expeditionary Learning and teacher-created units. Teachers also utilize data collected from 
ongoing formal/informal assessments such as running records, student conferences,  portfolios, and other teacher created 
assessments to gain further insight for instructional planning. Spanish bilingual pedagogues utilize data from the Estrellita and 
Mondo guided reading program. Chinese bilingual pedagogues use literacy materials purchased through China Sprout.  In 
addition, data collected from standardized exams such as NYSESLAT,  NYS ELA, NYS Math and Science are analyzed.  This data 
allows us to notice and identify patterns across the grades which impacts our instructional decisions and focus.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

- Teachers meet weekly, during a "Professional Learning Period"  (PLP) in "Cohort" teams of about half the teachers on each 
grade (5-7 teachers). These teachers conduct Action Research Projects throughout the year, analyzing data to determine a 
central focus and question, and engaging in a cycle of inquiry to inform and monitor instructional and curricular assessments. 
- All staff has Monday professional development sessions, during which teachers meet in grades, across bands of two grades, 
and in vertical teams that span all grades within a specific content area (i.e. ENL, TBE, Special Education, etc.) 
- Educational consultants meet with teams and individual teachers on a regular basis to support math and literacy, with a 
specific focus on meeting the needs of English language learners. 
- There are structures in place for RtI and AIS, with one RtI provider and one AIS provider per grade. RtI and AIS teachers meet 
in teams together and also meet with grade teams to communicate about students and curriculum. Two of the RtI providers 
and two of the AIS providers have TESOL certification, and, as needed, provide ENL supports and mandated services.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
To help us meet our school's AYP for ELLs, we evaluate the success of our ENL/TBE programs by analyzing the growth of our 
students in each modality of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT. We also monitor our areas of needed improvement by analyzing 
formal/informal  assessments 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Interventions include push-in/pull-out ENL support, Newcomers Program, RTI, AIS, and Morning and Saturday Academy. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses various forms of data to guide instruction for ELLs such as: iReady reading and Math assessments, NYSESLAT 
and NYSITELL results, Fountas and Pinell assessment, conference notes, Fundations and Go Math unit assessments, and State 
ELA and Math scores.  Based on the data, the classroom teachers identify students that struggle in math and ELA. Teachers will 
have a variety of screeners to indicate which students need instruction. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Across the school, we look at data from the EDAT, as well as the RLAT, to determine placement and programming of ELLs. We 
also use these data points to inform groupings and selections for our newcomer and Saturday Academy programs for ELLs. For 
example, current data gathered through EDAT indicate that 36 students in the school regressed one (1) proficiency level, and 
230 students remained at the same proficiency level on the 2017 NYSESLAT. There are also 71 students in the school who are 
at a risk level of level 5 or greater according to the EDAT. These students were targeted for the Saturday Academy program.At 
the beginning of the year, teachers and administrators collaboratively review data from the previous year's assessments (ELA, 
Math, NYSESLAT). Throughout the year, teams of teachers and administrators periodically review data iReady assessments 
(which are administered three times per year - in September, January, and May) to monitor progress for ELLs and evaluate the 
effectiveness of our various programs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

At the beginning of the year, we hold meetings with teachers during which we review school-wide and grade-level data from 
state assessments, including the ELA, math, and NYSESLAT exams, and discuss adjustments made to programs as a result of 
these findings. We also hold specific meetings with ENL, TBE, and Dual Language teachers during October to review trends 
surfaced through the EDAT. Decisions are communicated in these team meetings, as well as through whole-staff Monday PDs, 
and structures such as the Staff Weekly Update, which is a letter sent out by the principal each week. 
Families are informed about adjustments to programs, and the rationale for these adjustments, through SLT meetings, family 
workshops, and monthly family letters sent by the principal. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school offers a combination of push-in and free-standing ENL classes. All Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 
standalone instruction for at least 4 periods per week and at least 4 periods per week of integrated ENL. All 
Transitioning and Expanding ELL students receive at least 4 periods per week of integrated ENL. Integrated ENL is 
either co-taught by a certified ENL teacher and a common branch-certified teacher, or taught by a classroom teacher 
dual-certified in ENL and common branches. Students are grouped in heterogeneously with other ELLs and also with 
non-ELLs and former ELLs. Placement is based on parent choice, NYSITELL scores, and NYSESLAT proficiency levels 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our school offers Spanish and Chinese bilingual classes.  Placement is based on parent choice, NYSITELL scores and 
NYSESLAT proficiency levels.  All classes are heterogeneously grouped. Through small group instruction, teachers 
provide students with the requisite percentage of home language instruction daily, based on NYSESLAT proficiency 
level.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our school offers Chinese and Spanish Dual Language classes in grades K and 1. Each year we will expand the program 
by one grade level in both languages.  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All ENL and Bilingual pedagogues are instructed to provide mandated minutes of ENL services, based on proficiency 
levels.Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction: 4 45-minute periods per week of standalone 
ENL and 4 45-minute periods per week of integrated ENL. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 4 45 minute periods 
per week of integrated ENL instruction. Commanding students receive 2 periods per week (90 minutes) of integrated ENL. 
Teachers are to reflect these ENL units in their program as per CR Part 154.  Bilingual teachers are also instructed to integrate 
mandated Home Language instruction in their program. Dual language classrooms provide ENL instruction in small groups and 
follow a balanced instructional model for both languages.In DL classrooms, all instruction is delivered every other day in the 
Home Language. This included reading and writing instruction in Spanish using the Estrellita program, and reading instruction 
in Chinese using home grown lessons, including phonics in pinyin. TBE classrooms have at least 180 minutes of HLA per week 
through HL literacy periods, as well as through at least two (2) Morning Meetings per week conducted in the home language, 
which include activities that focus on HLA and deepening speaking and listening skills in either Chinese or Spanish. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Go Math, Expeditionary Learning and teacher-created units based on science and social studies scope and sequence have all 
been implemented at our school for the past few years. These Common Core aligned programs provide various resources, 
scaffolding and differentiation options for our diverse learners. They focus on domain specific vocabulary and math language 
development. They include RtI scaffolding and ENL push-in/pullout to support our ELLs. Teachers are able to provide small 
group instruction within the framework of the programs. In ENL classrooms, instruction is delivered in English. The teacher 
may provide native language support as needed through translated texts or tools, and students may choose to read books in 
their home languages. In TBE classrooms, in addition to the HLA periods, at least two (2) content areas are offered in the home 
language, with translations and other supports provided in the home language (either Spanish or Chinese), as well as small 
group instruction in the home language. In DL classrooms, content is delivered every other day in the home language. In both 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

TBE and DL classrooms, the environment is print-rich in both the home languages and English, and classroom libraries include 
a range of books in the home languages. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELL students receive evaluation in their home language when possible by a certified pedagogue. A large percentage of our 
incoming students are Spanish or Chinese speaking. Teachers with bilingual extensions in these languages evaluate 
students  for fluency and placement, and to inform ongoing instruction throughout the year. All students in the school are 
given on-demand writing assessments during the year, and ELL students who can read and write in their home languages may 
also take these assessments in their home languages. Students are also assessed in their home languages throughout the year 
through regular conferring during the literacy period, through which teachers do running records in home languages to assess 
reading proficiency and growth. In DL classrooms, all formative and summative assessments are given in both English and the 
home language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We currently have 720 ELLs. Differentiation for the ELL subgroups begins with class/program placement.  We try to match 
students with the appropriate class and/or teacher.  Parental choice is also considered.  Some students receive small group 
instruction from ENL, AIS, RTI and Reading Recovery teachers.  Students are also invited to participate in Morning and Saturday 
Academy for math and ELA support. 
  a. SIFE students receive at least 4 periods of standalone ENL, and also receive additional academic intervention, through 
push-in support, Morning and Saturday programs. 
b. Newcomer ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction weekly.  They are engaged in a challenging theme-based curriculum 
which focuses on vocabulary development, phonics, phonemic awareness, close-reading strategies and academic 
concepts.  Also, the culture, native language and life experiences of the students are embedded throughout instruction. These 
activities are set up to build students’ academic English proficiency through scaffolded instruction. Classroom discourse is 
arranged in a manner to promote and develop language acquisition and academic concepts.  We also implemented a 
Newcomer program to assist Newcomers in acquiring language. 
c.     Developing ELLs receive similar instruction to newcomers; however, the work is more rigorous and fewer scaffolds are 
used, with close attention to the acquisition of Tier II academic language. When necessary, academic intervention, after 
school, Morning and Saturday programs are available to these students. 
d.     Long-term ELL instruction, while still rigorous, focuses on the students’ acquisition of academic language, phonemic 
awareness, reading and writing strategies, and organization skills.  Academic intervention, after school, Morning and Saturday 
programs are also available. 
e.  Former ELLs receive 2 periods of integrated ENL for 2 years after scoring CM on the NYSESLAT. This instruction is delivered 
through a push-in/pull-out model by teachers certified in ENL who collaborate with classroom teachers to provide appropriate 
scaffolds and supports. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs are programmed according to their proficiency levels.  In addition to receiving instruction that is aligned with their 
proficiency levels, lessons are often differentiated to address the acquisition of academic language, phonemic awareness, 
reading and writing strategies, and organization skills.  Further differentiation is provided to match the goals on these 
students’ individualized educational plans.  Additionally, modifications are provided as required by each student’s IEP.  A 
bilingual paraprofessional is available to students with disabilities as an alternative placement. A variety of instructional 
materials are used to support ELL-SWDs.  Technology is utilized with all ELL classes through the use of SMART boards and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

laptops and iPads.  In addition, the students use language and literacy software, such as Raz Kids, BrainPop and Bookflix.  To 
support ELLs in the content areas, language frames, bilingual dictionaries and native language glossaries are made 
available.  When available, books on CD or textbooks in the native language are provided 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All students have access to the same curriculum.  Special Education Teachers consult with the ENL providers and SETSS to 
ensure that ELLs receive appropriate intervention and language support. ELL-SWDs are provided with modifications and 
scaffolding strategies accordingly.  They are provided with strategies and support based on their IEP goals.  Many ELL SWDs are 
placed in self-contained 12:1, ICT classes, or mainstream as the least restrictive environment. The majority of ELL-SWDs receive 
push-in/pull-out small group support. A bilingual paraprofessional is available to students with disabilities as an alternate 
placement.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention is provided to ELLs in content areas through push-in/pull-out support by certified ENL teachers and academic 
intervention teachers. All teachers are trained in the content, the curricula, and strategies to support ELLs, and classroom 
teachers collaborate with push-in providers to provide targeted instruction. ENL teachers work in small groups with Entering 
and Emerging ELLs to support them in language acquisition and discipline-specific academic vocabulary. Academic 
intervention, RTI and Reading Recove specialists who have been trained in math and literacy intervention, work with 
heterogeneous groups of students to support them in language modalities while accessing the content. Teachers of bilingual 
classes, and certified ENL teachers who speak Spanish and Mandarin support students in their native language development 
through classroom instruction, small group intervention, and ongoing targeted intervention 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The school has purchased Fundations for the following school year 2017-18.   Teachers requested a curriculum that provides 
students with foundational skills for reading and writing emphasizing phonemic awareness.  Teachers create units of study 
aligned with Common Core as well as NYC Social Studies and Science Scope and Sequence.  All teachers are given RLAT data for 
students in their class and receive ongoing professional development on scaffolding for ELLs in mind so that they may adapt 
their curricula accordingly. The effectiveness of the new curricula will be evaluated through a review of data gathered from 
Fundations,  F+P, iReady and teacher-created unit assessments.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not close a bilingual program this year. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
•  We provide afterschool programs, Morning and Saturday academy.  •  Enrichment clubs took place 2X’s a week and were 
geared to address ELLs and provide opportunities for social interaction, conversational skills and creativity.   Teachers referred 
the students.•  11 ELL Title III Saturday classes were offered for specific ELL students K-5 who were identified by the teachers 
as needing extra language support.  •  Since implementing Core Knowledge for the past two years we have decided to 
discontinue the program in our building.  This year grades K-2 found it too lengthy and difficult to implement with our 
population who needs strong language support and foundational literacy skills. Next year, we will implement Fundations and 
teacher-created curriculum for Literacy.  
   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
•  Each classroom has a smart board, laptops and iPads which are used for instruction and support. •  ICT classrooms have two

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

TBE and Dual Language students are given access to bilingual dictionaries, books in their home language, and translations of 
tasks and directions. Dual language teachers use home language screeners and provide guided reading in the child's dominant 
language. TBE teachers conduct science and social studies lessons alternating between English and the students' home 
language (Chinese or Spanish). In TBE classes, running records are taken in the home language during independent reading 
time as well.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The school has chosen and refined curricula to target the specific learning needs all students at their respective grade levels. In 
the lower grades, classroom prioritizes developmentally-appropriate play-based activities through choice time, as well as 
instruction in foundational skills. In the upper grades, instruction focus on building independence and the development of 
academic and personal behaviors through rigorous performance tasks around key content. All teachers are provided with 
training in strategies appropriate to the ages and grade levels they teach, with particular focus on inclusive practices to provide 
access for ELLs into the curricula.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We have implemented a Newcomer program for ELLs which focuses on beginning language skills.  Additionally, we offer 
Saturday Academy for ELLs.  These programs are designed and instructed by ENL and bilingual teachers.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

d. Emergent literacy is taught in the child's home language and is sequential 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

- Using Responsive Classroom to support social/emotional and language development Professional development is facilitated 
by the administrative team, school-based literacy and math coaches, and a consultants. Professional learning sessions take 
place on Mondays after school. Teachers work with facilitators in small groups, determined by grade or content area, as well as 
areas of need identified through analysis of observation data. In addition to school-based professional development, ENL and 
bilingual pedagogues attend the annual SABE conference; and the Integrated Co-Teaching Workshop Series at Fordham 
University. All teachers engage in professional learning around the needs of students in meeting the expectations of the 
Common Core Learning Standards. ENL teachers receive targeted professional development. ENL teachers also attend 
professional learning and common planning sessions in which teachers deepen their understanding of standards-based 
curricula (including Fundations, Expeditionary Learning, and Go Math) and plan lessons to meet the needs of their students. 
Teachers also attend weekly Professional Learning Periods to collaborate in data-driven Action Research projects. Additionally, 
three cycles of staff-led Study Groups are held, in which teachers choose a topic of interest in order to deepen their 
pedagogical practices 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
For the minimum hours of ELL training, all staff is provided with professional learning opportunities that deepen their 
understanding of the NYSESLAT exam, ENL proficiency levels, and specific strategies to support needs of ELLs in their 
classrooms.  Since many of our ELLs and former ELLs are in integrated ENL settings, and the majority of our classroom teachers 
teach ELLs and/or formal ELLs, the staff is presented with best practices for ELLs that include methods for fair assessment, as 
well as  strategies and scaffolds that can be implemented in content-area classes.  Select staff are trained on how to score the 
NYSESLAT exams. Agendas are provided for teachers for all sessions and attendance is taken; all records are kept on file by the 
administrative team.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to scheduled parent-teacher conferences and the mandated parent orientation meetings with the intake team, 
parents of ELLs meet individually with the Parent Coordinator, ENL Coordinator, Family Worker, Assistant Principal, and, as 
needed, ENL and classroom teachers. These meetings address the ongoing needs of students as measured against their 
language proficiency assessment results and language development needs. The Parent Coordinators, ENL Coordinator, Family 
Worker, and other teachers and staff members are bilingual in English and Spanish or English and Chinese and can 
communicate and translate as needed. For parents who speak languages other than English, Spanish, or Chinese, translations 
are provided as needed.  Additionally, the school provides headsets to parents for translation. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL families have an opportunity to participate in the school community through a variety of activities, including Family 
Fridays, Parent Teacher Conferences, Family Workshops, the School Leadership Team, and the PTA. Families are also invited to 
classroom culminating events and holiday celebrations. The school offers ongoing workshops for all families, with a specific 
focus on families of ELLs. Workshop topics include: 
- ELL Orientation (for families of newly admitted ELLs) (October) 
- What is Dual Language (November) 
- Introduction to Estrellita Reading Program (December) 
- Building Language at Home (January) 
- Understanding the NYS ELA and Math Exams (March) 
- Understanding the NYSESLAT Exam (March/April) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

The school also offers workshops in supporting children in literacy and math on a semi-monthly basis, with each month 
centered on a different grade level. The Dual Language program holds regular family coffee hours, during which families get a 
chance to engage in literacy activities with the children. Interpretation in Spanish and Chinese is provided for all family 
engagement activities. 
ELL families are also invited to take part in the school's Adult ESL program, which is held on Saturdays and focuses on building 
English language proficiency while developing strategies to help families support their children's success.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, E. Jaela Kim, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

- Data on student home language, and family preference for written and spoken language is pulled from ATS into 
Excel from parent home language identification surveys via the RBIR, RCPL, and other ATS reports. This 
information is used to identify the preferred written and spoken language with families. All written 
communications home are translated into Spanish and Chinese and distributed to families as appropriate (families 
typically receive materials either in English and Chinese or English and Spanish.  

- Incoming kindergartners who are not yet in ATS are added to this in the plan via information recorded in school 
at time of registration on home language.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

- Teachers review the actual communications sent home against the working language they use with their 
students’ caregivers, and adjustments get made as necessary (for example, if the students’ caregivers are not 
English proficient even though parents are).  

- Chinese speaking parents were surveyed in 2016, via the PTA, and chose Simplified Chinese for written 
communication in Chinese. Student blue cards with Student Emergency Contact cards are used to identify oral 
interpretation to parents.  

- The school keeps records of staff language ability and uses in house resources, as well as professional 
interpretation, to meet the communication needs for our families. - For parent teacher conferences, we cross 
reference data using excel to assess interpreter need, using the home language preferences from ATS (RPCL, RBIR, 
RADL and others) to identify how many students in each class do not speak the language the teacher speaks. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Guidelines on working with interpreters is covered in the staff handbook. All staff are made aware of the 
interpretation hotline. However, Sunset Park School, PS 169 embraces our diverse community of many different 
languages. Working with Limited English Proficient families is embedded into every part of our mission, and is 
reinforced constantly in all aspects of our work. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school displays the DOE “Welcome” banner and Langauage Access brochure in many areas of the school. 
Teachers, parent coordinators and secretaries have copies of the handout. At parent teacher conferences, 
information on interpretation services are posted in multiple areas of the building. All staff are aware of the 
interpretation “hotline”. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the
