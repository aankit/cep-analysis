Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

West Side’s mission is to educate all students who are at risk. Our purpose is to develop economically self sufficient, 
socially conscious, critically thinking citizens. We strongly believe that every student is capable of success in a 
nurturing environment that respects individual effort and achievement. We provide an atmosphere, which features 
smaller class size, a supportive “family group” system, and opportunities for student internships and parental 
involvement. Our mission is to create an educational environment that will serve as a magnet to students who have 
been turned away/off by their previous schools.  
Our Community Values have been:

In the 2018-19 school year we plan to collaborate as a community to revisit and revise these core values. 
 
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Contextual information 
West Side High School is one of the oldest and largest transfer schools in NYC; we are proud that 2018-19 will be 
our 47th year. 

As a transfer school, we are a full-time high school designed to re-engage students who have dropped out or who 
have fallen behind in credits. 
Students are eligible if they meet the following criteria: 
● Be 16-21 years old 
● Have completed one year of high school 

On average students stay for about a year and a half, but we do have many who are with us anywhere from three 
months to several years depending on the number of credits and exams upon entry. 

Our academic year is structured in trimesters to allow for more opportunities to reengage, admit, and address the 
varying credit needs of our students. We will also make mid-cycle adjustments and continue intake as needed. 
Because of this, students sitting in the same classroom might have just arrived this month or this week, while 
others started the course in September and have been at West Side for years. As a result, our curriculum and 
instructional planning must continuously spiral in content, skills and school-wide strategies. 

We understand that students are coming to us from challenging, and often traumatic pasts, and therefore need to 
feel connected to the school within a short period of time; we need to build relationships immediately. One very 
clear and simple practice is that all adults in the building are addressed by their first names. While our average 
register throughout the year is about 450 students, in actuality, we see approximately 800-1000 students in a given 
academic year. 
It is not uncommon for a student to have taken and failed multiple Regents exams three, four, and five times. 
Additionally, many have enrolled in the same course and not earned credit multiple times. 

West Side by the numbers (based on Spring 2017 School Performance Dashboard): 
● 33% SWD’s mostly served in ICT settings 
● 65% OA/UC (overaged-under-credited) 
● 9% ENL population (2 ENL certified teachers) 
 
● We are participating in: 
○ Algebra for All 
○ College Access for ALL 
○ AVID (We’re an AVID certified school) 
○ Alliance for a Healthier Generation (Gold Medal Award) 
○ NYCDOE Restorative Justice Pilot program as a mentor school 
○ the LYFE program (Living for the Young Family) 
○ PSAL- Boys and Girls Basketball, Co-Ed Softball, and Girls Volleyball 

● College and Career Readiness Supports: 
○ OPTIONS Institute (Goddard Riverside CBO) to focus on Post-Secondary Readiness 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

○ College Now (John Jay for Spring Term) 
○ for SWD’s we work with the following agencies “Include NYC” and “ACCESS-VR” 
○ several college trips throughout the year 
○ collaborate with Goddard Riverside CBO to provide an on-site college/career counselor 
○ 2018-19 will be our first year with a LTW (Learning to Work) program 
 
● Wellness is one of our Community Core Values. To honor this: 
○ We believe that students will eat healthy if they’re involved in the growing and processing of their meals, we 
built a kitchen and our own garden. 
○ We encourage all students to eat healthy in the following ways: we use the alternative menu from the NYCDOE 
healthy school options, administrators and some staff members eat alongside students in the cafeteria each day. 
○ Any food that we serve staff and students meets criteria for healthy food, we make healthy breakfast food and 
snacks available to students throughout the day. 
○ We provide filtered water throughout the day for all staff, students, and visitors. 
○ We make physical fitness activities available for students and staff: Spin, Nia, Rugby, and AM fitness classes. 

● Additional Academic Supports and opportunities for credit accumulation: 
○ AM and PM course offerings each cycle 
○ All teachers are available during student lunch-time for office hours/tutoring 
○ After school drop-in tutoring 
○ Saturday Academy during select times of year 
○ Credit recovery is available for students who qualify 
○ Family Group frequently incorporates self-reflection and goal setting through the use of the “Yellow Sheets” 
(student friendly transcript trackers) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Most incoming students are age 17 and older when they transfer into West Side. Some students come from 
vocational schools; others from large, comprehensive high schools; still others from rigorous academic settings. Some 
students are returning from experiences in residential treatment or DFY facilities. Still others are returning to school 
after the birth of a child or an extended period of truancy. According to our 2017 School Performance dashboard we 
have 33% SWD; 9% ELL; 65% OAUC; and 27% Most-at-Risk students. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Framework for Great Schools 

West Side has made significant progress in all elements of the Framework for Great Schools . Our key areas of focus 
for the 2017-18 school year was to reflect on student work products generated in classrooms in order to revise our 
curriculum including the instructional strategies necessary to ensure that all students are able to meet rigorous 
learning targets. During he 2017-18 school year we also focused on increasing teacher leadership in professional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

learning. Collaboratively, the teachers developed this year's instructional focus: Students will engage in tasks that 
are both cognitively challenging and accessible.  

Our area of celebration from our 2017-18 QR was 1.4 Maintain a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that 
supports the academic and personal growth of students and adults. We excel in creating and maintaining a school 
community that supports our students in all areas of their lives, not just the parts that they are tested on. West 
Side High School has three times received Gold Recognition nationally by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation for 
our work around wellness. In addition to this, we developed a set of community values that we use as the basis of 
our restorative justice approach to student discipline. As a result of this work, our school tone has improved. We 
have enjoyed the reputation for having a positive tone in our school for many years, but this approach has helped 
us move from “good to great.” Currently we are a Mentor School for a number of other high schools who are 
piloting restorative practices in their school and we were identified to be a case study of best practices for school 
climate, tone, and student discipline by the Center for Court Innovation. We will continue to deepen this work as 
well.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to our 2017-18 Quality Review Report our area of focus [Developing] is 1.1 Ensure engaging, rigorous, and 
coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards 
and/or content standards. The findings indicated that, "Rigorous habits and higher-order skills are inconsistently 
emphasized across curricula. Additionally, planning is beginning to reflect an effort to provide diverse learners access 
to the curricula and tasks." 

 

Along with the findings from our QR, the 2017- 18 School Environment Survey indicates that while 94% of responding 
students feel they are being made to think critically, only 57% responded that they are challenged in most of their 
classes. This is an increase in both data points from our 2016-17 School Environment Survey. Specifically a 10% point 
increase in the students feeling challenged in most of their classes which met our 2017-18 CEP Goal 5a. 

 

This year we collaboratively developed our Instructional Focus: Students engage in tasks that are both cognitively 
challenging and accessible. To accomplish this, our work will focus on professional learning and inquiry to develop 
rigorous tasks that address diverse learners by both scaffolding and extending the instruction for students at all levels 
of skill and knowledge. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
To collaboratively create challenging and accessible tasks aligned to the Common Core Standards and to improve the 
quality of instruction, teacher teams will engage in 2-3 cycles of inquiry by June 2019, resulting in a 10 percentage point 

increase in the number of students who agree (on the School Environment Survey in the Spring of 2019) that they are 
being challenged in most classes.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Beginning with our admissions interview and new student orientation, students and their families are introduced to 
our community values which include an emphasis on rigorous instruction and high expectations. Our parent 
coordinator and a team of teachers will hold a series of workshops for families beginning in September and continuing 
through the first trimester to discuss initiatives. We will also structure our teacher-family engagement time to include 
discussion of rigorous instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our strength lies in the relationships between students and adults, students and students, and in our restorative 
practices. The 2017-18 School Environment Survey indicates that 94% of students say that there is at least one adult 
in the school that they can confide in. Our priority need is to foster the same relationship between students and their 
classroom teachers. Specifically we want to address the following data from the 2017-18 School Environment Survey 
and QR: 

 

  75% of students say that teachers notice if they have trouble learning something. 
  81% of students say that teachers explain things a different way if they don’t understand something. 
  69% of teachers say that adults at their school teach students the organizational skills needed to be 

prepared for their next level. 

  69% of students say that their teachers support them when they are upset. 

 

 

"While there is evidence of planning for differentiated materials, student groupings, and additional 
supports so that the school’s diverse learners can have equal access to instruction, the depth of this 
planning is inconsistent." QR 1.1 (Developing)  
"As per this lesson plan, it would be possible for students to complete the task begun the prior day and 
unless voluntarily informing the teacher that they were done, there could be substantial time spent off-
task." QR 1.1 (Developing)  

Our goal will be for teachers to be aware of student academic and emotional needs in order to create a supportive 
classroom environment where students have access to the learning and feel safe to take academic risks.. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will see a 5 percentage point increase in each of the following School Quality Survey responses: 

  75% of students say that teachers notice if they have trouble learning something. 
  81% of students say that teachers explain things a different way if they don’t understand something. 
  69% of teachers say that adults at their school teach students the organizational skills needed to be 

prepared for their next level. 

  69% of students say that their teachers support them when they are upset.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Beginning with our admissions interview and new student orientation, students and their families are introduced to 
our community values which include an emphasis on honoring democracy, self, and others. At this time and 
throughout the year parent engagement activities, both one on one and large group, focus on topics related to family 
group, circle practice, and communication skills. Parents and families are members of Tier II and III restorative circles. 
Family Group teachers serve as the primary family contact for the entire time a student is at EARWSHS. We will also 
structure our teacher-family engagement time to include discussion of school climate. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 

Circular 6 assignments are used for every teacher to participate in a first period common planning (which 
includes a weekly teacher team meeting led by a Family Group Coach) as well as daily instructional tutoring 
during students' lunch period. Weekly after school professional learning time will also be used. Compensatory 
time positions are created and SBO approved in order to staff to curriculum development and instruction. 
Circular 6 time allow creates "office hours" for student support in academic classes.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By the midpoint of the school-year (February) administrators and neighborhood coaches will have visited 100% of 
Family Groups at least twice to determine the frequency and strength of the use of restorative practices in Family 
Group lessons. Instructional Professional Learning Team Leaders will conduct and organize inter-visitations with the 
administration through the lens of accessibility to rigorous instruction.  

This information will inform lesson planning and teacher coaching (from neighborhood coaches and administrators) 
from February to June 2019. This information will be analyzed along with a review of the Family Group student point 
rubrics.  

Additionally, the Peacekeeping Log will be maintained and reviewed periodically.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Feedback from our 2017-18 QR indicates these strengths [3.4 High Expectations (Well-Developed)]: 

 

School leaders consistently communicate high expectations and provide training to the entire staff. Teacher 
teams and staff establish a culture for learning.  

  Communication and PD around high expectations contribute toward a culture of mutual accountability. 

Teachers foster student ownership of high expectations through the family group process.  

 

School leaders have supported school improvement initiatives through sessions on curriculum design, 
engaging students, designing rigorous questions, and engaging students in making their thinking visible. 

 

Although this feedback highlights our strong culture of professional learning, the following data from 2017-18 
School Quality Survey reveals that our priority needs are to develop more coherence, follow through, and impact. 

  62% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and 

coherent. 

  63 % of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have included enough time 

to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 

  77% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on 

professional development.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will see a 5 percentage point increase in each of the following School Quality Survey responses: 

  62% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and 

coherent. 

  63 % of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have included enough time to 

think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 

  77% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on 

professional development.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As seen in feedback from our 2017-18 QR, one of our strengths is in building capacity for teacher leaders. It states, 
"the instructional cabinet includes school leaders along with volunteer representatives from each department. 
Together, they communicate schoolwide instructional goals, monitor progress, and plan for the department and 
working group inquiry meetings and weekly after-school professional learning sessions." 4.2 Teacher Teams and 
Leadership Development [Proficient] 

Additionally, the 2017-18 School Quality Survey indicates that 97% of teachers say that the principal makes clear to 
the staff his or her expectations for meeting instructional goals.  

 

Although this feedback highlights our structure for teacher leaders, the following data from 2017-18 School Quality 
Survey reveals that our priority is to strengthen the alignment between the instructional vision and school culture. 

  83% of teachers say that the principal communicates a clear vision for this school.  

  80% of teachers say that it is clear how all of the programs offered are connected to their school's 

instructional vision.  

  80% of teachers say that the principal encourages feedback through regular meetings with parent and 

teacher leaders.  

 

 

 

 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will see a 5 percentage point increase in each of the following School Quality Survey responses: 

  83% of teachers say that the principal communicates a clear vision for this school.  

  80% of teachers say that it is clear how all of the programs offered are connected to their school's instructional 

vision.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

West Side High School has had tremendous difficulty engaging parents. This week's open school event had only 10 
parents attend. We notified them by mail and by phone on multiple occasions, but we had an extremely low turnout. 
What we have noticed over the years is that parents are very interested in talking periodically about their student's 
progress toward graduation. We also get a better turnout for college and financial aid. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  

By June 2019, we will see a 5 percentage point increase in the number of parents completing the School Quality 
Survey, from 6% to 11%.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
We have extensive opportunities for professional learning at EARWSHS. In addition to daily professional development 
and common planning/Inquiry, we have hired a coach to work with teachers during the school day. We participate in 
the professional development provided by the Transfer School Superintendent’s Office and the Manhattan Borough 
Fields Support Center. Teachers are also able to choose from a wide variety of professional learning opportunities 
which include conferences, institutes and workshops during the school year and summer. 
 
In order to recruit highly qualified teachers, we have partnerships with Hunter College where graduate education 
students are placed in our school to complete classroom observation and serve as tutors. We also encourage our 
current teachers to supervise student teachers.  
 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We have a literacy and math consultant. Each one works with teachers once a week. Over half of our teachers have 
been trained in AVID during summer institutes, and we attend other professional conferences and institutes when 
funding allows.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Our teachers and school leaders engage in cycles of inquiry that focus on looking at student work generated from 
common assessment in order to adjust instruction. Professional development focuses less on the use of assessment 
results to improve instruction as opposed to focusing on strategies and interventions that can be used to address the 
findings of the assessments. All teachers meet in both departmental and interdisciplinary teacher teams to engage in 
this work. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. West Side High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Elementary and Secondary School (ESEA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. 

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

West Side High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;

  West Side High School ELL students are serviced in the Title III program by two teachers who 
has his/her ESL license. One of these teachers is also licensed in Social Studies and one is also 
licensed in English.  In addition, content area teachers receive push-in ESL support and 
professional development from the assistant principals. 
Our Title III supplemental program will take place during our after school tutoring sessions. 
NYSESLAT, Regents scores, and student work indicate areas of need in academic reading, 
writing, and vocabulary.  In addition, our ELLs need support in Math literacy.   
West Side High School also has after school tutoring to provide supplemental instruction that 
includes services for ELLs. This service provides our ELL students the necessary rigorous 
instructional support to improve college readiness. During the 1.5 hour block designed 
specifically for ELLs and former ELLs that focus on study skills, academic and test specific 
vocabulary development, identification of key words in complex passages, as well as the 
organization of written responses to performance tasks.  ESL teachers will support content area 
teachers in planning for academic reading and writing during the Saturday academy.  
Instruction will be provided in English with native language support as needed.  Our items 
purchased from title III funds will include consist leveled non-fiction text, subscriptions, and 
other classroom materials that will support ELLs in all of their classrooms.

Professional learning benefits ESL teachers in advancing their ELL practices in relation to their 
content area. The teachers who receive specific ELL training teach courses that end in Regents 
exams, English Selectives, Social Studies, Science, and Math classes. 
As a result of our work in previous years, we will again hire an Generation Ready ESL specialist 
consultant to work with us in the area of academic language development. Professional 
development coaching focusing on our ESL teachers will be spread out over a number 
of days and will help with content and strategies for ELLs. Coaching will also be directed at all 
classroom teachers. 
The consultant will also present a workshop for all teachers that will discuss the needs of 
ELLs and provide instructional strategies to support them in all classrooms. 
Additionally, the certified ESL teachers participate in two weekly teacher team meetings. 
Department teams look at  student work generated through common tasks and are reviewed with 
particular attention the needs of ELLs and former ELLs. All teachers focus on discussion and 
engagement  protocols to help them address the unique needs of ELLs.

  Our ELL students came to our transfer school to realize their goal of graduation in a different 
instructional environment. Their parents are eager to understand graduation requirements, the 
grading system, college choices and financial aid. They have expressed difficulties in coping 
with their children who are being raised in the United States. Workshops are organized around 
these themes. 
Parents are notified of these meetings in Spanish (the predominant home language of our ELL 
students) and English. We have ongoing translation services for school documents, postings, 
meetings and workshops. Our Spanish teacher, the bilingual parent coordinator, and other 
bilingual staff members communicate with parents about outreach events in their native 
language, Spanish and languages other than English. Procedures are in place for bilingual staff 
members to speak with parents/guardians in their native language. 
Topics covered are: "When will my ELL child graduate? Reviewing your child's transcript", 
"How to listen so teens can talk and how to talk so teens can listen", "Preventing your child from 
substance abuse" as well as college application and financial aid training.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses department created formative assessments for each unit of study.  The student work is analyzed during 
weekly meetings and intervention strategies are determined based on the findings.  Our ELLs require support in reading 
comprehension, academic vocabulary, and written and oral expression.  Our interdisciplinary teacher teams will collect 
baseline data in areas of student discussion and student revision. Based on this data, teacher teams will create specific 
interventions to support student discussion and revision. These two target areas are parts of our instructional focus that are a 
struggle for our ELLs. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

Teachers meet weekly in both department and interdisciplinary teacher teams. The different teams share finding with the full 
staff  at least once a month. Additionally, we will use the assistance of a consultant to provide targeted support to our two ENL 
teachers. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Frequently, our ELLs are our highest performing subgroup and they out-perform all other subgroups including "all 
students."  Three years ago, we noticed that ELLs were not out-performing the other students in English, we hired a social 
studies teacher who is also licensed ESL teacher in order to support students with the literacy demands of the US and Global 
Regents. We gather this data from departmental common assessments. Additionally, since most of our students have taken 
Regents exams multiple times, we are able to use item analysis and long response data from these exams as a progress 
measure. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers meet weekly in department teams to share data and discuss interventions. Department teachers also share the 
intervention work and data collected during interdisciplinary team meetings. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
NA    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use ELA and other Regents data to evaluate 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

   We have a STAND ALONE (aka free standing) ESL program and certified ELL teachers in different departments: 
Science, Social Studies.  Our classes are ungraded.  The classes are heterogeneous with mixed proficiency (high 
intermediate to Advanced). These classes meet for one hour each day. Ell students are programmed to be in these 
content regents classes depending on their programs.  They are in an ELL/ELA transitional English class with Helene 
Papageorge who is ELL certified with Jean McTavish for support.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            We have an ELA transitional teacher who uses ELL strategies and methodologies in the class, a Social Studies teacher 
who is ESL licensed.  Intermediate and advanced ELL learners have 300 minutes per week of either or both, Electives, ELL/ELA, 
Global Studies with certified ESL teachers.  Classes target Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels and students are 
grouped heterogeneously in ungraded classes.  Students also take Spanish/NLA.  Each class is for one hour.  Depending on 
their graduation requirements they are taking taking various content classes with ELL certified teachers.  ESL classes are part of 
the students requirements.  All programming for ELL students are preslugged for these classes before actual programming 
begins. 
    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    ELL students who have received 3-6 years of service are earmarked for leveled content area texts, differentiated instruction, 
extra tutoring during lunchtime for individual attention, scaffolded tasks, understanding cognate, conventions and engaging 
materials including texts from their cultural heritages, AVID strategies, Cornell notetaking-listening skills, and college 
readiness, resume writing, research papers.  All coursework is aligned with the Common Core Standards.         
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ESL certified teachers consistently evaluate students in their native languages using informal assessments.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  We do not have SIFE students. The Special Needs coordinator, Caroline, will implement the SIFE instructional plan when the 
need exists.   SIFE parents will receive weekly phone calls to update them on their child's progress.  SIFE students will receive 
individual attention from their family group advisors.  SIFE students will also receive the benefit of having team-teaching 
classes.  
b.  We do not have newcomers at our school.  We are a transfer school and take students who are overage and 
undercredited.  However, newcomers receive instruction from ELL certified teachers, tutoring during lunch and after school, 
and direct instruction to improve their basic literacy skills.   
c.  Students who have received services for 4-6 years are services with ESL methods and strategies revolving around the 
acquisition of academic and reading/writing skills, scaffolded essay writing, fiction and non fiction leved and age appropriate, 
analyzing literature, conventions of English, cognate awareness.  Students receive differentiation based on their performance 
on the NYSESLAT> 
d.  Long term L's receive ELA prep and or electives in College Reading/Writing, as well as college/career skill building. 
e.  Special Needs students and former ELLs receive an enriched curriculum based on their performance on NYSESLAT and their 
IEP's.  Graphic organizers, leveled texts, one on one instruction, content area support, lunchtime tutoring, regents and RCT 
prep, career and college skills.  
Test accomodations of time and one half are given to all ELL  and former ELL students.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teacher teams are working to address reading strategies and vocabulary acquisition.  Classrooms use differentiated and 
leveled texts to promote ELL development and improve literacy skills.  Students are taught to use assistive technology and 
application s that facilitate reading and writing as well as improve memorization such as the Solo Suite and Quizlet.           

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students are scheduled according to their IEPs.  We offer a self contained ELA class and Intergrated Co-teaching in each subject 
area. West Side strives to schedule student into the least restrictive environment.  Teachers meet on a daily basis in teams to 
discuss instruction and ensure the needs of all students are being met.       
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  We have a free standing ESL program and certified ELL teachers in different departments: Science, Social Studies.  Our classes 
are ungraded.  The classes are heterogeneous with mixed proficiency (high intermediate to Advanced). These classes meet for 
one hour each day. Ell students are programmed to be in these content regents classes depending on their programs.  They are 
in an ELL/ELA transitional English class with Helene Papageorge who is ELL certified with Principal Jean McTavish for 
support.   In addition to our classes, students can get extra support from their teachers in any content area by attending 
tutoring at lunch and after school, by attending PM or AM school classes.  All services are offered in English only.  The above 
mentioned interventions are available in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are implementing the new Educating Powerful Writers:  An Integrated Scope and Sequence for High School Writing.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We will continue to deliver the services we have in the past, but the curriculum mentioned above will replace teacher 
authored unit plans.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
In a transfer school, all of our students have academic challenges.  As such, we have one to one tutoring available every day 
during our student lunch and 4 days a week after school.  We can also pull students out of class for intensive help as 
needed.  Saturday school and vacation school are also available if our budget allows.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We use Ipads, Chromebooks, as well as traditional traditional computers and interactive Smartboards.   All classrooms have 
the Solo suite available which includes a text reader and writing supports     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ELL certified teachers consistently evaluate students in their native languages.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

As a non graded transfer school,  all of our services/resources correspond to the ELL's age level.  Our services/resources are 
respectful and realistic.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We use Ipads, Chromebooks, as well as traditional traditional computers and interactive Smartboards.   All classrooms have 
the Solo suite available which includes a text reader and writing supports     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

We have rolling admissions at our school.  As students enter the school, we hold orientation sessions for both parents and 
students in order to help them transition to the new school setting.  We focus on supporting all students academically and 
socially.  Our social workers and parent coordinators run orientation workshops throughout the year to help students identify 
key adults and resources available to support them in our community.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is the only language we offer.  We have levels for Native Speakers.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

NA   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
We provide group and individual professional development for all teachers of ELL students.  They have access to all resources 
available to chart ELL progress (NYSESLAT scores disaggregated, disaggregated regents scores, Family Goup attendance charts 
which includes academic progress,.  Teachers learn about ELL methodology and strategies: scaffolding texts, concept mapping, 
tackling academic reading and vocabulary, writing conferencing)  and support with the Common Core Standards performance 
indicators.  Our students have already attended other high schools and made the transition.  Our professional learning occurs 
every Monday afternoon and Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings throughout the year.  We send teacher leaders, the 
PC, and administrators out to ELL PDs when they are made available throughout the year.  For example, last week, we sent a 
math teacher and a science teacher to DOE sponsored PD on supporting ELLs in the respective content areas. 
 Teachers of ELLs participate in inquiry teams that focus on the Common Core Standards and College and Career expectations    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
NA.   We are a high school, so we transition students to college or career training.  Our transition work with students begins 
with our orientation and ends with articulation to college or career training.  Our Family Group class offers group guidance and 
academic advisement.  We have a team of 5 social workers to address more serious social emotional problems.  Our 2 
guidance counsellors support students in selecting a post secondary experience.   
We have three types of professional development for teachers.  Our working groups focus of aligning our curriculum and our 
pedagogy to the Common Core Standards.  Our Departments work on deepening the work of the working groups.  Teachers 
learn about ELL methodology and strategies: scaffolding texts, concept mapping, tackling academic reading and vocabulary, 
writing conferencing)  and support with the Common Core Standards performance indicators.  Currently, we focusing on 
accountable talk, classroom discussions and scaffolds, and growth mindsets.  We do offer daily support to ELL teachers  in their 
first period family group meeting.  Teacher teams meet every morning for professional development.  This professional 
development lasts 40 minutes each day.   Teachers also meet every Monday afternoon for 45 minutes after school.   We keep 
digital copies of all agendas and attendance in Evernote.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We hold individual parent conferences with for all of our students.  All of the student's teachers are present at the meeting to 
discuss student language development and progress across content areas.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At all of our parent outreach activities we have bilingual staff and teachers communicating with our ELL parents.  Flyers, and 
phone calls home are conducted in Spanish and English.  We have college night for our parents, Financial Aid seminars, Pupil 
Path training, and celebration dinners with the Parent Coordinator.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jean Mctavish, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We have a questionnaire that asks parents their language preference in receiving written communication and in 
orally communicating with our school. Each student is interviewed in person prior to admission to our school. 
Parents must attend this interview with their student. If a parent is not available, we check the ATS report of 
Preferred Languages 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
