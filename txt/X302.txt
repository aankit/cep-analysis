Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Luisa Dessus Cruz (LDC), MS x302 is unique zone middle school that prides ourselves on accepting all students from 
diverse learning and socio-economic backgrounds. Our philosophy is all children can learn and will be able to function 
as productive members of society. Each teacher believes in accepting the child holistically. This means our staff

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

At LDC, MS x302 we have made tremendous progress in trust, rigorous instruction, supportive environment, and 
strong family ties. This is evident on the School Survey 2017-2018. We are going to continue to work on rigorous 
instruction as we are not satisfied with the data reports. Our goal is to increase student proficiency rating by 10 
percent.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths:  

An area of strength that was recognized according to the recent NYSED School Report Card: 

We are no longer a focus school. We are a school in good standing 

Another area noted in the 2017 school survey was the following: 

- The school creates and adapts cohesive curricula aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards strategically 
integrates the instructional shifts, and reflects upon and refines curricula to address the needs of all learners and 
incorporate levels of rigor. 

- The majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations. Distributed leadership 
structures are in place. 

The last strength of our school is the register projections as a zoned middle school.  

We have continuously have surpasses the register projections for the last three years.  

Needs:  

Student with disability tend to perform lower than the general education students even though they receive at risk 
support, I-Ready targeted intervention, tier I and tier II interventions.  

- On the 2017 Math and ELA state cut score results in grade 6- 8 our SWD students did not meet the city's 
promotional criteria. In ELA 97 SWD out of 147 SWD students did not meet the cut scores whereas in Math 84 SWD 
students out of 147 SWD students did not meet the cut scores.  

- On average the SWD students' functional levels according to their IEPs range from the second to the fourth grade 
level in grades 6-8.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 20% reduction of level 1’s earned by our SWD and ELL population on the State exam as a 
result of intense , tailored response to intervention and professional development.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH).

Researched Based Instructional Program:  

All Students 

1 . Workshop Model: Mathematics and ELA teachers will adhere 
to research based practices to be used in the workshop class in 
order to provide a balanced literacy and mathematics classroom. 
Following a workshop class will help to ensure that students are 
achieving mastery. In the workshop class it is expected that 
students respond to instruction, receive immediate feedback, 
and are allowed to discuss and challenge classmates and their 
own thinking. Teachers are expected to communicate clearly and 
explicitly model the skills/strategies they want students to 
practice. Teachers will develop their own direct instruction 
lessons by breaking the desired concept into smaller tasks and 
then developing scripted, fast-moving sessions, depending of the 
readiness of each student. 

2. Pedagogical Moves that are needed to ensure that the 
workshop class is a success:  

a. Designing Coherent Instruction-Teachers will design lessons 
that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. All 
aspects of instruction are to be aligned and follow a specific 
structure. The lesson outcomes, the activities, and the lesson 
assessments are to be aligned and demonstrate prior lessons 
and misconceptions. Activities provided for students will be 
aligned to the desired instructional outcome, and differentiated 
based on the needs of students. Teachers will continue to use 
data from various sources to plan instructional lessons including 
conferencing with students.  

b. Incorporating Discussion and Questioning Techniques-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teachers will provide challenging and engaging questions. This 
can be used to stimulate peer discussion and encourage students 
to explore and refine their understanding of key concepts. One 
protocol that will be focused upon is the integration of Socratic 
Seminars.

c. Using Assessments to Drive Instructions-  

Teachers will use assessments throughout their instruction to 
measure student growth and make informed decisions about 
curriculum and targeted small group instruction. Systems that 
will help are looking at student work, pre and post assessments, 
end of unit test/tasks, entrance and or exits slips, etc. This 
information will be also used to group students on a quarterly 
basis. Findings will also be used to drive one to one and small 
group conferencing. Data provided will also help teachers to 
reflect on best practices, and data driven instruction. 

 

d. Implementation of I-Ready, a supplemental program - 
Teachers will use the data to determine exactly where to focus 
their instructional time to ensure all students are on track to 
meeting rigorous expectations of the Common Core Standards. 
Data from this source will also be used to help teachers design 
coherent instruction. Students' progress data is monitored to 
inform instruction and grouping decisions. Data provided will 
also help teachers to reflect on best practices, and data driven 
instruction.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Professional Development:  

Math and ELA Handbook will outline the expectation of the 
classroom and the pedagogical moves expected at Middle School 
x302.  

· During common planning and the Monday Professional 
Development Days teachers review Videos focusing around 
direct instruction, best practices to ask questions and to increase 
student-to-student discussions in the classroom.  

· Teachers will participate in inter-class visitations with specific 
focus the different phases of the lesson. 

· Teachers will meet with lead teachers, mentors, and 
administrators on a monthly basis, receive feedback and next 
steps. 

· Teachers, parents, and students will receive training in the use 
of I Ready in the Math/ ELA classroom. 

· Teachers will participate in workshops focused around 
designing coherent instruction, student engagement and 
questioning and discussion techniques.

Math & ELA 
Teachers, 

Teachers will introduce Academic Vocabulary  

Teachers will demonstrate through the use of Word Walls, and 
weekly use of academic vocabulary words when speaking and 
writing, including the use of multiple meanings. Teachers will 
encourage students to offer bilingual support to each other. 
Students will be provided with visual cues, graphic 
representations, gestures, and pictures. Teachers will help 
students to identify key phrases that will support them with 
comprehending programs (sum, difference, etc.). 

Teachers will build students Background Knowledge  

Math teachers will modify the language complexity of language 
and rephrase math problems. Guide students to cross out the 
unnecessary vocabulary in word problems. Build knowledge 
upon students’ knowledge using real world examples. Use 
manipulative purposefully to help with students’ cognitive 
development. 

Increase Students’ Language In the Content Area  

Teacher will have students to students translate symbols into 
words, and write the sentence out. This will be incorporated 
throughout the lesson. Teacher will provide students with math 
sentence starters. Students will share problem-solving strategies 
with their peers. Students will use S.O.L.V.E. as a problem solving 
strategy. Teachers will incorporate writing activities such as 
reflection pieces following:  

Scaffold Activities - teachers will provide all students with 
activities that will support their academic growth. Teachers will 
use the On Line Glencoe Resource to support diverse learners. 
Examples of this are tiered End of Unit Task, differentiating 
lessons by content, process, and product.  

Parent Involvement-  

Teachers will support families in understanding the math 
curriculum for their child’s grade level, and how math is taught 
to their children. This will be done by introducing parents to the 
curriculum through a “Parent Letter” and “Meet and Greet” 

Jupiter Grades will serves as a system to provide parents with 
clear information, monitor the completion of homework, exams, 
and help their child develop positive attitudes about math.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Area of Strength: 

LDC is a safe environment and inclusive culture that supports progress toward the school goals. The 2018 Learning 
Survey revealed that 91% of the students, a 3% increase over 2017 levels, reported that they felt safe in hallways, 
bathrooms and the cafeteria. Further analysis revealed that 66% of the students, an increase of 28% over 2017 levels, 
stated that most students treat each other with respect. Additionally, as per the Quality Snapshot, 96% of teachers 
feel the principal works hard to create a sense of community. 

Area of Need: 

Based on conversation with the principal, parent association president, and with the parent coordinator, parent 
participation in workshops have slightly increased for the 2017-2018 school year, but did not meet the SLT 
projections, which was for an average of 20 parents to attend workshops. 

  The SLT attempted to address this concern and continues to formulate ideas to strengthen the numbers by 

 

implementing and developing workshops that parents would like to attend based on questionnaires. 
Signature sheets demonstrate that on average fewer than 20 parents attend the parent workshops offered at 
the school. 

Structures to support the whole child: 

As it relates to parent engagement, the SLT, parent executive board members, and the student government shared 
possible activities to increase parent engagement monthly. The three entities suggested the following: Visit to cultural 
institutions, parent/student celebrations/dances, and rummage drives/giveaways. Each entity have created sub-
committees to lead the activities. Three times a year the three entities will meet to assess the parent participation.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20 

 

By June 2019 20% of the students in each grade will show improvement in their attendance as per the attendance 
reports generated from ATS, state performance levels , and/or course work as per the Jupiter Grades System as a 
result of monthly celebrations and targeted attendance intervention.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

An analysis of the NYSELAT assessment for the 2017, and 2018 school year results show that students are moving one 
proficiency level one the NYSELAT but not on the ELA and Math assessment. Students are increasing their scale scores 
but are not moving one proficiency level. The instructional team decided to send a survey to all staff members to get 
feedback on the professional development and the support the instructional team can provide to them that will in 
turn benefit our students.  

Based on the survey results and the review of the data sets, the instructional team shared with the SLT the tentative 
professional development plan that would support our students achievement. Some decisions included the need to 
have 4 common planning meetings and one grade meeting a week; the importance of partnering new teachers with 
seasoned teachers; consistent routines on developing teacher content knowledge by having lesson plan clinics and 
affording them time to visit those colleagues who are consistently implementing pedagogical moves.  

Our expected outcomes is to have teachers collaborate on units of study, lesson plans, and texts that include 
differentiated learning activities that will allow ELLs and SWD's to develop and practice the language and skills 
through required to be actively involved in their learning process. Another expected outcome is to have teachers 
provide feedback to one another; to take risks in practicing new research based pedagogical approaches; and to share 
and invite colleagues to visit their classroom.  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 70% of the teachers (n=29) will participate in PLC's on planning and preparation resulting in an increase of 
one HEDI level as measured by the MOTP scores in ADVANCE.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths cited as “Areas of Celebrations” in our most recent Quality Review, 2016, and in the 2018 school survey 
were :  

School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff and provide training. School leaders 
and staff effectively communicate to students and parents expectations connected to a path to college and career 
readiness. For example, Parents stated they are highly pleased with the consistent communication with staff, which 
they believe ensures their children receive what they need to graduate 

The school creates and adapts cohesive curricula aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards strategically 
integrates the instructional shifts, and reflects upon and refines curricula to address the needs of all learners and 
incorporate levels of rigor. For example, Common lesson structures for the use of a 60-minute workshop model and 
24-minute stations are designed to be used school-wide with Common Core-aligned materials and resources, tiered 
differentiation, Do Now, learning target, success criteria, possible pitfalls, guided questions, mini lesson, group work, 
independent practice, and closure; Teachers collaborate during a lesson-plan clinic to create curricula that are more 
coherent. Peer Instructional Coaches also provide teachers with actionable feedback based on student work and data.  

Across the school, common assessments and rubrics aligned to the curricula are utilized to identify student 
performance and progress toward goals. For example, across grades and subjects, students keep their work in binder 
portfolios that include their proficiency levels, goals, strategies, and supports provided to achieve scores for tasks, 
which list the Common Core Learning Standards and task description; Teachers provide students with feedback on 
their work and post it on bulletin boards using TC rubric/checklist, inside and outside the classrooms. The actionable 
feedback, rooted in the rubric language, is written on the rubric with ratings, and includes highlights and areas to 
improve; In the instructional teams, teachers stated that their function is to collaboratively look at student work using 
the “wow, wonder, and trends” protocol. A teacher team demonstrated the next step in this protocol and determined 
when to re-teach distributive property within their curriculum map.  

Needs :  

Based on the recent quality review, it behooves the school to support teachers by providing an array of professional 
development workshops that will address the area of focus noted in the quality review.  

Across the vast majority of classes all students are not sufficiently required to make their thinking visible or engage in 
high levels of discussion leading to their ownership of learning. For example, not all students had the opportunity to 
demonstrate ownership of their work. pacing prevented some students from presenting their work, missing 
opportunities to demonstrate their thinking and ownership.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will create tiered instructional goals for each lesson in 
order to accommodate the different ability levels in the 
classroom. Differentiated learning activities and resources 
designed to engage and challenge students at their appropriate 
cognitive levels will be utilized. Students will engage in guided 
reading at least three times per week with high-interest texts at 
their instructional level. Students will engage in independent 
reading at least three times a week with high-interest texts at 
their independent reading levels. Targeted small-group 
instruction will take place at least three times per week to 
address struggling learners with common areas of concern such 
as basic reading and writing skills. Individual conferences with 
students to discuss current strengths, weaknesses, and academic 
goals will happen weekly. Students will receive personalized 
instruction from the “I-Ready,” interactive web based program. 
“MyOn” digital library will provide students with access to over 
4,000 titles, which are recommended to them based on interest 
and lexile level.  

We will engage in “ Data Driven ” instruction and will create a 
calendar to schedule bi-weekly in which we analyze data from 
common interim assessments or look at student work from 
common performance tasks. After the data or student work 
samples are analyzed and trends are identified, an action plan 
will be created to address the areas of concern that address the 
instructional focus- making thinking visible.  

Longevity goals will be created for each grade in order to 
formally document what skills/strategies/standards have been 
addressed by that particular grade. This information will be 
shared across grade levels so teachers can design curriculum that 
does not re-teach the skills/strategies/standards that have been 
taught in earlier grades or in previous units.  

Student writing samples are shared between grades in order to 
inform teachers of the quality of work that students are 
producing in earlier or later grades. This activity enables teachers 
to adjust their expectations and instructional goals based on 
what students learned in previous grades and what they are 
struggling with in later grades. It allows all teachers to assess

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength: 

According to the 2018 school survey parents trust the school and have been communicated with at least twice a 
week. At Luisa Dessus Cruz, parents are informed on pf their child's progress on a weekly basis and are provided 
progress reports every 4-6 weeks. Guidance counselors meets with students who are not passing their classes ever 
marking period. Conversations are held with parents, students, and teachers on the grades earned and the 
remediation and support students will receive to make up missing assignments.  

According to the 2018 learning environment survey, parents believe the school is a supportive environment, they feel 
the school is welcoming, and are informed about their children's grades and curriculum.  

Need: 

Parents need support and access on how to better support their children academic progress. We find that parents, 
while they have access to the Jupiter Grades information, access to contact teachers via email, telephone, or text, 
parents are challenged in supporting their child's academic progress. It has been determined through collaboration 
conversation with the SLT, parents, the guidance department, and with the teachers to support parents of those 
students who are considered the bottom 10% in their grade with attendance, performance, and/or with course 
grades. Each constituents propose the following: For each of the four marking periods, there will be an action plan 
and outreach provided to bottom 10% of the students who are not performing on grade level and/ or who have not 
earned a 70% on one of the major subjects.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be an average of 25 or more parents in every workshop offered and parent celebration at MS 
x302 as a result of consistent communication via phone, email, and backpack as measured by the sign-in sheets .

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Middle School 302X , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Middle School 302X will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

As a result of a needs assessment, we will create a supplemental instructional program that will 
thirty-eight (38) long term ELLs (4 through 7 years)  in grades 7 - 8 who are still performing at 
the Entrance, Emerging, Expanding, and Transitioning proficiency levels.  The data shows a 
decrease of 12 out of 66 long term ELLs in the 2016-2017 school year. We currently have  fifty 
four (54) long term ELLs (20 - 6th graders; 18 - 7th graders). We believe that providing our long 
term ELLS with a supplemental instructional program where they can be provided with 
additional opportunities of targeted, scaffolded, and modeled instruction, guided practice, and 
immediate feedback as they engage in activities that are inclusive of all four modalities, reading, 
writing, listening, and speaking will support them in demonstrating growth on the NYSESLAT 
and ELA exam. A supplemental after school program will take place every Wednesday starting 
November 14, 2018 until April 24, 2019 from 2:40 pm - 4:40 pm (a total of 21 sessions). 
Three(3) certified ENL teachers  will participate in the afterschool program. The ELA common 
branch teacher will co-teach for one hour with each ENL certified teacher. The instructional 
program used with our ELLs during our regular school day are based on their performance levels 
and language acquisition needs (Language Power, Levels A, B, and C) for newcomers and 
students at the Entering and Emerging Levels with less than two-years in the NYC Public School 
System. For Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding students we use the ELA curriculum 
with differentiated scaffolds and leveled texts based on their needs. We will use supplemental 
materials for the afterschool program will be "Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond" 
by Attanasio & Associates and "Test Ready" from Curriculum Associates. Both vendors are

other resources that they believe will support student achievement.

support  staff.                                
Topic 2: Analyzing ELL Data 
Rationale: To analyze the NYSESLAT simulation test that will be administered in November 
and the first unit task completed by English Language Learners for the first marking period to 
determine trends across the grades and areas in need of improvement. Findings will be used to 
target instruction in small groups based on student's areas in need of improvement. 
Date: December 3, 2019 
Time: 2:40 pm - 4:00 pm 
Name of Provider: Christine Reyes and Pamela Boulware 
Audience: 6th, 7t, and 8th  grade teachers and paraprofessionals 
Topic 3: What is the NYSESLAT? 
 Rationale: English Language Arts teachers will be introduced to the format of 
the NYSESLAT exam, how this assessment is used to measure the progress of English Language 
Learners, administration dates, testing accommodations, and how to support English Language 
Learners to ensure they demonstrate growth in the NYSESLAT exam. 
Date: February 4, 2019  
Time: 2:40 pm - 4:00 pm 
Name of Provider: Christine Reyes and Pamela Boulware 
Audience: 6th, 7th, and 8th  grade ELA teachersIn addition, during common planning all 
teachers (ELA, mathematics, science, social studies, and visual arts) while they develop their 
units of study and lesson plans have to discuss ways in which in which they will differentiate the 
instructional outcomes, scaffolds and activities, and assessments to meet the needs of our ELL 
population in the classroom. Targeted teachers  and the ENL teacher will attend three times a 
year to the professional development opportunities offered by the Office of English Language 
Learners. They will be responsible of sharing the information with their colleagues during grade 
meeting and/or department meeting.                                                       Two 
certified ESL teachers  will participate in a bi-weekly (every other Monday)  study group on the 
following dates: January 7, January 14, January 21, January 28, February 4, February 11, 
February 25, March 4, March 11, March 18,  March 25, April 1, April 8, April 15, April 29, May 
6, May 13, and May 20, 2019 from 2:40 pm - 4:00 pm. Two Peer Instructional Coaches will be 
responsible for the planning the study group sessions. Thinking routines like Socratic Seminars, 
Ink-Pair-Share, 4 A's (Agree, Assume, Argue, Aspire) among others that the facilitator considers 
appropriate will be utilized to delve deeper into each chapter in order to take away strategies to 
help our English Language Learners.                       
The facilitators will use thinking protocols to actively analyze and discuss the text in order to 
better ENL pedagogy to support English Language Learners in the classroom and provide them 
with ample opportunities to demonstrate achievement in all content areas. Attendance and sign-
in sheets will be kept on file.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At MS 302 we use data from the NYSESLAT and other standardized assessments administered in the Spring 2017 like the New 
York State English Language Arts assessment and New York State Mathematics Assessment. uses an array of assessment tools 
to assess the literacy skills and progress of our ELLs. The data obtained from the NYS ELA assessment, Word Generation, and I-
Ready are used  to plan accordingly and support our ELLs to ensure they show growth in the English language.  The data 
gathered from these assessment tools clearly indicate that our ELLs struggle with the reading and writing modality. Therefore, 
in order to support our ELLs with demonstrating growth in these two areas we focus on explicit modeling and small group 
instruction in which our ELLs are strategically targeted to help them improve in reading and writing.  
  
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All teachers meet by department four times a week and once a week as a grade to discuss, plan, and review the supports for 
English Language Learners in their classroom. In these meetings, they receive support from the ENL teacher, the assistant 
principals, and the Peer Instructional Coaches to ensure that ENL pedagogical strategies, materials and resources, and the 
activities are differentiated and scaffolded for the students to ensure they meet the instructional outcomes based on their 
language proficiency level.  
 
Every six weeks, at the end of each unit and after administering the end of the unit task, the teachers meet by department to 
analyze the data and identify areas of strength and weakness, and the supports that will be provided for the students to 
address the areas identified, and how it will addressed and assessed in the upcoming unit. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
A NYSESLAT simulation test is administered to the students three times (September, December, and March) a year to identify 
the area (NYSESLAT modality) in which the students will receive additional support to ensure they meet Target of 
Measurement (TOM) and demonstrate improvement, either by scale scores and/or performance levels, in the NYSESLAT. In 
addition, we use the the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to provide targeted instruction and support to our students. The data 
obtained from the aforementioned tools are used to observe the improvements ELLs are experiencing as well as the areas in 
which we need to focus.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

At MS 302, after the administration of the simulated NYSESLAT, we conduct a Data Drive/Item Analysis three times a year 
(September, December, and March). We identify the grade trends based on the data and teacher observations. Then, we 
develop and implement an action plan to address the areas of concerns. This action plan is shared with all other departments 
so that the students receive targeted instruction based on the data obtained. As indicated above, interim assessments are 
administered to monitor student progress. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
MS 302 uses the EDAT tool, NYSESLAT, and formative assessments to monitor student learning over time in order to make 
individualized educational decisions, and to assist them with RTI and AIS support services. Support services are based on the 
content area, English and home language literacy, number of years of ENL instruction, long-term ELL and SIFE status, and 
teacher recommendation. Student needs are identified in Tiers. Tier 1 students will receive increasingly intensive levels of 
support provided in Tiers 2 and 3. At-risk students, in Tier 1 and 2, are offered intensive small-group support in addition to 
their regular curriculum. ELL students who do not respond to intervention are given more intensive intervention through Tier 3 
by increasing the frequency and duration of the intervention. Students are being serviced daily by both the ENL teacher and 
the ELA teacher. During common planning, the teachers have an opportunity to consistently analyze samples of student work 
in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies to make the necessary adjustments to support student learning. 
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The analysis of the NYSITELL confirm that the newcomer students that arrive at MS 302 have limited skills in the English 
language. The analysis of the NYSESLAT reveals the following: 17 students advanced 1 proficiency level; 11 students advanced 
2 proficiency levels; 2 students advanced 3 proficiency levels; 0 students advanced 4 proficiency levels; and 44 students 
remained at the same proficiency level. 
  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) is shared with all teachers to differentiate instruction based on the language modality 
(reading, writing, listening, and speaking) need of improvement. Targeted instruction is delivered to identified students. The 
interim assessments are then used to determine growth or additional support. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Freestanding ENL services are provided through pull-out services for the students who have been identified, as per 
the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data, to be entitled of receiving ENL services.  English as a new language is provided by 
the ENL teacher through a stand alone pull-out model. The students are grouped together by grade. The schedule 
allows for 75% of the time to receive blocked ENL and 25% individual 45 minute period of instruction. Students at the 
entering and emerging levels of English language proficiency receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction; students at the 
transitional and expanding proficiency level receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of ELA 
instruction; and students at the commanding proficiency levels receive 90  minutes of ENL instruction. Then the 
students are grouped accordingly to ensure appropriated instructional differentiation, appropriate academic 
intervention services and other instructional support services. 
   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable 
  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable 
   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Freestanding ENL services are provided through pull-out services for the students who have been identified via the NYSESLAT 
as ELLs. Students are grouped via instructional minutes (homogeneous) and the type of services that are appropriate for 
students at each of the English language proficiency levels. The NYSESLAT is the primary data via which students English 
language proficiency levels are determined. To that end, students at the entering and emerging levels of English language 
proficiency receive, at a minimum, 360 minutes English language instruction and students at the transitional and expanding 
proficiency level receive at a minimum, 180 minutes of English language instruction and ELA instruction. Students at the 
commanding proficiency levels receive 90  minutes of English Language instruction. Once the proficiency levels have been 
ascertained, then the students are grouped accordingly to ensure appropriated instructional differentiation, appropriate 
academic intervention services and other instructional support services.  
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

All content area instruction is delivered in English. Unit objectives integrate academic language objectives and content 
objectives. Such academic language objectives include the study of language structures, Tier 2 academic vocabulary and Tier 3 
content area vocabulary. The facilitation of discussions is centered on the academic language objectives and further supported 
by questions stems based on Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Educational Objectives. ESL methodologies and strategies 
used for the delivery of instruction include, but are not limited to: explicit modeling, one-to-one support, small group 
instruction, academic and content area language charts, visual aids, Total Physical Response (TPR), manipulatives, technology, 
and graphic organizers to support the learning of language and content objectives; as well as the incorporation of activities 
that incorporate ELL students' life experiences and diverse cultures. The ESL program aligns instruction to the New York State 
Common Core Standards. The instructional language is English. Our school currently has one teacher with a ESOL, therefore, 
we have a stand alone pull out program.  
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  MS 302 does not have a transitional bilingual or dual language program; we have a free standing ENL program. Therefore, the 
language of instruction in all content areas is provided in English. However, newly identified Spanish speaking ELLs are 
administered the Spanish LAB with ten (10) days of being admitted into the school system to determine their language 
proficiency in their own language. For the administration of the NYS Mathematics and Science assessment a translated version 
of the test is provided to identified students. 
   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The supports provided for each sub group is the following: 
SIFE - A supportive environment that responds to immediate social, cultural, and linguistic needs of the student is provided. 
Also, student and parent access to support services provided by counselors, teachers, and parent coordinator is offered and 
provided to both. We implement a peer  support system in the classroom to get student integrated into the culture of the 
school. 
 
Newcomer - Teacher and coaches select culturally relevant classroom resources and provide opportunities for students to 
share their  culture. The teachers differentiate instruction that is designed to support individual students that are learning 
taking into account their varied needs. of the students. Additionally, ENL and content area teachers ensure that the students 
receive consistent and effective support in developing mastery of academic language they will need to learn to understand the 
content. 
 
Developing - ENL teacher and content area teachers create multiple opportunities throughout the lesson for oral language 
development to support students. Modified and leveled texts are purchased and provided to students to ensure they can 
participate in class activities. Interactive protocols, strategies, and routines are implemented to engage students in discourse 
allowing them the opportunity to converse with their peers at their own pace and practice the language. Think-pair share as a 
strategy to provide a safe place for students to practice their English with a proficient partner. Some instructional strategies 
teachers will used with these students are stating and restating instructions and directions, creating a low anxiety environment 
and explicit modeling oral 
reading for students to emulate. 
 
Long term ELLs - We have designed an after school program for long term ELLs to address academic gaps in their learning. 
During the day there will be lessons designed around carefully structured language objectives. There will be a focus on writing 
that includes academic vocabulary and oral language that supports students thinking and writing abilities. Differentiated 
instructional strategies along with explicit academic language and literacy development across content will be integrated into 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

the day program for these students, and in the after school program.  
 
Former ELLs - Students who scored proficient on the NYSESLAT continue to be supported in the classroom. They also receive 
90 minutes of ENL instruction as follows to support the ELA teacher to continue building background knowledge, provide 
explicit instruction and modeling to ensure students are aware of what they are learning and how they respond to what they 
are learning.  Finally, the ENL teacher removes scaffolds by using non-linguistic clues and attention to the rate of our speech 
(including wait time for questions asked), will further support students including teachers frequently checking for 
understanding throughout the lesson.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Instruction for ELLs identified as having special needs is just as rigorous as it is for ELLs who do not have special needs, 
however, additional scaffolding and differentiation is provided.  A full time or part time paraprofessional  has been placed in 
the classes to assist the special education students, as per their IEP. In order for all four aspects of language proficiency to be 
targeted, the four modalities-listening, speaking, reading and writing- are constantly developed. This is accomplished through 
the following: listening activities –audio and video, teacher talk, class discussions, reading and writing strategies, reading 
workshop, and writing workshop. The school has purchased Code-X and non-fiction novels. These materials are adapted by the 
ESL and content area teachers to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs. Guided groups and one-to-one instruction is used to support 
ELLs who are identified as SWDs. The content is modified to further support students access of the content in smaller pieces. 
Extended time is provided for SWDs when administering formative assessments. Teachers meet for common planning by 
content and department to discuss and plan collaboratively, analyze student work, and share strategies to better support 
individual needs of ELL-SWDs. 
     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Instruction for ELL SWDs reflects the school's overall philosophy for all students, differentiated instruction is provided for 
students needing additional curricular and/or instructional support.  Students with SWD are integrated in the general 
education, ICT, or self-contained classroom for instruction across the content. Paraprofessionals are utilized to  provide 
support to SWD during content classes to assist students in navigating the curriculum and lead smaller instructional groups 
within the classroom. SETSS students are supported by the SETSS teacher in a push-in or pull-out format based on the unit of 
study and what is agreed on by the instructioal team to best support the student.  In conjunction with the Special Education 
Department in our school, using the students' IEP's, SETTs providers, content area teachers  and ENL teachers set short term 
goals in order to achieve the student's IEP goals and attain English proficiency. Students are  grouped with general education 
students, taking into account their IEP group mandates.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other content areas are ongoing and consistent. They include: 
Guided reading, peer tutoring (buddy system), small goup instruction, differentiated instruction; individualized classroom 
assignments and projects, and after school homework help and tutoring. Some of the strategies used are the use of bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries, materials in NL for newcomers (new arrivals), extended time on exams, identifying and building on 
the background knowledge, identifying and teaching essential vocabulary, using a variety of visual aids, simplifying 
grammatical structures and paraphrasing, using sentence starters, collaborative discussion frames, among others. 
   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We continue to invest  in technology resources, ie, I-Ready, Ipads, Laptops, and Smartboards Guided Reading Libraries, Digital 
Library with access to 4,000 titles, and  MYON.  In addition, we have purchased novels in their native language that are aligned 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

to the curriculum.  
   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No program or services will be discontinued. 
   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs have equal access to all school programs in our school. Teachers ensure that ELLs are aware of available programs and 
services offered to all students. They participate in sports, homecoming, special school trips aimed at immersing ELLs into 
Amercian culture and developing language. ELLS are also active in after school programs including our 21st century program.    
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials used to support ELL instruction include  I-Ready, Digital Library, MYON, Ipads, and Laptops, guided 
reading libraries, and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond,  Language Power, and Spanish/English dictionaries and 
glossaries. MS 302 uses technoly in every classroom. Classrooms ae equipped with a minumum of 12 tablets or Ipads (self-
contained classroom) and 20 to 30 Ipads or tablets in the general education classrooms.  
   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All instruction is delivered in English. Native language support is given through the use of bi-lingual dictionaries and bilingual 
glossaries; teachers and peers that speak the native language, as well as the use of ESL strategies such as the use of visual aids 
and gestures.   
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Support services and resources correspond to student need and/or IEP according to their age and grade level. Tutoring services 
are aligned to grade level to support academic assessment needs.  These services match or exceed what is provided to general 
education students.  
    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
MS 302 houses a charter school, Girls Prep. Thus far, we have been able to fulfill all the needs of our students without having 
to share or coordinate resources with the charter school.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Small group instruction and additional classroom support either by a paraprofessional or City Year member is assigned to 
provide additional support for newly enrolled ELL students. English Now!, and A-Z Guided Reading are used instructional 
programs used with the newly enrolled ELL students. Activities and strategies for newly enrolled ELL students are guided 
reading, read alouds, the use of manipulatives, visuals, games,  displaying a print rich environment to support oral 
language,  modeling activities for students, use of read-alouds and think-alouds, , use of hands-on activities, use of bilingual 
students as peer helpers, adjustment of speech to enhance comprehension,  ask yes/no questions, ask students to 
show/point/draw, frontloading of vocabulary/terminilogy/cognates, among many others.   
 
Newcomes are welcomed and nurtured by the entire school family. Their native language is identified upon registration, so 
adults and children from the same language background within the school can provide linguistic support to those students. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

Such communication facilitates their transition to the school system. Throughout the school day, students who are newcomers 
receive ongoing academic and social support by our Administrative team, classroom teachers, ENL teacher, parent 
coordinator, guidance counselors, and SETTS provider and buddy peer tutoring. The ENL teacher, instructional coaches, and 
assistant principals share with content area teachers strategies to support gradual student progress from one linguistic stage 
to the next. Students are integrated in classrooms, small group, push-in/pull-out instruction, and on-going sustained 
individualized instruction. Buddy/ peer tutors work in concert with teachers, and assist newcomers in learning the basic 
survival skills, class routines and class assignment whenever possible. Provisions are made for all newcomers to participate in 
before, after-school and Saturday programs and activities offered in the school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The language in which electives are offered to ELLs is English. No other language is offered. 
   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At MS 302 professional development is ongoing. All the teachers participate in the ELL professional development because all 
of them teach classes that include ELL students. The topics for discussion during staff meetings, department meetings, and 
professional development days are focused around ESL pedagogy, second language acquisition, best practices for subject area 
teaching, incorporating the core curriculum and technology in the classroom, and different types of scaffolds to promote 
learning (procedural scaffolding, instructional scaffoling, and verbal scaffolding). In addition, the teaching staff attends 
workshops provided by the CFN and the Office of English Language Learners. Subject area and ESL teachers attend daily 
common planning meetings and grade  
meetings where they discuss student progress, teaching strategies and other pertinent matters. Professional development 
includes Academic Development Language and Extended Writing for Grades 6 - 8, Identifying and Working with ELLs with 
Learning Differences and Disabilities, ENL strategies: small group instruction, differentiation of resources and scaffolds, among 
others. 
 
To support teachers of ELL students in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards, the ESL 
teacher, subject area teacher, and lead teacher are afforded the opportunity to meet and plan on a daily basis. During these 
planning sessions teachers discuss how to align ESL strategies into the curriculum to support the needs of the students. These 
sessions are also used to reflect on what worked, what did not worked, and next steps for future lessons. 
  
Ongoing professional development on language acquisition, ESL pedagogy, and scaffolding techniques will be afforded 
to teachers during and after school. In addition, ESL teachers will attend workshops  provided by the Office of English 
Language Learners.  Other teachers are encouraged to attend.   
   
All teachers receive ongoing professional development on language acquisition and strategies the work with English Language 
Learners. We conduct bi-weekly study groups on ENL strategies, learning, and achievement. A peer instructional coach for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

literacy, math, and science are part of daily common planning and department meetings to share strategies and scaffolds to 
support ELLs.  
 
Para-professionals are a participate in all the professional development provided to the teachers as well as study groups so 
that they have the background knowledge to better support ELLs. Agendas and sign-in sheets are kept in a binder in the 
assistant principal's office. Copies of these agendas and sign-in sheets are also provided to the principal's secretary. 
 
Professional development agendas are distributed to all participants who in turn are required to sign in. Agendas and sign-in 
sheets are kept in binder in the principal's office. 
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
At MS 302, the staff and administrative team receive ELL training through on-sight and off-sight professional   
development that specifically addresses the needs of our English language learners. Best approaches and teaching practices 
that should be implemented to meet the learning needs of all ELLS are shared with teachers. Training on how to develop 
listening, speaking as well as reading and writing skills of ELLs is provided. During the training sessions, opportunities are 
provided for teachers to ask questions about specific concerns. For the ENL teacher, a minimum of 50% of the required 
professional development hours will be geared to language acquisition. We will focus on the best practices for co-teaching that 
focus on strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Records are maintained by keeping agendas and 
attendance records of all staff who attended are kept in a binder.  PD topics include: Stages of Language Acquisition; Tiered vs. 
Differentiated Instruction; Classroom Strategies that Work with ELLs; Scaffolds and Modified/Leveled Texts, among others. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Annual meetings with ENL parents are held to discuss and provide the parents with information regarding the school’s 
expectations and their role as parents in support to the school’s effort to provide a quality education to its students as well as 
their child’s academic progress. ENL teacher, with the assistant principal and the parent coordinator schedule one-to-one 
meetings with parents to discuss their child's academics, language development, attendance, and other after school supports 
to help their child achieve academic success. In addition, parents are invited to attend meetings with teachers, preferable on 
Tuesday afternoons during parent engagement or any other day that is convenient to them so that the ENL teacher and 
regular teacher meet with parents to discuss language development process, language proficiency results and discuss ways 
that the parents can help their children. If parents are not available, phone calls are made and the meeting is held. Interpreters 
will be available to assist with translation and interpretation for parents who do not speak English as a primary language. 
School staff translation lists allow us for easy access to find the correct interpreter for translation needs. Currently, our school 
has staff members who are fluent en Spanish and French for parents who need translation support. Informational materials 
are sent home or given to parents in their native language to facilitate their understanding of the school’s expectations. 
Specialized training, skilled teaching and mastery of the English Language of ELL students, and parental involvement is utilized 
to promote academic achievement, while meeting the city and state common core standards in reading and math, as well as in 
other content areas.   
 
Agendas and sign in sheets are kept in a binder in the assistant principal's office. 
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

Workshops are held for all parents in all different areas to keep the communication going between the parents and their 
child’s education. Workshops on Jupiter Grades, I-Ready, and Data allow parents to understand how they can access student 
information whenever necessary. Public Interest workshops held, provide parents important information about their child’s 
well being.  New this year we created an  ESL Café which will be help four times a year to share with parents how they can help 
their children at home, available resources in out outside the school community, and answer any concerns or questions they 
may have. This year we are also providing ENL classes for the parents of ELLs.  
 
The parent coordinator will keep and maintain a record with agendas and sign in sheets that will be stored in the main office in 
a locked cabinet file.. Interpreters will be available to assist with translation and interpretation for parents who do not speak 
English as a primary language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Liza Ortiz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and 
staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At Luisa Dessus Cruz we use the Home Language Survey (HLIS) data completed by the parents at the time of 
enrollment to determine the language in which the parent prefers to be in communication with the school as well 
as the face-to-face interview conducted with the parents at the time of enrollment. In addition, we use data from 
the BESIS report which highlights the home language of each English Language Learner. Information on the BESIS 
report derives from the parent's completion of the Home Language Survey. We also refer to the Student 
Emergency Contact card (Blue Card) in which parents indicate the language in which they would like to recieve 
information and communicate with the school. 

All written communications are posted, mailed, and distributed in both English and Spanish. Key members of our 
school staff such as the principal, assistant principal, parent coordinator, guidance counselors, social workers, and

school physcologist are bilingual and available to translate in order to communicate the needs and concerns of 
our parents. For those parents who might require additional translation services and to ensure they are involved 
in their child's education, we use the services provided by the Translation and Interpretation Unit to ensure that 
the lines of communication remain open between parents/guardians and pedagogical staff. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,

support them to ensure there is an open line of communication between parents and teachers. Non bilingual teachers 
who need to schedule a meeting with parents must inform the assistant principals, parent coordinator, and guidance 
counselors to support with translation during the meeting. If the parent speaks a language for which we do not have a 
translator on site, we will use the services of the Translation and interpretation Unit to assist the parent in 
communicating with the school personnel. In this case, the teachers are required to inform the translating staff 
members in the school at least a week in advance so that we can request the translating and interpretations services 
of the Translation and Interpretation Unit. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any:
