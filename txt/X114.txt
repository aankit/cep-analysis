Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

To establish a safe child-centered learning community designed to meet each child’s academic, social, emotional, and 
psycho motor needs. Our commitment is to continuously provide quality instruction so that there is measurable 
achievement of the academic and attendance performance of all students.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Luis Llorens Torres Elementary School (PS 114X) is situated at 1155 Cromwell Avenue, Bronx in New York City. It has 
802 students from kindergarten through grade five. The school population comprises 23.63% Black, 69.36% Hispanic, 
3% Asian and 4.39% other students. The student body includes 30.64% English language Learners and 17.22% Student 
with Disabilities (SWD). Boys account for 53.21% of the students enrolled and girls account for 46.79%. The average 
attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 92%. PS 114X has a collaborative program with a community 
based organization , Supportive Children Advocacy Network of New York (SCANNY). The organization is self-funded 
and provides services to the children in both academic and recreational activities five days weekly - Monday through 
Friday, from 2:30 to 5:30 pm. In practice, the children participate in the school’s After School program on Wednesday 
and Thursday from 2:30 to 5:30 pm beginning in October 2018 and ending in June 2019. During the other days, the 
students engage in completing homework for 45 minutes and participate in joint gym activities with the school’s After 
School sports program. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Students with Disabilities (SWD) and English Language Learners (ELL) will be provided with Response to 
Intervention (RTI) and/or the Continuous Problem Solving Model (CPSM) services. RTI uses tiers of instructional 
intervention for struggling students, relies on a strong core curriculum and instruction prior to intervening with 
individual students, incorporates problem solving to determine interventions for students, requires regular 
monitoring of students who have academic and behavioral difficulties. The RTI model is delivered in three tiers - tiers 
I, II, and III. At tier I, general education teachers provide instruction within the core curriculum to all students in the 
school. Differentiation of instruction including language support is included in Tier I. A system of progress monitoring 
is applied. It entails measuring how students are doing in response to the general content core curriculum with 
particular attention to the students identified as at-risk or coming in as SWD. Tier II is generally the point where 
focused small group assistance begins, based on the some emerging need identified through the progress monitoring 
done during Tier I instruction and intervention. Reading specialists, English as a Second Language (ESL) instructors, 
and other content area assistance will be provided either in Integrated or Stand Alone settings. Additionally, students 
in the bilingual transitional or English Language Learners (ELL) are served at this level.  

In the CPSM a circular movement of student and the intervention process is followed. That is, (1) Problem 
Identification - Is there a discrepancy between current and expected performance?; Measurement of the Problem - 
Why and to what extent is there a problem; Goal Setting - By how much should the student grow? ; Possible 
Intervention Approaches - What may be done to resolve the problem?; Implementation of Intervention - How and 
when will the intervention strategy be implemented? ; Monitoring of Intervention - By how much should student 
improved?; Analysis of Response - Did it work?; and Evaluation of Intervention - Is there a need to continue or revisit 
approach? This approach is applicable to al sub groups which include ELL, SWD, Students in Temporary Housing (STH),

During the 2016-17 academic year the school has, as measured by The Six Elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools: 

1. Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High 
standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing 
critical thinking skills. Independently and collectively, significantly increased collaboration in identifying the school’s 
major priorities; achieved better engagement of the faculty in developing and implementing the strategies for 
addressing the identified school improvement priorities: established effective goals for groups of students, 
classrooms, grades and subjects through more effective use of data.; established data tracking systems for reading 
that demonstrates growth against agreed benchmarks; created target student groups for the specific categories 
where the school is not meeting Annual Yearly Progress (AYP); and provided intensive support strategies to help those 
students achieve a higher level in the State test in ELA. The administration will collaborate with the teachers to 
develop an acceptable-coordinated common planning of curriculum, instruction, and assessment in corporation with 
personnel from the Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) and the District 09 Education Office. In the 2016-17 School 
Quality Snapshot survey report showed a good rating (80%) that is to say teachers and parents combined, responded 
positively that curriculum and instruction are designed to engage students, foster critical thinking skills, and are 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. 

 

2. Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, 
supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. Measurable steps will be taken to build on the success of the 
school's culture for the 2017-18 school year. The survey rating was poor (78%). The school will make this a focus in 
the year 2017-18 to establish a culture where students feel safe, challenged to grow, and supported to meet high 
expectations. 

 

3. Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. The concentration will be on selecting, planning around, implementing, and using data from formative 
and summative assessments to drive student learning. As such, the school’s Instruction Focus is for all students to 
increase their performance on the New York State Tests in Math and ELA 2018 through the use of assessment data by 
way of teacher to teacher conversations; classroom inter visitations; teacher team deliberations, analysis of student 
work, rubric development, application of decided teaching strategy, follow up evaluation, and administrative, walk 
through, informal and informal observations, and feedback. The school received a good rating (86%) indicating that 
teachers participated in opportunities to develop, grow, and contribute to the continuous improvement of the school 
community. 

 

4. .Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 

The school implements standard based curricula, with attention to informational reading and writing across the 
grades and content areas. The projected end result being higher student achievement; and (d) grade level teams meet 
weekly to modify curricula to increase access for all students. In addition, the specific Professional Improvement Plan 
(PIP) for administrative and teacher practices include on-going professional development; consistent observation and 
feedback to teaching staff; modification and /or adjustment of the curriculum; strategic use of resources; 
reprogramming of staff schedules; expansion / redirection of teacher teams; a collaborative community team that 
meets regularly to review and refine the school’s goals. In teaching and learning, the administration distributes both

human and financial resources that serve all students; foster instructional practice and a curriculum, aligned with the 
Danielson’s framework and the CCLS respectively; time to implement and coordinate the new demands of MOSL, 
MOTP, CCLS. Survey results revealed that the school had a good rating (86%) indicating that the school leadership 
inspires the school community with a clear instructional vision and effectively endeavours to build capacity to realize 
its vision.  

 

5. .Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
The principal, the curriculum team and the School Leadership Team (SLT) will work diligently and strategically to 
create a learning environment that fosters a higher level of student achievement and parent involvement. A rating 
(89%) shows that the school forms effective partnerships with families and outside organizations to steadfastly 
improve.  

 

6. Trust: Everyone l worked and will continue to work toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, 
preparing students for success in school and beyond. Across the school community, There is respect: School staff, 
parents, students and administrators value each other. Monthly staff meetings, newsletters, grade and subject area 
meetings; and implement weekly Individual Administrator/ Teacher Conversations (IATC) to ascertain 
accomplishments, shortcomings, and next steps. The rating of 90% testifies that the relationships between 
administrators, educators, students and families are based on trust and respect.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Our Highly qualified teacher hiring process begins with a staff needs assessment. Staff deficits are often caused by 
attrition. A profile of the new teacher is developed based on State requirements for hiring new teachers, Areas of 
academic intervention, and student population learning needs. Selected teachers are then invited to attend teachers 
hiring venues throughout the city. Pre-selected teachers who meet our school selection criteria are invited to do a 
presentation of their teaching skills at our school. These presentations involve teachers, students, and interested staff 
members. After their presentation, those who participated in these presentations debrief and share their 
observations. A consensus is often reached and the retained candidates are invited to a more formal interview. After 
the first interview, selected candidates are required to share their portfolios with a selected group of staff members. 
Finally, the candidates who are selected are invited to a final interview process following the norms established by the 
DOE . In addition, teachers are recruited based on leadership qualities, morale, "Thank you!" letters, and 
certifications. 

In an effort to ensure teachers maintain a status or work toward attaining a status of "highly qualified", teachers are 
encouraged to seek regular opportunities for continued professional development; actively invite colleagues to 
observe and critically analyse delivery of lessons; attend or join professional education organizations and share 
learning experiences with peers and supervisors while implementing some of the strategies in their individual 
classrooms.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our high quality professional development for teachers, principals, and paraprofessionals begins with the professional 
development goal setting process involving all school stakeholders. Such process takes into consideration the 
Framework for Excellence, school-wide focus, staff members’ evaluations, and the school goals. The purpose is to 
seek and obtain alignment between the school goals and those formulated by each school stakeholder. The outcome 
of all professional development strategies and activities in our school is to enable school stakeholders to acquire the 
knowledge and skills needed to help all school learners succeed in meeting our State Common Core Standards. The 
principal and school leaders will attend monthly professional development hosted by the District Superintendent.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information, 
early intervention services, etc.). 
Preschoolers and their parents receive several orientation sessions with the Guidance counselors and the K-2 
Assistant Principal . Once on site, they are given a tour of the building including visits to active Kindergarten 
classrooms by staff members. Our Early Childhood curriculum is aligned o the NYS Common Core Standards. Parents 
and community members receive information about the school, its programs, and how they can get involved in 
helping their children succeed. Since most of our preschoolers have never attended school, educational records are 
minimal or non -existent. Every step is taken to ensure that the preschoolers, during the transition period, get all the 
support that they need for a successful entry. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Common Assessments have been created in Math and ELA to create a clear picture of student progress, monitor 
progress, and adjust curricular and instructional decisions: 

● Teachers across grades use Teacher College Reading and Writing Program rubrics to assess students in the aligned 
unit of study.  

● -Teachers in grades 3-5 use TC continua and student checklists to make instructional adjustments and decisions, as 
well as to Help students create individual writing goals  

● Grades 3-5 Math Coach, Literacy Coach, Data Coach, and Lead Teachers work collaboratively to develop CCLS 
aligned math assessments

● K-2 Math Coach, Literacy Coach, Data Coach, and Lead Teachers work collaboratively with the classroom and cluster 
teachers, Teacher Teams, and RTI providers to align performance tasks and progression level assessments to CCLS and 
instructional priorities 

● Data Coach provides data analysis of school-wide assessment in ELA and math. 

● Teachers use small group planning template, based on data of specific instructional needs, to effectively create and 
monitor student goals 

● School Leaders developed and implemented assessment calendar scheduling grade and individual data 
conversations approximately every 6-8 weeks 

Teachers, vertically and horizontally, in Grade Teacher Team Meeting (GTTM), participate in grade trend discussions 
based on student work assessments (formative and summative) leading to consistent collaborative monitoring of 
student learning.  

● Teachers in all grades meet to discuss student trends in CCLS-aligned performance tasks and reading and writing 
progression levels(initial and post tasks) 

● Teachers meet weekly in Grade Teams to discuss trends in student learning based on math, reading and writing 
assessments  

● School-wide data conversations to discuss trends in student learning vertically and horizontally 

● During October 2018 GTTM a digital progress-monitoring system as it relates to Danielson Framework for Teacher 
Effectiveness and Evaluation  

● Students develop rubrics for assessment and use to engage in scoring work products by peers. 

They exchange work inter/intra-groups and give immediate feedback noting one strength and one recommendation. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 114X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Luis Llorens Torres Children's Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated

Begin description here:            
  There are 139 immigrant students in grades 3 - 5 combined. This constitutes 31.7% of the entire 
student population. Of greater significance, these students are English Language Learners (ELL) 
- Title III LEP _  and Former ELL. The English Language Learners in grades 3-5 performance 
Levels on the NYSESLAT 2018 showed that only 26% were proficient, while 69% showed no 
growth. As such, the  school has set a goal to increase their performances at the proficient 
Level.   
Classroom instruction will be designed to engage students in critical thinking that leads to 
higher-level comprehension. Our adopted comprehension strategy instruction will be to teach 
students how to construct meaning from text. Teachers will encourage both active participation 
and sustained effort of English Language Learners (ELL) - Title III LEP - during the reading 
process. Teachers will use six essential reading strategies: monitor and clarify, making 
connections, visualizing, asking questions, inferring and predicting, and summarizing to enable 
ELL- Title III Immigrants- to become active readers and learners. They will use transparencies to 
model each strategy; guide practice with interactive student cards, and apply learning with 
engaging and leveled texts. Teachers will help accelerate reading comprehension among ELL- 
Title III LEP- with interactive practice cards that promote paired, hands-on interaction and  the 
use of oral language. Teachers will provide students with daily articles, themed stories and 
current events stories for reading, appreciation, and discussion. These selected articles and 
stories will precisely be tailored to each student's reading level. All students in the class will read 
about the same subject, but the passages will be adjusted for their individual learning profiles. 
The contents of the selected materials will be aligned to the CCLS. The intent is to allow 
teachers to administer prescriptive assignments and help their students perform at the proficient 
level. 
The instruction reading strategies will be implemented as follows: 
I Introduction 
A). Pre-reading strategies to increase comprehension 
         - Do motivating activities 
          - Build text-specific knowledge 
          - Relate to students' lives 
          - Pre-teach vocabulary 
           - Pre-teach concepts 
            - Predicting and direction setting 
            - Suggest comprehension strategies 
B. Additionally, students will engage in activities such as looking at a video or film about a 
related topic; conducting an experiment, going on a field trip, bringing in materials or related 
objects to "show and tell'.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
II. Reading comprehension strategies for content learning.  
Examples of comprehension skills that will be taught in all reading situations include 
summarizing; Sequencing; Inference; Comparing and contrasting; Drawing conclusions; Self-
questioning; Problem-solving; Relating background knowledge; Distinguishing between fact and 
opinion; and finding main idea, important facts, and supporting details. Generally and more in 
line with CCLS, these skills are informational reading or expository reading.  
Instructional topic areas include the importance of reading comprehension skills; steps for 
explicitly teaching comprehension skills; identifying vocabulary words; modeling think-A-Loud; 
fix-up strategies; partnering ELL with more dominant English speakers; independent practice by 
ELL to explain terms and model each; using informational and expository tools such as titles, 
headings, bold print, captions, side bars, maps, graphs, pictures and bullets; summarizing orally 
or in writing to retell what was read, by including only important details coupled with key words 
from the text; answering question at the literal, interpretive and applied levels; and  celebrate 
each individual progress with recognition notes, praise, and/or class applause. 
Subgroup serviced: The low performing 69% grades 3-5 ELL will be serviced by this grant.  
Schedule and Duration:  After School program on Wednesday and Thursday from November 9, 
2017 to June  07, 2018 from 2:30  to 5:30 PM.

  Rationale: To ensure teacher effectiveness in engaging students in learning and so increase their 
performance on the NYS ELA Test and in the Speaking and Writing modalities on NYSESLAT 
2018, respectively, by 1 proficiency level and one modality respectively. 
 Teachers to Receive Training: three highly qualified Bilingual / ESL teachers - Ms. Villa  (5th), 
Ms. perez (4th), and Ms. Bethea (3rd) - will participate in the professional development 
activities. The data on student performance will be the base for professional development. 
Teachers will use the Internet to access information on STARS about each student under their 
individual instruction. They will collectively sit and analyze the results. The purpose is to design 
a strategic approach to address the students’ Language deficiency in the Speaking and Writing 
modalities. This will take place on December 13, 2018 from 3:40pm to 5:40 pm.  Teachers will 
review daily progress as it relates to the use of data to drive their instruction.  
Schedule and Duration:  They will work with one provider from the publisher for 1 hour from 
3:40- 4:40 p.m. on alternate Tuesdays between December 20, 2018 to May 2, 2019. That is

  Given the needed life-skills parents will develop the ability to function avidly in the socio-
economic realm of their society. 
 
Schedule and Duration: The sessions will be for 2 hours from 9:00 to 11:00 a.m. on Saturdays 
between 
January 14, 2019 to May 5, 2019. 
Topics to be covered: 1.Using technology to access the Internet to complete job application; visit 
DOE Parent Resource websites; and accessing, downloading, and completing necessary life-
skills clinical forms; and  (2) In-house English Language classes. This program will address the 
following barrier to parental involvement: lack of English Language Proficiency. A bilingual 
newsletter, and scheduled forth nightly meetings at local community centers to discuss school 
related issues.will be pursued and most likely implemented. Interpreters will be available at 
meetings and events. At the end of the program, parents will be able to identify all the resources 
needed to build a stronger community and have better self-actualization through their mastery 
and application of life-skills. 
Notification: Parents will be invited to participate by way of letter written in English and 
Spanish. The letter will be sent out 1 week in advance; and a timely reminder on Wednesday of 
the actual week date. 10% of the funds allocated for the program will be used to off set expenses 
for snacks and possible trips to places of interest as they relate to students' instruction.  The 
parents exposure to educational trips will give them a hands-on experience as they recount their 
experiences in reports, written and verbal.  The PD will take place on the third Saturday on 
the  following dates:  February 18, 2019; and March 18, 2019; and April 29,2019 from 9:am to 
!2:noon..The in-house PD sessions will be conducted by the Assistant principal and one teacher, 
Ms, Bethea. They will be compensated at the DOE per session rate of pay. Public transportation 
services for possible trips will be used at the regular fair rate of cost. Funding will be provided 
through the Title III allocation.  
All records  - agendas, attendance sheets,and invitations in parents' preferred languages - will be 
kept in a separate binder in the Assistant Principal's office.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 114 X  will use Teachers College Reading and Writing Program (TCRWP)  for all grades: K-5 in the Academic Years 2017-18 
and 2018-19. Assessment is administered annually. Group activities are designed for each grade and adapted to the time of 
year. Individual activities allow each child to be assessed at as many progressively higher levels as he or she can master.The 
following assessments are used for our ELL students : TCRWP,  NYISTELL, NYSESLAT, NY Periodic Assessment, Home 
Language Arts (HLA), Spanish. Performance Task which pairs the assessed students in Spanish Language Arts Instruction ( New 
this year).  These assessments will help the school to better identify students who need support in Spanish Language Arts. It is

hoped that this may enhance the bilingual program. Data to guide instructional planning will be posted as soon an 
analyzing  process is complete. (i.e., by 10/31/2017) 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students are are given NYSITELL, TCRWP (that includes a four point writing rubric with on demand units to assess proficiency) 
and HLA Spanish Performance Assessment to determine their reading levels. They are assessed individually by their respective 
classroom teacher during the school year. Between May and June the teachers in each grade switch to assess each other's 
students. Students are tested on a one-on-one basis to determine progress in reading levels.Math: End of Unit Assessments 
are used for each grade. Some students are allowed to do the assessment in Spanish. .  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The teachers in collaboration with the designated NY State Consultant/Liaison analyse the data and formulate instructional 
strategies to engage students in learning activities with the goal to move them one level upward. After deciding on a particular 
teaching method, the teachers implement and the review samples of student product to determine the next step in 
instructional practice. In short, they engage in a process of planning, implementing, and evaluating for improving instruction. 
Instructional coherence is the desired end result which wil be determined by ESSA (soon to implemented). A more 
formidable spread sheet to include baseline/benchmark assessment will be posted as soon as teachers complete rating and 
hold grade team discussion (i.e. 10/06/2017) 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The evidence shows that the students are struggling to get out of the performance level areas. In most instances their raw 
score performances constantly fall short by an insignificant .01 point. ELL whose home language is Spanish perform 
significantly higher in Math, which is in Spanish, than in the English Language Arts. 
The school leadership and teachers use the results from summative assessments to provide students with feedback on their 
performance to give opportunity for them to understand where they need to improve academically in both reading and 
writing.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
A multi-tiered model of service is used; delivery facilitates differentiated instruction and early intervention services for 
struggling learners. Movement between tiers is guided by a data-driven decision-making process. The basis for instructional 
decision is universal screening and progress monitoring.  Each of the three tiers will include both academic and behavioral 
interventions. When  a student's performance data indicate that the core instructional program is not effective in supporting 
that student in reaching the schools desired levels of success, early intervention strategies are implemented in an effort to 
prevent the need for longer term and more intensive interventions   Teachers engage in conversations to design and select 
strategies to improve student learning and behavior. 
   Although all the students are from homes where someone spoke a language other than English, not all are proficient in the 
home language;  some are proficient in English, and most are proficient in the home language and not proficient in English. As 
such, an integrated bilingual instructional approach is practiced in five classrooms (i.e. ESL , in the content areas with guided 
assistance in the home language every day with home-language literacy activities twice a week). An example of a RTI<, Tier 1 
approach  is shown below:  
 
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data pattern shows that the students are stagnant in their performance on the areas of assessment: Reading, Listening, 
Speaking and Writing on the NYSESLAT.  The shortcoming is across grades K - 5.. Data specialist i process of 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

 

compilig information. Should be ready for posting by 9/26/17. 
   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Applying the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), teachers will  have  professional development training in using the model; they will 
collaborate in grade team meetings vertically and horizontally. During Teacher Team meetings they will  review work product 
of students from identified classes and decide on one common instructional approach in teaching the particular concept. In 
addition, they will design a grading rubric to apply for evaluation of students' product. This pattern of meeting is set for a six 
week cycle for progress monitoring.  
     

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school has adopted the the Late-Exit Transitional/ Developmental or Maintenance model. Our main goal is to 
develop academic proficiency in English . As a transitional program, emphasis is placed on developing students’ first 
language and more emphasis on the first language as a bridge to English language development. The adopted 
developmental programs place equal emphasis on developing and maintaining students’ primary language and 
English  language proficiency. Our instructional program choice is based on the fact that 90 percent of of our ELL 
students are from  the same language background. The curriculum team believes that our ELL students  need a 
significant amount of instruction in native language while continuing to increase instruction in English (4-6 years). 
Furthermore, there are sizable groups of ELLs who speak the same language and are in the same grade. The school 
has five Bilingual teachers available to teach in the lower elementary grades. The teachers are proficient in using both 
languages for academic instruction. They are highly skilled in developing literacy in the primary language as 
foundation for English reading. ELA and Math assessments results inform the instructional organizational models. 
Integrated (Co-Teaching) or Stand Alone instructional approaches are used at different grade levels to help meet the 
learning needs of the ELL population. Heterogeneous classroom arrangements is the school's preferred model of 
instruction. 
   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

In our Transitional bilingual instructional program  all subjects are taught through two languages--English and Spanish. 
English is taught as a second language. English language skills, grade promotion and graduation requirements are 
emphasized and the native language (Spanish) is used as a tool to learn content. The primary goal of our instructional 
program is to facilitate the ELL students' transition to an all-English instructional environment while receiving 
academic subject instruction in the native language (Spanish) as needed. As proficiency in English increases, 
instruction through the native language decreases.     
         Bilingual teachers use the Transitional Bilingual Education Model for instruction.  Classes are formed according to 
the students' performance levels and follow one of these  models: classrooms with beginners used 60 
(Spanish):40(English); intermediate students used 50 (Spanish):50(English) model; and classrooms with advanced 
students use the 25 (Spanish):75 (English) model. In the 60:40 model. Balanced literacy and mathematics are taught in 
Spanish. However, balanced mathematics is taught predominantly in Spanish. English as a Second Language is taught 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

 

daily because of the urgent communication needs of certain ELL students. Science and Social Studies are taught three 
times a week in Spanish and twice in English or vice a versa.  In the 50:50 model,  balanced literacy is taught in 
Spanish. However,balanced mathematics are taught three times in Spanish and twice in English. English as a Second 
Language is taught four times a week for ninety minutes while Science/Social Studies classes are offered thrice in 
Spanish and twice in English or vice a versa. Again, instructional sessions are always accompanied by short summaries 
of the reading materials in the students’ native language. This approach allows teachers to assess and support 
students in their efforts to acquire knowledge of the content being taught. In the 25:75 model,  Native Language Arts 
is taught in Spanish; English Language Arts  is taught in English; Balanced Mathematics in English; English as a Second 
Language four times a week for forty-minutes; Science and Social Studies in English for forty-minutes alternating two 
or three times a week with additional preparation periods in English. In the subject areas where English is dominant, 
the instruction is scaffold. Teachers give short summaries in the students’ native language, if needed. Again, this is 
used by the teachers to assess and elevate students’ content knowledge.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

ENL students are instructed by the ENL teacher assigned to the school in a pull-out or scheduled class,according to their grade 
level. Students are grouped for ENL classes by English language proficiency levels within a 1-2 grade span. Placement in a level 
within the program is flexible and is re-evaluated annually or upon teacher request given the progress of the 
student.Additional instruction is provided through After-School programs. Students are eligible for Vacation Academies (i.e 
Winter, Mi-winter & Spring) for which they qualify. In addition, support services such as guidance and health  are available to 
all ENL students. Our class schedule is designed to allow staff members, who serve our ELL population, to provide the 
mandated number of instructional minutes to students according to their proficiency levels in English. Under CR Part 154-2, 
Entering/Emerging,Transitional and Expanding students receive  a minimum of 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  
                                    Entering/Emerging                               Transitional                                 Expanding

Based on New York State (NYS) regulations including CR Part 154-2. 
     The students receive ENL, ELA, and NLA instruction at various proficiency levels. The following guidelines have been applied 
in our school: (1) Students with 1.0 Entering or Emerging  or 2.0 Transitional English, ENL and NLA Standalone instruction daily 
(45 to 90minutes); (2)  Students with 3.0 Expanding English proficiency receive ESL or NLA Standalone instruction 2-3 times per 
week (no more than 45-minutes); (3) Students with 4.0 Commanding Level of English proficiency receive ENL or NLA 
Standalone instruction 1-2 times per week (no more than 90-minutes). However, students who are approaching fluency status

and are at grade level proficiency may be serviced on a consultative basis. ENL students at high levels of English proficiency 
and performing on or above grade level do not receive scheduled ENL instruction, but may receive short term instructional 
support if needed. The ENL teacher maintains formalized contact with content area teachers to ensure appropriate academic 
grade level performance,instructional modifications, and state wide testing accommodations. Students in the ENL program are 
continually assessed for their English language proficiency. Assignments to a level of instruction are not permanent.   However, 
students who are approaching fluency status and are at grade level proficiency may be serviced on a consultative basis. ENL 
students at high levels of English proficiency....  
    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Language instruction for ENL students in our system is delivered through “Content-based ENL Instruction. English 
Language skills and academic content are taught simultaneously.  In our English as a Second language (ESL) program,  English is 
the language of instruction. This model of instruction can accommodate students from different language backgrounds in the 
same class. ENL teachers do not need to know the language(s) of the students they teach. However, ENL teachers must be 
qualified and trained in techniques for teaching ENL students and must be knowledgeable of the varied cultures represented 
by their students. In addition, native language support is provided when necessary (bilingual dictionaries, textbooks in native 
languages, etc.)    
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students are grouped for instruction according to their levels of English language proficiency and their academic grade level. 
Students are not segregated from their English-speaking peers, except as necessary to implement the ENL program.The focus 
of instruction is the integration of teaching/learning academic content and English language skills. The goal of the program is 
to enable ENL students to achieve fluent language proficiency and grade level academic competency. In practice, the ENL 
teacher collaborates with  the ENL students' classroom teacher to design lesson plans for co-teaching during the integrated 
sessions. They also meet to discuss student's progress or deficiencies; and create a strategic remedy plan for the designated 
students. These approaches are incorporated into the Stand Alone periods to further help the students. 
     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

An overall description of how instruction is differentiated for ELL subgroups: Main stream and bilingual teachers differentiate  
instruction based on ELL proficiency levels to ensure that they master, in the shortest period of time, the English Language;  
strengthen their understanding of the language based on  the core curriculum. To do so, teacher develop an English learner 
profile.  
According to Bilingual Education research, the first step to differentiated instruction for English Language Learners is knowing 
the  
learners and determining their needs through an English Language Learner profile. Knowing the specific experiences and 
 knowledge each child brings to school empowers teachers to modify the process, content, or product according to  ELL  
students' needs. Consequently, instruction will consider each student's English proficiency level; Primary language proficiency 
 level; Schooling background; Preparation for learning; Interaction with the Text; Extended Learning capability. 
Each part of the lesson design must entail carefully selected, scaffold activities or tasks based on their students’ proficiency 
 levels and mastery of the subject matter.

(a) Instruction for Student with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) 
Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are either placed in a monolingual class setting with ESL services or in a 
Bilingual  
transitional class. To meet the needs of these students, we provide push-in and/or pull-out small group instruction during 
whole – 
group instruction time within the academic day. The Family Support Outreach Team works with the families of these children 
to  
eliminate or reduce the interruption of schooling.We are currently providing our newcomers with a push-in and pull-out 
model  
during whole-group instruction time to meet their learning needs and improve their academic achievement.The students 
received  
differentiated instruction at a modified level.  The pull-out model is applied to foster the ELL students' academic growth 
through a 
 variety of lessons that meet their specific needs.  
  
(b) A plan for English Language Learners ( ELLs) in US schools less than three years: 
       
 English Language Learners in US schools less than three years are given the mandated instructional time as prescribed by CR 
Part 154-2. In addition, these students also participate in the  After School program and Saturday/Holiday Academies. Special 
academic intervention is available when requested.  
(c) A plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years: 
        Long ‐ term ELL ’ s are offered a variety of academic intervention services. Though they are mainstreamed, they are 
invited to attend  the After School programs and the Saturday/Holiday Academies. Students receive intensive reading and/or 
math instruction that targets their individual needs. AIS members are always available to assist with small groups outside the 
classrooms. 
  
(d) A Plan for Long -term ELLs  (completed 7 years) 
       The programs are designed to help ELL acquire a level of English proficiency in listening, speaking, reading and writing. The 
types  of programs and amount of services a child receives are determined by his or her proficiency rating on the NYSESLAT. 
The school will continue to provide the student with experiences which will enrich their lives. They will continue to receive 
some forms of academic instruction, opportunities to interact socially with their English speaking peers in sports, clubs, and 
other extra curricular activities. 
  
(e) A Plan for Former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient) 
         
  Students who have attained proficiency on the NYSESLAT will continue to receive support from their classroom  
          teachers. Classroom teachers will be trained in the use of ENL strategies and methodologies to provide such support.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers will develop vocabulary through flashcards, word games, word work, and a variety of word building activities.A 
variety of ENL strategies will be utilized. Among them, scaffolding of texts and instructions, creating a classroom environment 
that is risk free and print rich with student created work, using lots of visuals and real world materials.  Students will be 
provided with kinesthetic, visual and oral instructions, and a variety of learning activities in the listening and computer 
centers.  Special instructional programs using a variety of computerized reading programs are in place to help our ELL students 
with Individual Education Plan (IEP) master both ELA and Math.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
An ELL student with an I.E.P is designated as Students with Disability (SWD) .He or she must participate in ENL instruction as    
              mandated by his or her I.E.P. The instructional support he or she receives is also based on his or her English profile.The 
instruction 
              that he or she receives follows the scaffolding matrix that teachers use in their instruction. ELLs received special 
instruction  
             tailored to their needs and capabilities. The students participate in  After School,  Saturday Academy, and Holiday 
Academy  
             intervention programs 
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Target population: ELL holdovers by grades 
  
Total number of students: 307 
  
Situation assessment: 
      Students' overall reading proficiency, on the NYS Test and the Teachers' College Assessment is below grade level 
requirement standard. As a sub-group, the ELL are   provided  with intervention reading strategies bot vertically and 
horizontally. Several approaches are implemented through After School program, Saturday/Holiday academies, Reading 
Recovery, Classroom Reading Libraries with books that are level and genre specific, the daily 45 minutes Drop Everything and 
Read (DEAR) sessions, and the school wide individual or groups of five student mentoring program in which all staff member: 
teachers, secretaries, Family workers, school aides, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, custodians, ancillary workers, 
school nurse, parent association members, parent coordinator, and parent volunteers engage in reading activities with 
students at specified times during the regular school day. These reading activities are in place from September to June in 2017-
18. Teacher Team and grade planning meetings twice weekly review instructional practices, suitability of reading resources, 
and student' work for accomplishments, shortcoming, and next step challenges to bring about an increase in reading 
proficiency by one reading level. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 Curriculum team has designed the early reading intervention program for ELL to include the five elements of effective 
instruction. Namely, building and using vocabulary as a curricular anchor; using visuals to reinforce concepts and vocabulary; 
implementing cooperative learning and peer-tutoring strategies; using native language strategically; and modulating cognitive 
and language demands. Vocabulary development is a critical element of our early reading intervention program. Reading 
instruction occurs in English simultaneously with English language development. Vocabulary development is integrated with all 
aspects of the instructional program. 
         
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs or interventions will be discontinued. However, there will be a shift in emphasis toward vocabulary build up. ELLs 
with improved vocabulary will read and write better; and will be better prepared to exit successfully from the Transitional 
Bilingual Program. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67 

 

 School programs are designed to meet the annual learning goals in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Sciences. However, 
scaffolding matrices are used to "fit and meet " the needs of each learner. ELLs are always invited to participate in all 
instructional activities within the school . Efforts are made to reach out to ELLs' parents in order to ensure that they fully 
participate in learning opportunity  programs offered by the school.  The principle of Universality is applied to all school 
programs developed to meet the learning of all the members of our school community. Extracurricular activities are designed 
and carried out to help the ELL re-encounter their culture and learn to assimilate their new culture (local library, community 
festivals, street theater, museum, park, zoo, and international circus). 
  
    ELL3, 4, 5 grade students'  reading intervention program is supported by explicit and direct instruction; and includes 
strategies to promote fluency. Our reading comprehension strategy calls for oral reading and corrective feedback; followed by 
classroom discussions and students' questioning. Emphasis is placed on engagement in structured academic talk. These 
interventions are constantly monitored and the data gathered are used to take corrective steps or make needed adjustments. 
The final goal of these interventions is to increase student achievement. 
      Our math intervention programs are designed to provide support for ELL students who have difficulty keeping up with day-
to-day expectations. They are also designed  to detect and provide ongoing support to students before they fall behind. 
Current interventions provide the opportunity for all students to learn Math regardless of part or early performance deficits. 
Selection of instructional materials and activities is intended to support student learning during class time and  in all 
intervention support programs. Math interventions start with short diagnostic assessments to screen for early detection of 
specific mathematical needs. Instructional actions are then taken to cater for those needs. The intervention  cycle in math 
includes follow-up assessments to  
determine whether students have made adequate progress, but more importantly,  to identify those who no longer need 
intervention, continue to need some intervention, or need more intensive intervention. 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Classroom-based interventions follow the Go Math instructional design but is adapted by every classroom teacher to 
continuously assesses ELLs. Special settings in the classroom and  supplemental instruction are provided by the classroom 
teacher. The math coach provides additional instructional  time that may range from 20 to 40 minutes four to five times a 
week to teachers of ELLs. Supplemental programs that occur outside of the daily mathematics lessons are implemented once a 
week to provide tutoring to students requiring more intensive assistance. In addition, ST Math, a digital program is 
incorporated in the instruction of ELLs; the program uses diagrams and symbols to unearth math concepts. On the ELA side the 
digital iReady program is used. It is a reading program that is aligned to the CCLS and uses vocabulary and pictures to provide 
practice in informational text and reading literacy. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The TBE program  is reinforced by one period of puris teaching i.e. students are taught strictly in their native language for one 
period in ELA and Math each day.  Native Language support is delivered through bilingual teachers and computerized reading 
program in Spanish. Academic instruction is in both English and Spanish. English language development is infused through ESL 
as well as through enrichment classes such as Art, Music, Computer Lab and Physical Education, which are taught in English. It 
is important to note that the ratio of English to Spanish instruction increases according to the student’s English language 
proficiency, until the student is ready to exit the program. English as a New Language (ENL) Programs is implemented  for a 
few students who speak the same language on the same grade.The ENL program has two components: language arts and 
interdisciplinary content knowledge. Language arts is delivered through ENL and/or English language arts methods and 
materials, to improve the ELL's level of English proficiency. The content area instruction is delivered using ENL methodologies 
and materials. Some time during the day, an ENL teacher removes the ELLs from their regular classrooms and provides 50-60 
minutes of ENL instruction. When a teacher integrates  with ELLs who  spend most of their day in a mainstream English 
classroom. Integration are implemented through "team-teaching” and “team-planning” that require the regular classroom

teacher and the ENL teacher to plan on a regular basis.Native language instruction is integrated into the regular classroom 
through the content areas using ESL standards-based methodologies  
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Age appropriate materials, books and other instructional tools are all chosen based on the learning needs of the ELL students. 
All the books provided to ELL through our reading intervention programs are leveled books. Reading progress of an ELL is 
constantly monitored to ensure that all the materials, computer programs, and books are adequate and helping students. 
Students begin their learning journey with a baseline test to determine their initial level of performance in English and math. 
The next exercise is to get the newly enrolled to set SMART learning goal. One reading goal is to read 30 books during the 
school year. ELL monitor their progress by entering on a chart the number of books read as they progress and producing a brief 
book report after reading each book. They are also expected to rate the text and state why they would or would not 
recommend the text to others for reading. Teachers use the Scaffolding Matrix instructional approach to design, develop, and 
deliver instruction that effectively meet the ages and grade levels of the ELL.  Children's cultural background and prior 
knowledge are often used to develop effective programs to meet the ELL's specific learning needs.  
  
  
  
   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
NA 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our administrative staff members know that entering a new school can be overwhelming, especially if the newcomers don't 
speak the language.To make the experience as welcoming as possible for the new students, staff members immediately notify 
the ELL/ENL teachers to initiate testing and determine if the students is eligible for ELLs' services. These newcomers are 
introduced to a staff member who wil chaperon them during the first days of school. Efforts are made to get the newcomers to 
meet other students who speak their language. A helpful tool is to introduce a newcomer to a native peer, so that he or she 
can begin immediately to hear and repeat the sounds of the new language in a non-threatening environment. Classroom 
teachers are encouraged to pay special attention to the newcomers and to inform the administration of non-conformity. The 
new student may have questions that are still unanswered. A special gathering for the newcomers is held. The Parent 
Coordinator uses the opportunity to develop partnerships with the new parents.   
As such, ELLs have access to all the academic programs and activities developed and implemented by the school. Parents are 
fully and thoroughly informed about such interventions through parents meeting organized by the Parent Coordinator and the 
Parent Association . These information sessions are carried out in Spanish to ensure that parents have all the information they 
need to make the right decisions with regard to their children's education.Thrice a week, ELL are offered the opportunity to 
participate in after school learning programs. Supplementary assistance is provided trough the Saturday and Holiday 
academies as well as the Community Based Organization, SCANNY. The latter provides services five days per week. Parents 
who speak a language other than Spanish receive translation and interpretation from teacher who can communicate in the 
language. for example, French, hatian Creole, etc.  
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

No language electives are offered to ELL students. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs:

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
1.The school pursues policies which support coherent and integrated professional development in the form of school-
sponsored workshops on topics such as cooperative learning techniques, meeting the needs of at-risk students, and Internet 
training for teachers. There is a coherent and integrated professional development plan that grows out of the  school's vision 
for student learning; and  to which teachers and school leaders are committed. School leaders consider student, teacher, and 
organizational learning a priority. The principal has current and substantive knowledge about effective teaching and learning 
for students and adults and knowledge about trends in effective professional development and the education of English 
Language Learners. The principal safeguards teacher and student time, engage the entire staff in taking responsibility for the 
education of English Language Learners, model collegial relationships with teachers and students, and participates actively in 
the learning community of the school. 
    
2.  Sufficient time and resources are allocated for professional development. Teachers  work together in new ways to improve 
student learning. They work together to tackle the complexities of teaching in a culturally diverse school.There is on-going 
professional development that promotes school-based inquiry. There exists a fusion of  ENL, bilingual, and content teachers or 
interdisciplinary teams of teachers to support the academic success of all students. Staff members are encouraged and given 
the opportunity to continually improve their ability to manage a student-centered classroom, accommodate heterogeneous 
arrangements, and integrate first and second language students into the content areas. Interdisciplinary teacher teams work 
collaboratively to develop and realign curriculum (maps, units of study, and pacing calendars), coordinate lesson plans, discuss 
student work, and share successful instructional practices. Staff members are expected to hold each other accountable 
through peer coaching, inter-visitations, peer evaluation, and teacher portfolio presentation.  During the school-based inquiry, 
teachers will seek information to explain their students' work. They will look at research and school-based professional 
development models, examine student achievement data, and the school's progress report, and create a plan to improve 
students' literacy as compared to peer schools and city-wide performances.  Additionally, teachers will engage in analyzing 
Common Core Learning Standards,  look deeper at student work, and review selected professional literature.

and implementation of academic interventions.The aim is to help ELL become fluent in listening, speaking, reading, and writing 
English. Parents will be coached to seek support to help their children learn. They will be directed during seminars and 
workshops for parents. Parents will be provided with information on how to take advantage of community-based programs 
designed to meet the learning needs of their children. Parents who are in need of translation services are accommodated by 
the staff members who are fluent in one or more languages  
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Paste response here:  
  The Parent Coordinator, coaches and the administration hold monthly workshops with parents. The focus of these meetings 
is primarily on how parents can contribute in the education of their children and helping to get them ready for the forth 
coming tests which will propel them to the next level of proficiency. The four areas of Reading, Speaking, Listening and Writing 
are central to the parent engagement during these meetings. Parents who could not attend are sent printed copies in English 
and Spanish. The parent Association plays an active part in mobilizing the parents for involvement. apart from the letter of 
notification of each session, telephone calls are made to days to the parents. parents who attend sign-in to register their 
presence.  
Activities mobilizing  involvement include: Monthly calendars; SLT meetings; Parent Coordinator's  information board; monthly 
parent metings; parents as chaperon on trips; parental social and educational trips.

program will allow the students an opportunity to master comprehension and writing skills at their own pace. 
The elected program will be in Spanish and English. The program would address the needs of English Language Learners including 
Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) and Long-term ELL (LTE).  It is intended to develop skills in reading 
comprehension, vocabulary, and writing. The program is designed for twelve different reading levels.Students will have access to 
high interest articles that are motivating and relevant to various areas of study, e.g., health, history, education, the environment, 
technology, business, spotlight on people, elections, and arts and entertainment. As an intervention, the program will provide 
teachers with differentiated literacy lesson and CCLS based performance data to align with  instruction for individual student's 
needs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Olivia Francis-Webber, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

There are 338 students registered in the school as in need of translation and oral interpretation. The Home 
Language Survey is used initially to determine the necessary communication method. The school communicates 
with parents in both English and Spanish in written form. On site, resident translators interpret as the need arises. 
There is one resident Bengali, a paraprofessional, who interprets whenever the situation demands. There are two 
French speaking teachers who also interpret as the need arises. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
