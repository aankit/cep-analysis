Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission: P.S. 152, in its diversity, is a mirror image of the community. It is a place with an incredibly talented and 
competent staff and one which promotes a passion for teaching and learning. Teacher scholarship, enhanced by 
professional learning and continuous reflection, is woven into the very fabric of our school. We serve the 
educational needs of our students and their families in all areas of the curriculum, with a particular emphasis in 
Literacy, Mathematics, Science, Technology and the arts. We continuously set high expectations to enhance the 
academic and social development of all students, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and students with 
disabilities (SWDs). Our responsibility extends to empower the school community with graduates who have been 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

nourished with intellectual discipline, readiness for the intermediate school experience, personal satisfaction, 
responsible citizenship, creativity, and civility, thus improving the quality of life. Here, children are honored and 
their efforts are celebrated.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 152 School of Science and Technology is a Pre K through 5th grade elementary school located in the Midwood 
section of Brooklyn, NY. Pre-K, Kindergarten, and grade 1 are housed in our Early Childhood Annex a few blocks 
away. We also share our main building (grades 2 through 5) with another elementary school. As a result, we have 
various spaces which we share in and outside the building. In addition, we are located right next to Brooklyn 
College, which enables us to have many student observers and teachers throughout the school year. We were 
awarded the 21st Century Grant, so PS 152 is a Community School.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school is comprised of approximately 661 students. The school’s population consists of 57.94% Black, 28.14% 
Hispanic, 7.56% Asian, 4% White, and 2% Other. The student body includes 50.08% males and 49.92% females with 
16.79% English as New Language Learners (ENLs). Students with disabilities (SWDs) make up 19.21% of the 
population. Forty percent of the SWDs are Self-contained, which means they are in a small class setting. PS 152 has 
a Self-contained class and an ICT class on every grade. The SWDs receive mandated services such as counseling, 
speech, physical and occupational therapy, etc. SWDs are placed in the appropriate settings, i.e., Self Contained, 
ICT, or SETSS. The two main languages of our ENLs are Spanish and Haitian Creole. The other languages spoken by 
our students are Bengali, Urdu, Uzbek, Arabic, French, Tajik, Russian, Bosnian, and French Haitian. The ENL students 
receive mandated push in/pull out services based on their proficiency levels. The attendance rate year to date is 
94%.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

P.S. 152 has demonstrated progress again in Rigorous Instruction specifically in mathematics. To enhance 
instruction and in an effort to improve our students’ performance, PS 152 will continue the partnership with 
Teachers College Reading Writing Project (TCRWP). In reading workshop, students are exposed to various genres of 
literature/informational text and are encouraged to read independently for a period of time ranging from 15 to 45 
minutes depending on their reading levels. Students study character development, theme, making inferences and 
author's craft. Students think deeply and synthesize information to draw conclusions and provide evidence for 
arguments. During writing workshop, students write on a variety of topics across genres such as Informational, 
Narrative, and Opinion/Argument. In the early childhood grades, students sketch and label, write across pages and 
are provided paper choice. In the upper grades, students develop claims and support them with reasons using text 
evidence; analyze characters' motives, actions and decisions in a story to describe them (traits) using precise words.  

Additionally, the Math Staff Developer supports teachers and enhance their content knowledge of mathematics 
and strengthen their instruction through coaching, intervisitations, and inquiry. The Math Staff Developer will 
continue implementing various school wide math activities (100th Day, Pi Day, Math Jeopardy, etc.) to enhance 
students' interest in the subject area. Teachers in grades K through 5 will continue implementing the Strategic 
Problem Solving Initiative, Math Talks during instruction, and the math centers model. During the 2018-2019 school 
year, teachers across grades will include gallery walks to the Problem Solving periods, so students can learn the 
strategies from other groups of students and share their thinking.  

Strong Family-Community Ties is another element P.S. 152 has continued to show progress in. There has been an 
increase in parent attendance at school wide meetings and workshops since becoming a Community School. During 
the 2018-2019 school year, The Trust for Public Land and The Working Group has partnered with PS 152 for a school 
yard renovation project. The design team will include administration, teachers, and upper grade students 
(particularly students in the STEM cohort). The students will visit other schools who have recently renovated their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

school yards and create a design, which will then be voted on by parents and the school community. Because of our 
geographical locations we are linked to Brooklyn College, which provides many student teachers and observers, 
and to Midwood and Madison High Schools, which provides student volunteers who assist our students with 
reading, writing, and mathematics. P.S. 152 has been able to creatively celebrate the arts. All students in grades K 
through 5 participate in a visual arts program and as of September 2017, all classes in K through 5 have physical 
education periods. Our students participate in the District 22 Dance Festival, Theatre Showcase, Science Expo, and 
Chorus. Beginning in the Fall 2018, our fifth grade students will be collaborating with Hudde middle school on a 
STEM/Coding lab activities.  

A key area of focus for PS 152 is Supportive Environment. To continue supporting the social and emotional growth 
of all our students and provide a welcoming atmosphere, P.S. 152 has created a PBIS team for the 2018-2019 school 
year. Furthermore, the teachers will continue utilizing the Sanford Harmony Program, which includes a daily 
morning meeting with students and community building activities. Administration increased the amount of time 
dedicated to Sanford Harmony in the school wide schedule for classes across all grades. A full time Intervention 
Specialist will work with small groups of students to help them resolve issues and push into classes to conduct 
meditation sessions. The school’s full time Guidance Counselor meets with small groups of at-risk students during 
the school day as well as mandated students. Our full time SAPIS worker will also push into classes to teach 
students life skills. As a school community, after the Pledge of Allegiance, we recite our School Wide Pledge: We 
will always try our best. We will show attention with our eyes and ears. We will show respect for ourselves and 
everyone in our school community. Our morning announcements are spoken in three different languages: English, 
Spanish, and Haitian Creole. Additionally, PS 152 implements restorative practices such as conflict resolution,

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
An analysis of Go Math! Assessment data from 2017-2018 shows progress in grades K through 5 from the Beginning of 
Year (BOY) Performance Assessment to the End of Year (EOY) Performance Assessment. For example, Kindergarten 
students had a proficiency growth of 29% from an average of 52.8% in September 2017 (BOY) to an average of 82.4% 
in May 2018 (EOY). First Grade students had a proficiency growth of 31% from an average of 54.2% in October 2017 
(BOY) to an average of 85.2% in May 2018 (EOY). Second grade students demonstrated a proficiency growth of 27.5% 
from an average of 49.6% in October 2017 (BOY) to an average of 77.1% in May 2018 (EOY). Third grade students 
established a proficiency growth of 28.2% from a grade average of 38.3% in October 2017 to an average of 66.6% in 
May 2018 (EOY). Fourth graders produced a proficiency growth of 24.8% from an average of 29.5% in October 2017 
(BOY) to an average of 60% in May 2018 (EOY). The fifth grade students ended the year with an average growth of 
13.5% based on a proficiency increase from 31.6% in October 2017 (BOY) to 45.2% in May 2018.  

The data from the 2018 NYS Math exam shows a three (3) percent increase in proficiency from the 2017 NYS Math 
exam. In grades 3 through 5, the areas that improved from 2017-2018 are all strands of Geometry. Grades 3 and 4 
showed an increase in comparing fractions and grade 5 showed an increase in multiplying and dividing fractions. 
Additionally, grade 4 students showed an increase in all questions (multiple choice and constructed responses) 
compared to 2017 results. Overall, grades 3 through 5 showed a decline in the Numbers and Operations strand.  

Based on this data, we will continue to implement the Math Talks at the beginning of each math lesson, math centers 
model, and Problem Solving Fridays. We will also include gallery walks into the Problem Solving Fridays so students 
can learn additional strategies and share their mathematical thinking with their peers. Our priority is strengthening 
our students' mathematical fluency and vocabulary to increase their overall achievement.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 60% of all students in grades K through 5 will show progress in math by 20% as measured by the Go Math! 
End of Year Performance Assessment when compared to the baseline (Beginning of Year Go Math! Performance 
Assessment).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Overall, the total amount of incidents (levels 1-5) increased from 200 during the 2016-2017 to 286 during the 2017-
2018 school year. However, there is a decrease in removals from 2016-2017 (34) to this year (30). The majority of 
incidents take place in the classroom (63) and cafeteria (58).  

According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, 46% of teachers responded that students behave well in class even 
when the teacher isn't watching and 50% of teachers say that adults at their school recognize disruptive behavior as 
social-emotional learning opportunities.  

A priority need is to adopt and organize evidence-based behavioral interventions into an integrated continuum that 
enhances academic and social behavior outcomes for all students, provides teachers with professional learning and 
resources in restorative approaches (specifically de-escalation), and decreases the amount of incidents within our 
school.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of the implementation of PBIS and Sanford Harmony Social-Emotional program, there will be 
a 2% decrease in the number of incidents compared to the 2017-2018 school year as indicated in the Online 
Occurrence Reporting System (OORS).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the most recent data from Teachers College (TC) Running Records shows that 15.2% of grade 1 ELL students 
are at or above grade level; 18.5% of grade 2 ELL students are at or above grade level; 11% of grade 3 ELL students are 
at or above grade level; 4.3% of grade 4 ELL students are at or above grade level; and 51% of grade 5 ELL students are 
at or above grade level.  

NYSESLAT 2018 data shows ELLs in first, third and fifth grades showed progress in moving proficiency levels. However, 
Kindergarten, grades 2 and 4 did not show progress. As a result, the administration has chosen the 2nd grade to be 
the focus of the Continuous Learning Community grant, which concentrates on raising ELL achievement through data 
driven inquiry.  

An analysis of NYSESLAT Proficiency levels compared to ELA Levels using the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) shows 4 
emerging, 10 transitioning, and 1 expanding student(s) scored a level 1 on the NYS ELA; 3 transitioning, and 12 
expanding students scored a level 2; 1 expanding and 2 commanding students scored a level 3; and 1 commanding 
student scored a level 4.  

Additionally, the results from the 2018 NYS ELA exam shows a decrease of 1% in the number of students at 
proficiency level when compared to last year’s (2017) results from 30% to 29%. While Grade 3 achieved growth 
responding to multiple choice questions, there was a decline in constructed responses, specifically with regard to 
standard RI 3.2. Students showed growth when answering multiple choice questions involving main idea, but had 
significant difficulty answering constructed responses. Grade 4 is above the city average in regard to word meaning in 
literature, but they are significantly below in word meaning in informational texts. Grade 5 had the most significant 
decline compared to 2017. They were below the city average in all but 2 standards.  

Therefore, a priority need is for Teacher Inquiry Teams, both vertically and across grades, to focus on analyzing 
student work of ELL students to plan specially designed instruction, which include the hallmarks of Advance Literacy.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of collaborative professional learning opportunities and data driven inquiry to analyze student 
work and assessments by teachers, 60% of ELLs in grades K through 5 will increase a minimum of two (2) reading levels 
as measured by Teachers College (TC) running records.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The PS 152 school administration believes that in order to maintain student achievement we must continue to 
support teachers’ instructional practices. A review of Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) data for the 2017-2018 
school year indicates the following in the components of domain 1: Component 1a is 3.14% (Developing), 72.25% 
(Effective), 24.61% (Highly Effective); and component 1e is 7.85% (Developing), 86% (Effective), 7% (Highly Effective). 
Component 3d is 5.24% (Developing), 80.10% (Effective), and 14.66% (Highly Effective). Additionally, school 
administration will continue to observe teachers in mathematics 50% and ELA 50%.  

Therefore, a priority need is for the school administration to support teachers' instructional practices in order to 
increase the level of student achievement and strengthen teacher's content knowledge by creating specially designed 
lessons to meet the needs of all students (ELLs, SWDs, general education). Additionally, we revised our school wide 
Instructional Focus to: Teachers will promote more effective forms of assessment across all grades and subjects by 
articulating clear learning objectives so students can monitor progress towards all their learning goals. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of continuous cycles of classroom observations that result in explicit next steps, and 
differentiated professional learning opportunities, there will be a 4% increase in effective and/or highly effective ratings 
for Danielson component 3d: Using assessment in instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In recognition of the critical role of parents as partners with the school, we are committed to offering parent activities 
of interest to parents. In addition, there will be workshops to support parents in addressing students’ social and 
emotional needs. The attendance at workshops in the past has been low (approximately 5-8 parents attend our 
monthly PA meetings and parent workshops) and therefore, we will be focusing on providing workshops focused on 
curriculum and student achievement.  

According to the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, 68% of parents state that since the beginning of the school year they 
have been asked to volunteer time to support their school, and 89% of parents said that they get opportunities to visit 
their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an activity with their child.  

Therefore, a priority need is to offer parents a variety of opportunities to be involved in their children’s educational 
experience.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, in order to foster stronger family and community ties and to support the school's endeavor in improving 
student achievement, there will be a 2% increase in workshops and/or parent activities that engage families in 
curriculum compared to 2017 as measured by attendance sheets.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

22K152 Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 152K, in compliance with the Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and 
support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents 
informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. 
Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

PS 152’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners (ELLs) and students with disabilities 
(SWDs). The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the 
proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 152K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The Community School strategy will provide students with the following:  

- ARTS, sports, and STEM programs during ELT 

- Mental health services during the day and during ELT 

- Parent workshops, Community School Leadership, and Parent Meetings, Engagement activities for the school 
community 

- Professional Development for staff, teachers, and administration 

- Community school culture and sensitivity trainings and support for staff, teachers, and administration  

- Attendance outreach and support  

 

The impact this will have on the academic outcome of our students is:  

- Students make better choices when faced with difficult or challenging situations. Students feel safe and will reach 
out to someone when in need.  

- Students are able to complete their class work in a timely manner.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, 60% of targeted students whose attendance falls at 90% or below will increase by 2% as measured by 
ATS.  

 

By June 2019, parents will be provided with monthly workshops that are aligned to the district's family engagement 
on topics that focus on social/emotional learning, comprehensive literacy, and college and career readiness.  

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

Achieving our attendance goal, increasing attendance by 2%, will improve student academic outcomes. When 
students are late or absent they miss instruction. Consistent instruction and supports will increase student outcomes.  

 

During parent workshops, parents will receive strategies and supports on how to work with their child when they are 
experiencing anger and frustrations.  

 

Mental health supports for students provides them with skills and strategies that allow them to make better choices 
when facing anger provoking or frustrating situations.  

 

Parents will have a better understanding of the college choice and the college application process. Parents will be 
provided with information that will assist them with ensuring their students are on the right track for college and 
careers.  

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
PS 152 will provide an after-school program for English Language Learners (ELLs) to support 
language development and high academic achievement in Math and ELA.  Our ELLs receive 
integrated co-teaching and stand-alone ENL services during the regular school day as mandated 
by CR Part 154.  To complement their regular service, our  after-school programs will provide 
our ELL's  in grades one to four with intense instruction, so that they meet  grade level 
standards  in literacy and mathematics as well as in English language development, as measured 
by the New York State English Language Arts (ELA) and Math exams, and the New York State 
English as a Second Language Achievement  Test (NYSESLAT). According to 
recent  NYSESLAT data, students have difficulty  with reading and writing. Therefore, our 
program will focus on developing writing skills as well as fundamental reading concepts. Math 
instruction will focus on the acquisition of content vocabulary and  the application of 
concepts. The program will be offered to grades one to four.  Class size will be approximately 
20-25 students.  The ELL program will begin in November and continue through the end of 
May.  It will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays afternoons from 2:25 p.m to 3:35 p.m. 
The language of instruction will be English, with supplemental native language supports. Four 
teachers will provide instruction: three certified ENL teachers  and one teacher certified in 
common branch with experience teaching ELLs. To support parents,  our ENL Department will 
provide workshops for parents throughout the school year  that will provide  them with 
strategies  to support their children academically.

Our ENL Department will offer Professional Development for classroom teachers. Additionally, 
professional development for teachers of ELLs will be conducted during our  regular sessions of 
professional development on Mondays done by the ENL teachers/Teachers.  Some of the topics 
will include: "Collaborative Teaching", "Top Five Online Resources for ELLs,""Vocabulary 
Strategies and Activities," "Preparing for the NYSESLAT," "Strategies for Engaging Parents of 
ELLs," "Advanced Literacy", and "Students in Beginning Stages of Language Acquisition (K to 
5)."  
Throughout the year, the ENL teachers meet with classroom teachers of ELLs during preparation 
periods to provide modifications and additional supports to improve ELL access to the math and 
literacy curriculum. 
These professional learning opportunities will focus on best practices when teaching ELLs in 
order to increase student achievement.

Begin description here:            
PS 152 offers many opportunities for parents of English Language Learner (ELL) students to 
become involved in the school’s programs and activities.  Invitations and notices of important 
school events are sent home in the parents' preferred home language.  In addition, our School 
Messenger voice message system leaves messages for parents about important school events in 
their home language.  We provide translation services for parents of ELLs during Parent Teacher 
Conferences. In addition, our ENL teachers along with the Director of 21st Century will provide 
workshops for parents on Tuesdays during our designated parent engagement time as well as 
after school based on a survey of parent needs and interests. Reminders and invites will be sent 
to parents through Classroom Dojo that is translated to the parents preferred language. This year, 
a workshop for parents of ELLs will be held in our Main Building. The event, titled "Parent 
Workshop for Parents of ELLs: Preparing for the NYSESLAT," will be hosted by the ENL 
teachers.  At this event, parents will learn about NYSESLAT, how the ENL program will prepare 
their children for the test, and how they can assist their children at home.  Refreshments will be 
served, vocabulary learning resources, home literacy tips, testing information and library card 
applications will be distributed, and parent feedback will be solicited.  Additionally, ENL 
students and their families will be invited to a NYSESLAT preparation party, with learning 
games designed to rev up student and family motivation prior to NYSESLAT 
administration.  Furthermore, a Celebration of Culture Day will be set up to celebrate 
diversity. Invitations in parent's home language, agendas and attendance sheets will be reviewed 
by administration and maintained in a binder.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) Assessments for independent reading levels. These 
assessments are administered five times throughout the year. This data provides valuable information on students’ phonemic 
awareness, fluency, and reading comprehension, as well as their progress in these areas throughout the year. The data helps 
identify which ELLs need remediation in early literacy skills. The data also helps classroom teachers to form groups for guided 
reading at appropriate instructional levels. Our June 2018 running records data shows that 40 students moved at least one or 
two reading levels throughout the year and 104 students moved three or more levels.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to ensure that our  ELLs demonstrate progress in reading, our school has increased our emphasis on guided reading by 
providing a guided reading library and professional development to teachers. All teachers of ELLs and the ENL certified 
teachers share a common prep period to facilitate inquiry, sharing of best practices, and co-planning. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our school uses NYSESLAT results to evaluate the success of our ESL program. We also use TCRWP independent reading level 
data to evaluate our program. The  running record data for the ’17-’18 school year shows that 26% of ELLs  moved at least one 
to two reading levels and 69.8% moved three or more levels. Our school also uses GO Math as a summative assessment to 
track the student’s progress at the beginning of the year, mid year and end of the year to asses the students performance. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

At  the beginning of the school year all students, including Ell's are administered tests in reading and writing to establish a 
baseline of student performance and identify students who are not meeting specific benchmarks and criteria relative to peers 
of the same grade level. Ell's whose dominant language is Spanish are administered Spanish Lab test to determine if the 
students are literate in their native language so that supplemental materials in Spanish could be used to create high quality 
instruction tailored to the needs of ALL students and helping students transfer literacy skills developed in the students' native 
language to English. ENL teachers collaborate with  classroom teachers  to provide cognitively challenging instruction while 
simultaneously providing ELL's with the English Language development support through dialogue, questioning,  sharing ideas, 
providing background knowledge, clarifying vocabulary, using visual and context clues.In these instructional conversations the 
teachers listen carefully make guesses about intended meaning, and adjust responses to assist students' efforts.ELL's  progress 
is continuously monitored through teachers conference notes, running records, math unit tests and writing performance tasks. 
The data collected is used to make changes in instruction and  or services to meet the needs of the students who do not make 
academic progress at expected rates. In cases where performance assessments determine that some ELL's need targeted 
instruction in addition to core instruction, they are recommended to receive academic interventions in reading and math. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
     At the beginning of the school year, classroom teachers assess the students learning styles to facilitate effective learning. 
They provide interventions for visual learners with pictures, graphics using smart boards, displaying written key words to 
support text information. Auditory learners are encouraged to participate in oral discussions , presentations  and group 
collaborations. Tactile and kinesthetic learners are provided opportunities to participate in hands on and  movement activities. 
       Our grade specific inquiry teams include ENL Teachers to ensure progress monitoring of ELL's . The inquiry teams make 
educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction and or services. When a student is not making sufficient academic 
progress, they are then recommended to receive intervention.   
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
School wide 44.5% of our ELL students scored commanding and expanding on the 2017 NYSESLAT. 27% scored transitioning. 
25 % scored emerging and 9% scored entering,  Most of the Ell's who scored at the entering and emerging levels were either 
new admits or SWD students. In the coming year, we will focus on providing these students with additional intervention 
services and intensive language development opportunities. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teachers work closely with classroom teachers and the literacy coach to ensure that second language development is 
considered in instructional decisions. All teachers of ELLs and the ENL certified teachers share a common prep period to 
facilitate inquiry, sharing of best practices, and co-planning. All teachers of ELLs receive professional development. Past 
professional development included a session on collaborative teaching in the ENL classroom on strategies teachers can 
incorporate in the everyday classroom.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

            Our ELL students are all grouped based on their proficiency level into classes on each grade level.  This 
facilitates integrated ENL instruction. As per CR Part-154, our entering and emerging students receive 360 minutes a 
week, transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction. Our commanding 
students receive the mandated 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL instruction for an additional two years. Stand-
alone ENL is delivered by one of the three certified ENL teachers. Integrated ENL is delivered through co-teaching with 
the classroom teacher and a certified ENL teacher. Our SWD students are serviced in both a push-in and pull-out ENL 
models depending on their needs and  proficiency levels.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 The school creates a program that ensures that the ENL teachers co-teach during  the mandated number of minutes of 
integrated ENL/ELA (180 minutes for students who scored Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding and at least 90 
minutes for students who scored Commanding/Proficient in the last two years). The school schedule is also created to 
facilitate the mandated minutes of stand-alone ELA (180 for students who scored Entering and Emerging). 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Literacy, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies instruction is delivered to ELLs through scaffolded instruction.  Teachers 
provide access to grade-level content area instruction through a wide variety of strategies and practices.  To build background 
knowledge, teachers employ visual supports such as pictures and videos, as well as scaffolded discussion opportunities that 
allow ELLs to practice using new vocabulary and academic language structures to explore new concepts before reading.  To 
build academic language proficiency, teachers provide explicit instruction in vocabulary and sentence structure and allow 
children to practice the new language in student-to-student discussion.  Literacy instruction is differentiated to meet the needs 
of students of various levels of English vocabulary knowledge and phonemic awareness.  Teachers provide opportunities for 
independent reading at each student's independent reading level to build fluency and comprehension.Teachers provide 
guided reading with students of similar independent reading level of texts at a slightly higher level to build word knowledge, 
and scaffolded reading of grade-level texts through whole-class shared reading, close reading in small groups and partnerships, 
and the use of text-dependent questions to promote higher-order thinking and deep investigation of complex texts. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Our instruction is monolingual but whenever possible we utilize bilingual staff members.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a.  All our 3  SIFE students, as well as ELLS who share the SIFE characteristics, receive intensive reading remediation services. 
b. Our population of 98 Newcomers (0 to 3 years of service) receive ENL instruction that progresses from basic vocabulary and 
grammar to reading fluency and academic vocabulary instruction.  We use the Harcourt Picture Dictionary for Children, picture 
cards, leveled libraries, bilingual books and the Explode the Code series to deliver vocabulary, grammar, fluency and 
comprehension instruction. Students also progress through online resources such as Imagine 
Learning, BrainPopESL lessons, Raz-kids and Starfall online, both at school and home. 
c.  Our 34 developing ELLs (4 to 6 years of service) receive intensive writing instruction to remediate their greatest area of 
difficulty.  This involves teaching each of the three CCLS Writing standards for text types in a coherent fashion, providing both 
process and performance oriented writing opportunities.  In our writing program, writing is closely connected with reading, so 
that students respond directly to texts.  In writing process instruction, ELLs receive additional instruction in revision, and 
frequently go through several cycles of feedback and self-evaluation to develop the ability to recognize problems in content, 
organization, and mechanics that interfere with meaning 
d. We do not have any long-term ELLs. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  Teachers of ELL-SWDs provide access to grade-level academic content and accelerated language development by scaffolding 
academic content while employing language supports. These supports include developing prior content knowledge, using 
visual supports, and introducing the accountable talk model to develop academic language in peer-to-peer 
discussions.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs also provide support with sentence structure and phonemic awareness. These practices are 
differentiated based on the language and other academic needs of each student.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs in the lower grades receive push-in ENL instruction. When necessary, ELL-SWDs will work in pull-out groups with the 
ENL teacher. These groups will only span two consecutive grades and will provide access to grade level content and English 
language development. The ELL-SWDs in the upper grades receive more visuals and scaffold materials to achieve their goals.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Classroom instruction offers routine targeted interventions in literacy and math.  Small group work is differentiated according 
to student needs. Our math program, Go Math, offers differentiated activities within each day's lessons, and teachers routinely 
work with small groups in content areas. Students that were identified as needing intervention are being provided with extra 
support throughout the week by intervention specialist in small pull-out groups. if a student is really struggling in academics 
the student is put on the PPC list. As a team, the student's strengths and concerns are discussed and collaboratively  an action 
plan for the student is developed and is discussed monthly when the meetings are held to discuss.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Out of our ELL population 27% of students scored high, in grades K-5 in the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing. Based on the data received we plan to supplement classroom instruction with technology that differentiates 
instruction for ELL students with disabilities, and entering/emerging readers. The school has implemented the Up the Ladder 
writing program to differentiate instruction for ELLs. the upcoming school year we will be implementing the TC phonics 
program to help students with phonemic awareness.  
 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not had a bilingual program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.They participate in visual arts, dance, and music programs provided by 
our school and Brooklyn College students. We also have a student chorus that ELLs are invited to participate in. After school 
we have a Title III ELL Academy program and Enrichment Academy program. All ELL students are invited to participate. Our 
school models inclusion of ELLs every day through our morning announcements, which students deliver in English, Spanish, 
and Haitian Creole. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Science instruction is supported by Amplify, which engages in deep scientific understanding and incorporates all the different 
learning styles for students to succeed.  Social studies instruction is supported by Passport which is Social Studies include units 
of study as well as a text documents, books, and sources to support rigorous instruction and student inquiry.  Classroom 
teachers use sets of iPads/thinkpads, the mobile laptop lab, document projectors, and SMARTboards to deliver multimedia 
content.  Classroom instruction follows teacher-created curriculum maps across the content areas and grades which align 
content with specific scaffolds, resources, and modifications to support ELL learning, including graphic organizers, mentor 
texts, books on tape, de-codable books, and eTexts.  ELLs have access in the classroom and at home to technology programs 
including GoMath, RAZ-Kids, Discovery Education, and BrainPopESL. We are also looking into the National geographic 
Newcomers Kit In the USA (K-5). 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Throughout the school year, our ELLs receive instruction in the use of and opportunities to use bilingual dictionaries, picture 
dictionaries, bilingual picture dictionaries. Our ENL teachers encourage students to retain fluency in the native language and to 
attain literacy in the native language as well.  An emphasis is placed on social studies content that values student knowledge of 
foreign cultures and geography.  Bilingual or home-language texts are used on occasion to supplement English-language 
content-area reading materials. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All the resources and materials used for academic instruction of ELLs correspond to ELLs’ age and grade levels. ELLs remain in 
their grade-level classrooms for literacy instruction, which is co-taught by the ENL and classroom teachers. Teachers of ELLs 
offer differentiated texts and strategies for ELLs to allow access to the grade-level content and literacy learning.       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
To ensure the continuity of ELL progression classroom instruction follows teacher-created curriculum maps across the content 
areas and grades which align content with specific scaffolds, resources, and modifications to support ELL learning. To 
coordinate efforts instructors provide the next year teachers with student portfolios featuring examples of student work and 
end of year assessments.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At present we do not have any programs to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year.  New 
ELLs who enroll throughout the school year receive instruction in basic vocabulary and receive intensive oral language 
development opportunities. New ELLs are also introduced, when ever possible, to staff members who speak their home 
language. New ELLs are also paired with a student in their classroom who speaks their home language in order to ease the 
transition.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do not offer any foreign language instruction. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:    We do not follow the DL model at our school.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All school personnel who work with ELLs (general and special education teachers, subject area teachers, paraprofessionals, 
related service providers, Parent Coordinator, etc.) participate in ongoing professional development during the school’s 
designated professional learning time and during Chancellor’s Conference Days. Some of the topics addressed in professional 
development include identifying effective techniques, approaches, and interventions, writing language objectives, and 
scaffolding academic content for our ELL population. Teachers of ELLs have many opportunities throughout the year to attend 
professional development sessions offered by the Department of English Language Learners. Additionally, ENL teachers meet 
once a month for Ambassador Meetings to receive additional support in helping ELLs engage with CCLS curriculum. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our Parent Coordinator and Director of our After School program provide several workshops throughout the year to parents. 
Support was also offered to the parents of ELLs in fifth grade to assist ELLs as they transition to middle school.  The school 
provides support in the form of facilities, materials, and translation services for these workshops and others.  The school also 
provides a large message board in a prominent location in the school entryway with notices of middle school open houses and 
middle school application workshops.  Furthermore, we provide middle schools with elaborated information about each 
student we matriculate. Our ENL teachers provide professional development to all teachers (Collaborative teaching techniques 
to use in the ELL classroom). Attendance records, the agenda, and all materials presented are kept on file by the ENL teacher. 
Further ELL-specific professional development is attended through the Department of English Language Learners and other 
institutions such as Teacher’s College and the UFT.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents are welcomed to visit the ENL teachers during Parent involvement time on Tuesdays, as well as on the Parent/Teacher 
Conference days, and individual appointments that are convenient for the parent. For translation, we either use qualified staff 
members or over-the-phone interpretation from the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  These meetings will take place 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 

during designated parental involvement time as well as during ENL teachers’ preps as needed. If necessary, meetings can be 
conducted over the phone. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELLs are introduced to the school and its staff during Open School Week, when all parents are invited to attend 
grade-level and all-grade Parent Orientations.  We send home invitations in the languages indicated by parents as the one 
preferred for written communication.  Our School Messenger system delivers recorded messages about school events in 
several languages. The ENL Coordinator and Parent Coordinator host workshops specific to parents of ELLs, including a 
Common Core Math meeting with resources in multiple languages, a state testing orientation (which covers accommodations 
for ELLs) and a NYSESLAT overview. Parents of ELLs are encouraged to participate in all Parent Association (PA) meetings and 
extracurricular activities, such as school trips, performances, and holiday celebrations.  They are encouraged to attend ENL 
Adult Education classes and  Family Nights to become more involved in their children's education. We are looking to conduct a 
Celebration of Culture Day to celebrate the diversity in out school.  
 

Additional Information

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gina Smalley, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At the beginning of each school year, we run the ATS Report of Adult Preferred Language (RAPL.) We use this to 
generate a list of all students whose parents indicated a language other than English for oral and/or written 
communication from the school. When distributing letters and other materials, we use this list to ensure that 
translated copies are distributed to all families whose preference was so indicated. When making oral contact 
with parents, we use bilingual staff members to interpret, or use the Over-the-Phone Interpretation service.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We use these data in ATS (RAPL report) to inform our School Messenger system to deliver telephone messages to 
parents in the appropriate language. We also utilize the notification documents provided on the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit's intranet site. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our School will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and what 
resources are available to meet compliance by displaying the Welcome poster, having the Parents’ Bill of Rights easily 
accessible in the Main Office in different languages, Parents’ Guide to Language Access, and the Language ID Guide at 
the security desk and main office.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

On registration, the Pupil Accounting Secretary administers the survey of preferred language for communication with 
the school. She enters these preferences into ATS. The ESL teacher uses the ATS Report of Adult Preferred Language 
(RAPL) to create a list of students whose families require oral interpretation or written translation services. Before 
distributing letters, we refer to this list in order to ensure that all parents receive letters in the language of their 
preference. In addition, we use these data to inform our School Messenger system to deliver telephone messages to 
parents in the appropriate language. Teachers also use Class Dojo to send out behavior, reminders and special events 
going on in the classroom which can be translated to the parents preferred language. We also utilize the notification 
documents provided on the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site. Parent Engagement Events are 
translated and sent to our families in preferred languages.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will administer a survey (translated into preferred languages) to ask parents what workshops they would 
be interested in attending. This survey will be administered at parent-teacher conferences and meetings with parents 
of English Language Learners.
