Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

With the vision of P.S. 11 as a community that loves to learn, individual talents are embraced and achievements are 
celebrated. Our P.S. 11 family draws from life's experience to better connect literary, mathematical, scientific and 
social concepts. The Community partners with us to develop the Whole Child and to help all students on their journey 
towards college and career readiness. Standards are set high so that students can achieve, perhaps even surpass, 
their own expectations.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The mission of P.S. 11 is to inspire future leaders by responding to diverse learning styles, while maintaining 
standards, inquiry-based instruction. By providing children with more leadership roles such as setting and evaluating 
their own goals, we will empower P.S. 11 students to creatively approach their learning. This foundation will allow 
them to approach learning challenges beyond their school experience. Our “Lead by Example” model will foster an 
environment that inspires excellence in leadership, scholarship and citizenship. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Public School 11 (Governor Thomas Dongan) is an elementary school with 320 students from pre-kindergarten 
through grade 5. The school population comprises 18% Black, 36% Hispanic, 33% White, and 12% Asian students. The 
student body includes 15% English language learners and 20% special education students. Boys account for 52% of 
the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 94%. 

The school is Well Developed on its 2018 Quality Review in all areas of the Framework for Great Schools. The area of 
celebration is aligning assessments to curricula, using ongoing assessment and grading practices, and analyzing 
information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels . This 
important foundational work aligns directly to the school's vision and mission, and to the following elements of the 
Framework: Rigorous Instruction, Strong Family-Community Ties, Effective School Leadership, Supportive 
Environment, and Collaborative Teachers.  

The impact to date is the school in Good Standing on the New York State Accountability Report, yearly progress on the 
School Quality Snapshot and Measures of Student Learning data, and 100% on the Measures of Leadership Practice 
on the Principal's Performance Review. It should be noted that there was an average of 13% gains on the 2017 New 
York State English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics Exams for all students. There was an additional 7% gain this 
year in ELA and Math. This makes a 20% increase in student achievement in the last two years.  

The school credits the following partnerships for their ongoing success in improving student achievement: 

1) Internal Department of Education support such as English Language Arts and Math Tax Levy funding for after school 
test preparation, Title III enrichment, Title I Parent Involvement and Professional Development; 

2) External community-based support such as councilmanic funding for the after school enrichment and Academic 
Intervention services during the school day, and Parent Teacher Association sponsorship of Summer Reading 
Challenge; 

3) Civic groups, such as the Huttner-Pasqualini American Legion Post, providing lessons on leadership and 
government; 

4) Private grants such as the Staten Island Foundation for Orton-Gillingham reading intervention training, Staten 
Island Maker Space STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), and Bravo Broadway through Music 
for Many Inc. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school has a large special education population and disparate data demonstrates that a concerted focus must 
remain on improving outcomes for students with Individual Education Plans (IEP’s): 

1) Improve parent involvement 

2) Improve Social Emotional Development 

3) Improve the quality of instruction through Orton Gillingham and other specialized programs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

4) Provide targeted programs before, during and after school.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Collaborative Teachers - This area has sustained Well-Developed ratings on the 2018 Quality Review, therefore it is an 
Area of Celebration. 

Rigorous Instruction - This area is Well-Developed, as evidenced by the School Quality Snapshot (4/4). Although the 
school improved to a 4/4 on the Snapshot, there is still room for growth around rigorous instruction and student 
achievement, particularly for IEP students, and particularly for conceptual understanding in mathematics. 

Strong Family and Community Ties - This area is in Focus, as a direct alignment to the new Multidimensional Principal 
Performance Rubric, and the chancellor and district's vision.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
● According to the school’s 2018 Quality Review, teachers were Well Developed in creating a rigorous curricula, 
aligned to the Common Core Standards. Teachers used Item Skills Analysis to better understand and infuse the 
standards. A goal will be set and monitored throughout the 2018- 2019 school year, in order for teachers to help 
students deepen their conceptual understanding of mathematics across the grades. 

● The school’s strengths in this element include: 

a. Teachers co-constructed standards-based lesson objectives with students. They combined the ReadyGen and Go 
Math resources with enrichment programs such as PBL (Problem Based Learning), STEAM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) activities, and engageNY.  

b. Teachers used student trending data during weekly Impact/Inquiry Team meetings for curricula adjustments.  

● The school’s needs in this element are: 

a. Integrate the Algebra for All (A4A) model into current unit plans. Students with IEP's will have increased 
opportunity to peer discuss mathematical concepts.  

b. Teachers and students will create a continuum in mathematics across grade levels, with a heavy emphasis on 
conceptual understanding.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 75% (11 out of 15) of classroom teachers will move up at least one level in Danielson Component 1a 
(Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy) within mathematics, as evidenced by the Advance rating system.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

* School Leaders will meet with District-Support personnel and 
peer schools around Dividing and Conquering the A4A standards 
and creating a mathematics continuum.  

 

* Professional development will be offered by District-support 
personnel, NTN Coach and School Leaders around Algebra for All. 
This work will be generalized to special needs students, English

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2018 Principal's Performance Review, school leaders must, "Continue enhancing instructional 
decisions that allow teachers to strategically provide multiple entry points in all lessons. You consistently provide 
supports and professional learning aimed at engaging students in challenging tasks which promote critical thinking, 
higher order thinking skills, and 
ownership of their learning."  

According to Summative End of Year conferencing and Danielson review, teachers need more time to share findings 
of Impact Teams vertically, and to include all stakeholders such as SETSS providers and ENL teachers.  

 

As a result, PS 11 will set and monitor a goal for the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

Areas of strength in this area include: 

1) Peer school visits to PS 50 and PS 23 around writing and math progressions. 

2) School Leaders consistently provided supports and professional learning aimed at engaging students in challenging 
tasks which promote critical thinking and student ownership. 

3) Teachers implemented these specific higher-ordered thinking activities into daily lessons. 

 

Priority needs in this area are: 

1) Schedule Monday Impact Team meetings for vertical shared data. Adjust curriculum plans, accordingly. 

2) Provide Administrative Feedback to Impact Teams via their Protocol and Advance Reporting.

● According to the school's 2018 Parent Learning Environment Survey, parents and guardians feel welcomed, they 
feel their children are safe at the school, and that their children are receiving rigorous instruction during the school 
day. They expressed that they want more enrichment programs after school. 

Strengths in this area include:  

● The school offered its first Choir to students in Grades 2-4. Bravo Broadway was the theme. Parents and families 
were thrilled with the level of rigor and excitement.  

* All enrichment (i.e.: art-based) instruction is multi-cultural, as well as sensitive to special needs and ENL populations.  

The one priority in this area is that parents and families want these types of after school programs across all grades. 

A goal will be set and monitored for the 2018-2019 school year around offering quality enrichment programs for 
students of all ages. This goal is directly aligned to the school's vision and mission of Educating the Whole Child.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 11, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Public School 11 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

At. P.S. 11 we plan on continuing our program entitled "Word Wizards," a Title III supplemental 
program before school. The materials we use for this program will only be used as part of our 
Title III program,  We currently service 54 English Language Learners which range from 
kindergarten to fifth grade.  Our "Word Wizards" program will be for the 2018 - 2019 and  2019 
- 2020 school years. The program will be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 
from  7:20 - 8:10a.m.  We will offer two sessions.  Session 1 will run for 16 weeks and will 
begin October 16, 2018 and service grades one and two.  Session 2 will run for 16 weeks and 
will service grades three through five beginning on February 12, 2019. Our Title III program will 
end on June 11, 2019. These dates are subject to change. Ms. Mattera, P.S. 11's principal, will 
supervise the morning on the selected days. Our ELLs NYSESLAT results, NYSITELL 
results and ongoing DRA reading assessments show that our students can benefit from a 
supplemental ENL program.  "Word Wizards" will show overall improvement for our ELLs in 
the areas of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Our NYSESLAT results show that a 
majority of our students need additional support in reading and writing.  "Word Wizards" will 
be an additional support in reading and writing for our ELLs.  
 
"Word Wizards" will be conducted in English. 
 
We plan on purchasing materials and supplies to create a literature/art curriculum.  Purchases 
will include art supplies and trade books which will include cultural books. Our literature/art 
curriculum will  provide and include graphic organizers and lesson plans.  Students will respond 
to the literature in a variety of ways.  We will focus on vocabulary as well.  This program will be 
multi-sensory.  Students will create art projects which will include holiday and culturally diverse 
work.  This may include creating masks, paintings, clay and tissue paper crafts. This will support 
students for the NYSESLAT in all areas including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.   At 
P.S. 11, one of our goals is to continue to improve student's exposure to new vocabulary and give 
students various strategies to figure out the meaning of unfamiliar words.  In addition, P.S. 11 
has a Raz-Kids account which is renewed yearly. Students will also use this program during 
"Word Wizards". This program will also support student's reading improvement.  For our 
newcomers, this program provides vivid pictures and stories which can be read to them while 
using headphones. Raz-Kids literature component with interactive books will used as the 
literature component of the lesson to be followed up with an art project.  At times, Raz-Kids and 
art activities will be intertwined.  There will also be times where the literature may come from 
trade books, read alouds, school book of the month and holiday/multi-cultural text.  The 
literature used will tie into the art activity. We also plan on purchasing leveled texts to support 
this program (about $850).  These new leveled texts  will be a great enhancement to our ENL 
program.  Students can use the texts to gain greater cross cultural understanding and for visuals 
through pictures. Students will also respond to videos that they watch on the internet to assist in 
their research. We believe that offering students the additional support with an emphasis on 
reading and writing will surely help our ELLs succeed. Grades 1-5 will be served using an

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
art/literature curriculum we create and Raz-Kids.  All proficiency levels will be served including: 
entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding.  The language of instruction will 
be English.  In terms of home language support, we will offer bilingual books and picture 
dictionaries.  Research has shown that children who participate in classroom art activities 
develop verbal skills that transfer to written and oral language.  When young children participate 
in the arts, they have the potential to improve both their text comprehension and their writing 
proficiency.  Communicating by creating and performing in the arts often enhances students' 
desire to read, write, and speak.  The arts can help students develop the essential understanding 
of the complexity of the English language.  Incorporating art will motivate and engage 
students.Through the use of technology ( Raz Kids,), literature (various text) and art we feel our 
program will help our ELLs progress through the proficiency levels.  We plan on spending about 
$750 on art supplies. Money will be allotted for up to two hours per month for planning time for 
the ESOL teacher.  The teacher will use this time to plan lessons, gather materials (such as art 
supplies), and look at the students' data to determine progress made.  Planning time will ensure 
that the teacher is adequately prepared to meet the student's needs. 
 
We feel this supplemental program is needed to improve student's overall achievement.  Our goal 
is to ultimately increase proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT exam.

P.S. 11 believes that professional development is key to the success of our Title III program. 
Teachers will engage in professional development throughout our program to be given by 
Patricia Perino ( certified ENL teacher).    
 
P.S. 11's ENL teacher also attends professional development throughout the year from the 
Borough Field office.  This information is always shared with the entire staff.  When classroom 
teachers attend ENL workshops, that information is shared as well with the P.S. 11 
community.  All teachers at P.S. 11 have the opportunity to attend professional development 
throughout the year which is provided by the Borough Field Office and Office of English 
Language Learners.  The ENL teacher provides information on an ongoing basis throughout the 
year. Patricia Perino who is a licensed ESOL teacher will provide ongoing professional 
development.  Professional Development opportunities will positively impact the progress of 
ELLs since all teachers are teachers of ELLs.  These Professional Developments are at no cost to 
the Title III LEP Funds.  Agendas and attendance sheets for the professional developments will 
be kept in a binder in the ENL room. PD will positively impact the progress of ELLs since the 
ESOL teacher along with all teachers at P.S. 11 will continue to learn various strategies and 
skills to implement with our ELLs.

Parent involvement is critical in students progression.  P.S. 11 engages the parents of ELLs in 
order to foster high achievement.  In working with parents, we continuously provide our students 
with support.  Professional development opportunities for parents are provided by the  Office of 
English Language Learners, community resources such as the College of Staten Island and our 
local libraries.  In addition, our parent coordinator and ENL teacher offer parent engagement 
activities as well.  The parent coordinator sends home flyers to our ELL parents in regards to 
Adult English classes at the College of Staten Island and our local libraries.  These flyers are 
translated into the parents native language.  As workshops and programs are available for our 
ELL families throughout the year from the district office, we will provide the families with this 
information.   
 
At P.S. 11 we offer many opportunities for parents to be involved with their child's education. 
 Some of these opportunities include (Dates are Tentative):

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
During our Title III program, we are going to invite parents to come see how our "Word 
Wizards" program supports their child academically.  Parents will have an opportunity to ask 
questions to the ENL teacher regarding these programs.  Students will be able to show their 
families how they are progressing.  The students will have the opportunity to share with their 
families their art projects and cultural experiences they have learned about.   
At P.S. 11, we feel parental involvement enhances our student's self-esteem and furthermore 
improves their academic achievement.  Patricia Perino  (ESOL) along with Karen Gubnitsky 
(parent coordinator) will run workshops for the parents. The ENL teacher will facilitate the Test 
Prep workshop with the parent coordinator.  Karen Gubnitsky (parent coordinator) keeps all 
agendas ,attendance sheets and invitations in parents' preferred language in a binder in her office 
at P.S. 11.  
 
 
Parents are notified of these activities through the school wide phone messaging system, notices 
sent home, school website, school calendar and the parent bulletin board.  Our school calendar is 
translated as well as other flyers sent home. The Translation and Interpretation Unit is used at 
parent's request. We also send home any information within our community that would help the 
parent in learning English to better prepare themselves to help their children at home.  For 
example, The Dongan Hills library and the JCC offer Adult Education courses to parents who 
speak languages other than English.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 11 uses DRA three times a year to assess early literacy skills. Students are tested during September/October, January and 
May/June.  DRA components include accuracy, fluency, comprehension and retelling.  This data drives instruction and is used 
to analyze student's strengths and weaknesses.  This data is also used to form groups for differentiation.  Our schools 
instructional focus is to deepen reading comprehension in ELA, math, science, social studies, and the arts through daily reading 
and writing activities.  The data shows how the ELL's reading levels are compared to English proficient students in their class 
and on each grade level. Teachers also use teacher created assessments, Go Math assessments and tracking sheets to assess 
student proficiency. This information helps inform our school's instructional planning by showing which subject and skills area 
needs reinforcement, are progressing satisfactorily, or need enrichment.  The results of the students' new assessment (DRA) 
will determine the teacher's plan of instruction.  DRA data is used to drive instruction, push academic language, build stamina 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

and lexile. For example, 2 out of 15 second grade ELLs are currently exceeding standard for reading levels.   Out of those 
2 ELL's, one student is a commanding proficiency level and the other student is at an expanding level. Seven ELL's are 
meeting the benchmark in reading, 2 ELLs are approaching and 4 ELLs are below grade level in reading. This data will help the 
ENL teacher as well as the classroom teacher to form differentiated groups and guided reading groups.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

During inquiry, teacher team meetings, faculty conferences and data team meetings all staff are presented with the findings of 
student DRA levels.  The staff discusses strategies that can be put in place or continued to assist all of our students in 
progressing along the reading levels.  Teachers update curriculum maps and  lesson plans to reflect student strengths and 
weaknesses.  This allows all teachers the opportunity to evaluate next steps for ELL's and all students at P.S. 11.  RTI is also a 
consideration for students who may be struggling whereas enrichment programs may be offered to students who are at or 
above the benchmark for reading.  We may also provide students who are not meeting standards with Academic Intervention 
Services. P.S. 11 also has a Title III program ("Word Wizards") for ELL's to join. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 We look at NYSESLAT scores as well as ELLs scores on the ELA, Math and Science state exams.  We look at the raw scores for 
each modality of the NYSESLAT and compare one year to the next.  We look for common trends to help us make future 
instructional plans. Students in kindergarten through second grade are administered the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) 
in the beginning of the year, mid-year and at the end of the year in ELA and Mathematics.  Teachers use this data to drive 
instruction, update curriculum maps and differentiate instruction.  Teachers were given an item skills analysis breakdown by 
grade for ELA and Math state exams.  Teachers use this data to begin the school year with.  This data enables teachers to align 
their lessons and maps accordingly. 
We use the School Quality Guide to look at closing the achievement gap among ELLs.  The 2013-2014 School Quality Guide 
shows ELLs had an 8.3% increase in closing the achievement gap.  We are meeting the target since our school results were 
50%.  The 2014-2015 school year results are 58.3  which shows we are right under the exceeding target of 59.0.   The 2015-
2016 school year results are 53.3% out of our 12.0% school population of ELLs.  The 2016-2017 School Quality Guide shows 
that 54.1% or lower of P.S.11 Ells are not meeting target, 54.2% to 63.3% are approaching target, 63.4% to 75.9% are meeting 
target and 76.0% or higher are exceeding target. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our teacher teams take part in inquiry cycles throughout the year with a specific focus in ELA or Math.  Through the inquiry 
process, we address common trends that students may need remediation in as well as those that may need enrichment.  For 
example, our school noticed that students had a deficit in basic phonics skills.  Administration provided many teachers with 
Orton Gillingham training where they received certification and now implement this approach into their classrooms. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Any ELL who scores below standards on the ELA is provided services to further support the student.  We take into 
consideration English and home language literacy, content area teacher recommendation, parent or guardian request, sample 
of student work in English and, if possible, in the home language and several other factors.  We use the MONDO program as a 
response to intervention program.  Students take an oral language assessment in the beginning of the school year and the data 
from that assessment helps the classroom teacher as well as the ENL group students and plan for instruction.  As one of our 
school goals is improving academic language the oral language component of MONDO will aid us in achieving this goal.  Great 
Leaps, Text Talk, RazKids, Flocabulary, Brainpop and Brainpop ESL are other programs that are being used during RTI and AIS 
for ELLs.  Orton-Gillingham is another approach to phonics and reading that we use with all students.  Our special education 
teachers, several classroom teachers and ENL teacher, Patricia Perino are all trained in this approach. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

Students who score proficient/commanding on the NYSITELL do well as English Language Learners throughout the grades in all 
subject areas.  If a kindergarten student is on a beginner/entering level on the NYSITELL it will take two years to be on level 
with his classmates.  If a beginner does well on the Spanish LAB, he may quickly learn English and might even test out in the 
spring of grade one.  Many students need to progress through the beginning/entering, low intermediate/emerging, 
intermediate/transitioning, advanced levels on the NYSESLAT before reaching proficient/commanding level.  Those students 
who do reach the proficient/commanding level will continue to receive ENL for 90 minutes for two years .  These students will 
be programmed in an alternative pathways program.  The options include: small-group learning, individualized targeted 
learning, project-based learning or a minimum of 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL.  If a student is on the 
advanced/expanding level, he can do as well as English proficient students in math and science.  Once an ELL reaches 
proficiency, he performs as Native English speakers in reading, math and science.  NYSESLAT data shows that 3 out of 24 ELLs 
who took the NYSESLAT in spring 2015 scored commanding.  13 out of 24 ELLs who took the NYSESLAT either improved or 
stayed at the same level.  This year we have had an influx of ELLs.  NYSITELL results data show we have 5 out of 12 students 
who are Entering, all which recently moved from their home country.  1 out of 12 new students who scored emerging, 1 out of 
12 students who scored transitioning, 5 out of 12 newcomers scored expanding.  Our newcomers are in different 
grades.  Classroom teachers and ENL teacher will use this data to drive instruction.  For example, newcomers who are entering 
will be exposed on a daily basis to visuals.  We use data from the RLAT to look at student progress. Results for the NYSESLAT in 
spring 2017 are as follows:  9 Commanding students, 29 Expanding students, 10 Transitioning students, 2 Emerging students 
and 2 Entering students.  This data will be updated in the fall when we receive the new data for NYSESLAT 2018. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have had an influx of ELL's and currently service 57 ELLs. A major adjustment to our ENL program has been the addition of 
a second full-time ELL teacher.  All teachers use the NYSESLAT results to drive data.  Teachers make adjustments to their 
curriculum maps and lesson plans based on these results.  For example, teachers may add in graphic organizers, vocabulary 
charts and additional visuals to their lessons and maps.  Many teachers were trained in Orton Gillingham which is used in the 
classroom as well as RTI.  The ENL teacher implements this approach as well. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All ELLs who are in the same grade are placed in the same class with exception for our ELLs in 12:1:1 
classes.  Beginner/Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA; Low 
Intermediate/Emerging ELLs receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA; 
Intermediate/Transitioning ELLs receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA; 
Advanced/Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  P.S. 11 has a 
heterogeneous mix of proficiency levels in one class.  Stand-alone English as a new language is an ENL delivery model 
in which students receive instruction in order to acquire the English language needed for success in core content 
courses.  A student cannot receive stand-alone English as a new language in lieu of core content area 
instruction.  Integrated ENL is an ENL delivery model in which students receive core content area (i.e., English 
language arts, math, science, or social studies) and English language development instruction from a dually certified 
teacher or two certified teachers.  Again, ELLs are grouped according to their grade (age) and are of mixed proficiency 
levels within the classroom and ENL classroom.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 We do not have a TBE program at this time. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We do not have a DL program at this time.  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

        An entering ENL student will receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL /ELA.  An 
Emerging ELL will receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  A transitioning ELL will 
receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  An expanding ELL will receive 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  A commanding ELL will receive an alternative pathways option which may include: 
small-group learning, individualized targeted learning, project-based learning or a minimum of 90 minutes per week of 
integrated ENL.  The ENL teacher provides standalone ENL minutes and integrated minutes.  Student programs can be found in 
STARS.  The school's administration ensures that ELLs receive the mandated number of instructional minutes according to 
proficiency levels.  The ENL teacher's program card also reflects the mandated number of instructional minutes for all 
ELLs.  We use page 37 of the ELL Policy and Reference Guide to be sure we are providing students with their mandated 
minutes.  We refer to the RLAT for student proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Reading, Math, Writing, Science and Social Studies are delivered in the ENL model.  Pictures, manipulatives, graphic 
organizers, listening program (Leap Frog) are some of the tools used to meet the standards.  Sets of National Geographic books 
and monthly magazines bring science and social studies to life as well as visuals and technology.  Students have access to 
dictionaries in English and in their home language.  We also have trade books in the students' home languages.  Learning takes 
place through teacher modeling, individually, with partners and within small groups.  ENL strategies and methodologies are 
employed and the Instructional Bottom Lines are met. Scaffolding is used by all teachers at P.S. 11 including classroom 
teachers, science teacher, social studies teacher and teachers of ELA and Math.  Instruction takes place in English.  We also 
foster a multi-sensory approach to teaching at P.S. 11.  The ENL teacher and several other teachers were trained in Orton 
Gillingham in  November 2015.  Our school uses a variety of programs which foster language development and meet the 
demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  Some of the programs we use are:  ReadyGen, GO Math, Mondo, Great 
Leaps, Text Talk, Wilson , and Raz Kids.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language.  Each parent receives the HLIS survey in their native language.  If 
there is a need, the Translation and Interpretation Unit is contacted for assistance.  The School Based Support Team also 
ensures that students are evaluated in their home language throughout the year.   Our testing coordinator ensures ELLs and 
former ELLs receive a copy of the Math state test in their home language.   If the state exam does not come in the student's 
native language they are provided a glossary in their native language.   ELLs in K-2 will also be given a copy of the MOSL in their 
home language.  We are considering using screeners in the future as well.  Possibly a paraprofessional who speaks the 
student's native language would be used as a screener.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We do not have any SIFE students at this time.  When a newcomer enters our school, he is placed on grade level and seated 
next to a classmate who speaks the same language if possible.  In ENL class, a newcomer will be grouped with students on his 
grade and the ENL teacher will differentiate instruction for the newcomer as well as the other students.  The newcomer is

taught skills and strategies to help him understand and develop language and prepare the student for the ELA test.  Most ELLs 
who have received services from 4- 6 years have developed their listening and speaking skills.  They are usually delayed in 
reading and have difficulty with writing.  Reading and writing skills are practiced daily.  Vocabulary is stressed during every 
academic lesson and activity.  We do not have any long term ELLs.  Former ELLs will receive an alternative pathway to support 
their academic progress for two years after they score proficient/commanding on the NYSESLAT.  The commanding ELLs also 
receive accomodations such as time and a half on state exams for two years.  Long Term ELLs are ELLs who have received 
English as a new language instruction, as a component of their bilingual education or freestanding English as a new language 
program, for 7 or more continuously enrolled school years in the United States.  Long Term ELLs instruction is differentiated to 
fit their academic  needs with a focus on developing academic language.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All of the teachers at P.S. 11 have access to the MONDO program which consists of oral language and guided reading sets.  The 
students work individually, in pairs, in small groups and whole groups when it is educationally beneficial.  Oral language is 
always encouraged and meaningful discussion using academic language is a priority in every classroom.  Books on each child's 
reading level are employed.  This includes many non-fiction books that teach our students social studies and science.  National 
geographic books and magazines are used to expose our students to social studies and science. P.S. 11 also purchased Raz KIds 
accounts which our ENL students use.  Math is taught using manipulatives.  Scaffolding and ENL methodologies are always 
employed.  All classroom teachers and all service providers read the IEP's of their children.  The ENL teacher reads the IEP's of 
her students so she can provide appropriate instruction.  Most of our special education teachers have been trained on Orton 
Gillingham and Wilson which they use during instructional time. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our curricular and instructional flexibility helps us meet the needs of our ELLs.  Although it is based on the Common Core 
Standards, we remediate and enrich to meet our student's needs.  Background knowledge is discussed at the beginning of all 
lessons to make connections with the students.  Grouping of students is flexible according to many factors including 
proficiency levels and grade levels.  All students in P.S. 11 are placed in the least restrictive environment.  ELLs in self-
contained special education classes are mainstreamed for reading and/or math and/or writing whenever possible.  They are 
also mainstreamed for gym.  They attend special events and classes that take place during and after the school day with the 
general population.  ENL students are placed by grade regardless of their disability.  ELL-SWDs teachers are aware of IEP goals 
and work collaboratively through teacher teams and inquiry to modify instruction/curriculum.  The ENL teacher models 
strategies for the ICT teachers to use during their instruction. All ELLs may attend our Title III program entitled, "Word 
Wizards." 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All ELLs participate in RTI (Response To Intervention)  each day.  Newcomers learn basic language skills.  Other proficiency 
levels have enrichment activities such as cooking and art/literacy.  Some of the intervention services P.S. 11 offers are:  Text 
Talk, MONDO, Raz Kids, Flocabulary, and Great Leaps.    These programs are offered in English.  We target ELLs who are below 
reading level according to DRA data.  P.S. 11 has an AIS math specialist on staff who takes small groups to work on the students 
weaknesses.  ELLs take part in this program.  P.S. 11 also offers Parents as Arts Partners where parent and child can work on an 
art project together.  P.S. 11 also offers programs in ELA and Math after school. We also offer STEM and PATH through the 
YMCA after school.  P.S. 11 also offered a Title III program this school year ("Word Wizards") where Ells can take part in. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 We will be following mandates for the new ENL programming.   Our school will continue to use READYGEN, Go Math, DRA , 
Mondo and Raz Kids.  Classroom teachers will continue to use their units of study (curriculum maps). For the 2016-2017 school 
year, P.S. 11 incorporated the Sanford Harmony program into the classroom. We will continue to use Sanford Harmony for the 
2018 - 2019 school year.  We are going to implement TEAM (Teaching Ells for Academic Language Mastery) which is published 
by Continental for our Ells. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
There are no ENL programs/ services being discontinued this year.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  When a notice is sent home for any extra programs within the school 
all students receive the notice.    Blackboard phone messaging is also used to inform parents of school programs being 
offered.  Blackboard phone messaging will give the parent the message in their home language ( what is listed in 
ATS).  Students then return the notice to school if they wish to join the program. The parent coordinator (Karen Gubnitsky) also 
has notices translated in the preferred language of the parent.   Enrollment is on a first come basis.  Several programs being 
offered this year so far are hip hop dance, tap dance, PATH, STEM, after school sports and book club.  We also provide a Title III 
program entitled, "Word Wizards" where ELLs in grades 1-5 may attend.  This program is offered on Tuesday, Wednesday and 
Thursday mornings from 7:30- 8:10. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 The newcomers are provided with phonics based programs such as Explode the Code.  Many sets of social studies and science 
books are used, including National Geographic, on all levels.  The National Geographic magazine is used on a monthly 
basis.  National Geographic science kits are provided to integrate literacy and science.  The children improve their listening 
skills with the support of the Leap Frog program.  Many manipulatives are available to support the ENL program for students in 
grades K-5.  There is a smartboard in the ENL classroom which is used on a daily basis. Technology used to support  ELLs 
include: smartboard, leapfrog videos, books on tape, raz kids, starfall website, brain pop website, music (phonics songs), and 
LeapPad Learning System.  ELLs are also exposed to ReadyGen, GO Math (English and Spanish), Sadlier Phonics, Vocabulary 
Workbooks, NYSESLAT test prep books , and Mondo. Our science teachers uses FOSS.  Our Social Studies teacher follows New 
York State Social Studies Scope and Sequence to plan her instruction. Our art teacher uses the blueprint for the Arts.  We were 
also fortunate enough to purchase ipads through our Title III funding which students use for research, visuals, etc. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in our ENL program through the use of reading books and various language 
glossaries.  The Translation Unit is used if necessary.  The ENL program provides students with a minimum of 25% of learning in 
their home language.  The ENL classroom has a multi-cultural library and dictionaries in students home language.  Dictionaries 
in ELLs home languages are in all classrooms. Our curriculum maps list supports for ELLs.  The ENL teacher models strategies 
for classroom teachers.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The support services correspond to the ELLs at all ages and in all grades.  Teaching is based on the Common Core Standards 
and is coordinated with the classroom teacher.   The ENL teacher meets with administration to review programming.  Time is 
allotted for co-planning on a regular basis at P.S. 11.  All teachers collaborate and share through teacher teams and 
inquiry.  ELLs are grouped according to their grade level (age).  The ENL teacher may service students in two consecutive 
grades simultaneously (i.e. grades 1 and 2  or grades 4 and 5). 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 P.S. 11 does not share a building. The newcomers are provided with phonics based programs such as Explode the Code.  Many 
sets of social studies and science books are used, including National Geographic, on all levels.  The National Geographic 
magazine is used on a monthly basis.  National Geographic science kits are provided to integrate literacy and science.  The 
children improve their listening skills with the support of the Leap Frog program.  Many manipulatives are available to support 
the ENL program for students in grades K-5.  There is a smartboard in the ENL classroom which is used on a daily basis. 
Technology used to support  ELLs include: smartboard, leapfrog videos, books on tape, raz kids, starfall website, brain pop 
website, music (phonics songs), and LeapPad Learning System.  ELLs are also exposed to ReadyGen, GO Math (English and 
Spanish), Sadlier Phonics, Vocabulary Workbooks, NYSESLAT test prep books , and Mondo. Our science teachers uses

FOSS.  Our Social Studies teacher follows New York State Social Studies Scope and Sequence to plan her instruction. Our art 
teacher uses the blueprint for the Arts.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our Pre-K flyer is translated in a variety of languages.  P.S. 11 offers a Pre-K showcase where new parents can meet the 
teachers, visit the classroom, and take part in a question and answer session.  In the spring each year, P.S. 11 offers a Meet and 
Greet of the entire school where any parent can attend.  Parents and students take a tour of P.S. 11 at this time.  We are 
hoping to implement a program where newly enrolled ELLs come in before the beginning of the school year to participate in a 
fun activity. Throughout the year ELLs take part in Kindergarten/Fifth grade Buddies, special assemblies and Writer's 
Celebrations.  The ENL teacher, classroom teacher of ELLs and the parent coordinator are involved in these activities.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
Language electives are not offered at P.S. 11.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program at this time.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher is provided with ELL professional development through district 31 and the OELL. The ENL teacher also 
frequently checks the monthly calendar of professional development being offered through the borough field office. The ENL 
teacher also takes part in out of school visitation.  The ENL teacher models lessons for teachers of ELLs throughout the school 
year.  The ENL teacher is given time to talk at faculty conferences and during professional development time on Monday 
afternoons and during Inquiry time on Tuesday afternoons where the ENL teacher provides information regarding updates and 
changes.  Our school secretary and parent coordinator also attend workshops related to ELLs. The ENL teacher took part in 
professional development on October 17, 2016 where guided reading was the topic.  Again, on October 31, 2016 for 
"Analyzing Running Records Using Miscue Analysis"; December 16, 2016 for "Reflective Practice Teaching"; March 27, 2017 for 
"De-Escalation Techniques"; April 3, 2017 for NYSESLAT training and June 7, 2017 for LAP training. The ENL teacher provided 
workshops for staff on May 7 and 14, 2018 regarding ELL policy, procedures and strategies.  The ENL teacher received a 
Mentoring certification for completing the 12 hour course on June 4 and 5 2018.  All Professional development is turn-keyed to 
all staff including classroom teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors and service providers. 
The ENL teacher consults the DOE website and the Borought Field Support Center website for upcoming professional 
developments and the principal sends e-mails to the ENL teacher and all staff regarding any professional development being 
offered in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.  All professional developments are 
common core aligned.   All professional development will be shared with all staff.  All teachers take part in professional 
development on Monday afternoons.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As ELLs transition from elementary to middle school, students are given a middle school guide (translations provided by the 
DOE website), scheduled visits for students to I.S. 2 and I.S. 2 visiting P.S. 11.  Translation services are always provided if 
needed.   Our guidance counselor assists all students including ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school.  All 
professional development that is attended by the ENL teacher is turn-keyed to our guidance counselor.  Our guidance 
counselor  is split between P.S. 11 and P.S. 1.   
Agendas from professional development are kept in binders for all of the staff at P.S. 11.  The administration also has a file 
with all of our teachers professional developments attended and professional development plans.  A minimum of 15% of the 
required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 is dedicated to language acquisition in 
alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating 
language and content instruction for English language learners.  The ENL teacher receives ELL-specific professional 
development through the DOE.   Our school secretary, Catherine Howe keeps logs on all professional developments attended 
by all staff.  For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a minimum of 50% of the required professional 
development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with common core content area instruction, 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
language learners.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school provides annual individual meeting with parents of ELLs on Tuesday afternoons with the ENL teacher during parent 
engagement time.  These meetings are on an individual basis.  The ENL teacher discusses with the parent/guardian the goals of 
the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results and the language development needs 
in all content areas.  A translator is provided if necessary or at a parent's request.   

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At P.S. 11 parents are welcomed  and encouraged to become active partners in their child's academic, emotional and social 
growth.  Karen Gubnitsky,  the parent coordinator, is available to provide outreach to parents and guardians through 
newsletters, monthly calendars, the school website, and other literature.  The DOE translation unit is utilized for documents, 
literature, notices and phone translations as well as Big Words.  The parent coordinator works collaboratively with all 
administration, teachers, student support personnel, and staff to engage and educate our families in order for them to support 
their child's academic needs on a daily basis.  The entire school community supports our ELL parents.  The Council on Arts and 
Humanities (COAHSI) and Sundog Theaters partner with the school for an after school Newspaper Club.  The Huttner-
Pasqualini Post fosters patriotism and helps build school spirit throughout the year at special assemblies.  Parents also take 
part in Parents as Learning Partners, special assemblies, Parents As Art Partners and Writer's Celebrations throughout the 
school year.  All classroom teachers are aware of the translation services that the DOE provides.  Classroom teachers, ENL 
teacher and other staff members use translation services such as the Translation and Interpretation unit and Big Words for 
oral or written translations.  ELL parents are offered specific trainings throughout the year such as:  IEP, helping your child get 
ready for the NYSESLAT, dial a teacher,  ENL strategies parents can use to help their child (we provide graphic organizers and 
sample questions parents can use to help their child with comprehension).  Parents are also invited to attend our Title III 
celebrations where students have a chance to show off their accomplishments.   
  
Mrs. Perino, the ENL teacher will meet individually with the parents or guardians of English Language Learners at least once a 
year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled 
meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, 
their child's English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  This 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

additional meeting should include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's 
language development in all content areas in English and in the child's home language in the case of students enrolled in a 
bilingual education program.  Such meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of 
communication the parent or guardian best understands.  Schools must determine the manner and form of such individual 
parent meetings, in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.  Schools should record attendance using existing 
procedures.   These meetings will be held on Tuesday afternoons during the parent engagement time.  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Erica Mattera, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 11 assesses language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication through 
the use of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), specifically Part III. Part III of the HLIS asks the parents 
to respond to two questions about the parents preferred language for communication. The two questions are as 
follows: In what language would you like to receive written information from the school? and In what language 
would you prefer to communicate orally with school staff? We also use emergency contact cards which asks the 
parent which language they prefer to be contacted in for both written and oral communication. The ENL teacher 
also sends home a notice to parents asking which language parents prefer to be contacted in for both written and 
oral communication. We also use the Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) to assess the language preference 
of the parent community for both written and oral communication. We monitor the RAPL quarterly for new 
admits, changes, discharges and other updates.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school's communication strategy to reach limited-Engllsh-proficient families in the event of a school emergency is 
to use the Language Line or available bi-lingual staff members for translation. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school's LAC informs all staff members of the goals of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and the resources that are 
available to meet compliance. Our school's LAC turnkeys this information to staff members several times throughout 
the year including staff development days, parent engagement time and faculty conferences. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any:

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

Translators available (both in house and through the language and translation unit) at Parent Teacher Conferences, 
IEP meetings and any other face-to-face interactions. DOE translations service as requested by parents. Parents are 
informed of their rights at the ENL Orientation meeting. They are given the options to choose the program they prefer 
to enroll their children in. The Parents' Bill of Rights is sent home to all parents in our school. Staff members have 
been given a Language ID Guide. A copy of the translation and interpretation brochure and language ID Guide can also 
be found in the main office, School Safety Agent desk, bulletin board that is displayed upon entrance of the school, 
and in the staff room. The ENL teacher also has the information posted in the ENL classroom. Parents are provided 
with the Parents Guide to Language Access within the Parent handbook packet. P.S. 11 staff will use the Language Line 
, Big Word deemed necessary or at a parent/guardian request. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We gather feedback from the parent survey. Every parent/guardian of an ELL completes the parent survey. The ENL 
teacher provides parents/guardians the survey in English and in the parents preferred language. Parents have an 
opportunity to attend Parent Orientation in September where they can ask questions and fill out the parent survey. 
Any parent who does not complete the parent survey receives a phone call home from the ENL teacher or parent 
coordinator. We would also try to have the parent fill out the parent survey when the bring their child to school in the 
morning or in the afternoon when the child is picked up. Parent surveys are kept on file in a binder in the ENL 
teacher's room. We use the RAPL, the HLIS, face-to-face interview with the parents to gather feedback to improve 
language services. We have staff members who speak various languages who help us translate and interpret to meet 
the needs of our families. We use the translation and interpretation unit, Big Words and the NYCDOE website as well.
