Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We continually co-create a community filled with intellectual curiosity, high engagement, laughter, and camaraderie. 
Our students experience academic success in all forms, high expectations in the classrooms, excitement for learning, 
and positive peer support. As a result of these experiences, our students manifest a greater purpose for their lives and 
their communities and embody courage and compassion 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

We are caring, thoughtful, role models who are equipped in youth development and social justice theory, to support 
our students in achieving these goals and meeting these expectations.  

Our theory of action historically is centered on the systems and strategies regarding how older adolescents with a 
history of truancy learn best. This includes streamlining information and supporting the families and parents of our 
students. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
West Brooklyn Community High School is a progressive, transfer high school located in Borough Park, Brooklyn. West 
Brooklyn was developed and envisioned by a collaborative committee formed in October 2005, comprised of parents, 
alternative public school alumni, high school teachers, administrators, and representatives from what would become 
our primary partnership community organization-- Good Shepherd Services (GSS). In January 2006, the proposal for 
this alternative school was approved by the New Schools Development Team, hiring and student recruitment began, 
and a school building was found. West Brooklyn opened its doors in September 2006 and continues to this day to hold 
its mission of providing high quality, rigorous, and engaging instruction to overage, under credited high school 
students as well as socio-emotional support and resources in order to support our students in earning a high school 
diploma. For many of our students, due to a myriad of reasons and circumstances, a high school diploma was no 
longer feasible in their prior academic setting. 

WB is a partnership between the DOE and GSS. We are a community of educators working together collaboratively to 
provide quality instruction and social emotional support to our students in order to prepare them for high school 
graduation, and, ultimately, for college and/or career. 

West Brooklyn Community High School, a partnership school, will provide an accelerated, rigorous learning 
environment where overage, under-credited young people with a history or truancy, their families, and staff feel safe. 
Young people recommit to improve their attendance, accumulate credits, develop a life after West Brooklyn plan, and 
graduate with concrete next steps. 

Our theory of action under-girding this year’s work and CEP goals is that regular cycles of observation and feedback to 
both teachers and students will drive standards-based growth in key areas of performance as measured by Advance 
and MoSLs. Through continued instructional coaching of teachers, inter-visitations, lesson studies and lesson debrief 
discussions as facilitated through our participation in the Learning Partners Program as well as the development of 
academic behaviors of students in most classes through the use of tools to help students self-monitor authentic 
engagement and develop “grit” and a “growth mindset”, both students and teachers will develop their capacity for 
self-directed learning and growth utilizing the resources and supports available to them within the context of the 
extended school community. 

 

in 2017-2018 we introduced Professional Learning Communities for our teaching team. Through this initiative we 
have made significant changes to our grading policy and have moved our focus on racial equity into our theory of 
action.  

 

Our partnership with Good Shepherd Services partner provides every parent or guardian with a primary person that 
they can rely on for updates about their child’s progress. The advocate counselors also support in their child to 
develop new habits for academic success. We have seven advocate counselors, each with a caseload of about 33 
students. They provide socio-emotional, attendance, academic, and post-secondary support and counseling to their 
students. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

This year we are continuing our work in developing a Life after West Brooklyn (LaWB) student portfolio and provide 
our students with post-secondary counseling, seminars, and trips. New partnerships include relationships with 
Groundswell, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and the BAM Brooklyn Reads Project. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school is designed to serve overage, under-credited high school students; with the intent to help the students 
graduate with their 6th, 7th, or 8th year cohort.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

West Brooklyn’s strengths include our collaboration and partnership with Good Shepherds Services as well as our 
commitment to developing teacher leadership and student voice. Our accomplishments include, but are not limited 
to: raising over $3,000 to benefit our graduating seniors through the Zishan Rafi Memorial Scholarship, the strength of 
our teacher-lead departments, our teacher-artist enriched elective program, our unified curriculum, and our teacher-
developed common assessment system. 

Our challenges include: increasing our attendance rate as well as creating standardized approaches towards 
supporting students who are chronically absent in meeting learning standards, to continue to innovate our current 
methods for credit accumulation, and to prepare our students for college and career. Each of these challenges are 
addressed in our school wide goals for 2015-2016 and are a part of our three-year school plan. 

In the feedback shared through the PPO visits and our Quality Review from 2016-2017 we identified that Pedagogy is 
our key area of growth. As a result we have identify various ways to enhance the learning in the classroom . 
Additionally, we continue to improve our system for College and Career readiness, we only earned a 33% in how many 
students successfully completed an approved college or career preparatory course or assessment. As we continue to 
implement AP courses, we hope to positively impact this metric.  

We have made significant growth in our LaWB work as we have mapped out all our courses, programs, interventions, 
and experiences that prepare students for the workforce or higher education, and aligned them to our mission and 
vision statement. In the prior year we received low marks on our progress report in College and Career Readiness 
category, we responded by applying for College Preparatory Course Certification (CPCC) and qualifying for our 
Forensic courses. As a result, students have an opportunity to engage in rigorous curricula that prepares them for 
college level work. The key area of focus continues to be the post-secondary preparation of our students. An integral 
team to move that work forward is the LaWB committee which is comprised of Advocate Counselors, Teachers, 
Administrators, our College Access Counselor, our Learning to Work Coordinator and Guidance Counselor. Over the 
past three years, our LaWB committee has developed an annual retreat for all staff, where we continue to envision 
who we want our graduates to be and what we need to do to get them there. This year we are participating in the AP

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
For the past two years, one strength about our school has been that all of the teachers at West Brooklyn Community 
High school have been rated overall Effective and Highly Effective according to their combined MOTP and MOSL 
scores. Of our 16 teachers, only 3 were rated Developing for their instructional practice with the rest receiving 
Effective and Highly Effective scores in Advance. Despite the relative efficacy of our teachers instructionally, a 
weakness of the school has been that student performance and impressions seemingly don't match our expectations 
based on the quality of teacher practice. Credit accumulation among students is at an average of 50% over the course 
of the year and scholarship rates for most courses is equally low. While teachers earned approximate 80% favorable 
marks on Pedagogical Effectiveness, Rigorous Expectations and Classroom Climate and Teacher-Student Relationships 
according to our most recent Student Perceptions Survey, they earned on average only 60% favorable marks on 
Classroom Engagement. We believe that students learn best in engaging classrooms with clearly defined goals and 
necessary supports and scaffolds to help all students succeed. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 80% (approximately 13 of 16) teachers will receive overall Effective or Highly Effective ratings on 
component 3C: Engagement in Advance. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Regular and targeted observational rounds by Principal; through 
these observations special emphasis will be placed on our 
various subgroups: ELLs, SWDs, and OAUC students. In the post-
observation conversations every teacher will receive specific 
feedback on how to best meet the needs of each subgroup and 
general noticings from the aggregate observational data at the 
end of each round. 

First round of PLC inquiry work around component 3C framed 
around the question, "What practices are teachers using to 
impact student engagement?" Through the course of their cycle-
long inquiry, PLC members will explore student data, look at 
student work, conduct intervisitations and talk to teachers and 
students. This first round of PLC inquiry will culminate at the end 
of the cycle with a presentation by each group of strategies 
observed of introduced to increase student engagement.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Over the course of the year, there will be three two-week-long rounds of observations from which the overall ratings 
of teachers will be compared against the goal and the progress towards the goal in the previous round of 
observations. Each round will be followed by a sharing of best practices seen during the observations and some 
general highs and lows observed in various classrooms. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
We will primarily use Advance data to assess our progress and completion of this goal. We will also reference Student 
Perception Surveys to triangulate our perception and expectations about student engagement against student 
perceptions. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Last year, the S-cohort attendance rate at West Brooklyn Community High School was 68.3%. This represents a slide 
from 71% the previous year and 76.5% the year before that. We recognize that attendance and credit accumulation 
go hand-in-hand. Students that don't regularly attend classes often don't develop the skills necessary to pass. 
Historically, many of our students start strong at WBCHS and trail off as they approach their final year. To meet our 
graduation targets, we have set increasing the attendance rate for our graduating seniors for this year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will maintain a 72% yearly average attendance for our S-cohort students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Collaboration is a strong area of our academic program as evidenced by our learning environment survey results, 
internal staff survey data, and the feedback staff give at the end of every staff meeting. There are various formal 
opportunities for staff to collaborate on a daily, weekly, and per cycle basis. These opportunities include daily 
common planning time for teachers, weekly department meetings, weekly case conferencing, a structure that allows 
teachers and counselors to make appointments with each other to discuss their students; as well as collaborative 
planning jams which occur every cycle. 

 
That being said, at several points and in many ways throughout the year, teachers have expressed an eagerness and 
willingness to conduct more peer observations and inter-visitations of their colleague’s practice to develop a more 
robust arsenal of pedagogical strategies. To that end, teachers will be supported and encouraged to participate in 
inter-visitations with their colleagues this year. Last year, of the 16 teachers at WBCHS, five, received “highly 
effective” MOTP ratings in Advance. This represents a pool of talent and expertise we intend to leverage to improve 
the instruction of our staff across the board. 

This year, building on last year’s work to support increased collaboration and intervisitations, we will use our 
Department Facilitator structure to support intervisitations—as well as support our highly effective teachers in 
opening their classrooms to their colleagues. Based on the 2015-2016 student Tripod survey students favorably rated 
the rigorous expectations (82%) held by their teachers as well as the Pedagogical Effectiveness (81%); however 
teachers have continued to express a desire to work thoughtfully together. 

We have also restructured our Professional Development schedule to allow for more interdepartmental work in the 
form of teacher-led PLCs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

By October 2018 the principal will conduct an instructional 
round with each Department Facilitator; the purpose of these 
instructional rounds are to examine the class ethos through the 
lens of our subgroups: ELLs, SWDs, and OAUC students.  

Starting November 2018, at least once each cycle, teachers will 
either lead/host or participate in a lab site or inter-visitation of a 
colleague’s practice and debrief with them afterwards about 
what they learned to develop their own practice in a pre-
identified area of need with special emphasis on our various 
subgroups: ELLs, SWDs, and OAUC students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a first year Principal of West Brooklyn Community High School, having served for 3 years as the AP, I know a great 
deal about the schools strengths and areas for growth and have some early ideas about things I want to change. With 
the change in leadership come the opportunity for a change in vision, mission and approach. What we do well, as 
assessed in Quality Reviews, Student Perception Surveys and anecdotal after every visit, is establish a positive culture 
and learning environment. What we want to improve is the rigor of classwork and the quality of instruction. When 
asked, staff identify these as our areas of celebration and focus as well. Staff have a clear sense of their practice and 
their expectations but perhaps not the shared expectation and we have as a school. As Princiapl, it is my responsibility 
to help staff develop and articulate a clear vision and mission for this school that will shape every aspect of their 
practice and serve as a touchstone from which they can assess the efficacy of their work towards our chared goals. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers (100%) all members of the school community will share in the schools vision and mission and 
be able to articulate school-wide goals relative to the role they play in the school.

100% of teachers will engage in an Initial Planning Conference 
where they review their data for 2017-2018, their goal for the 
2018-2019 academic year, make their observation option choice, 
and receive feedback on their goal(s). This meeting is grounded 
in meeting the needs of our various subgroups: ELLs, SWDs, and 
OAUC students as well as strategies for our students to engage 
our parents and community members.  

 

Departments will create a SMART goal for their department work 
for the 2018-2019 academic year which is aligned with the 
Instructional Focus for the year; goals will be reviewed for their 
impact on our subgroups: ELLs, SWDs, and OAUC students as 
well as incorporating parents and families of our students. 

100% of staff members will participate in a full-day in-service PD 
where we will unpack our beliefs about the school and 
brainstorm a new mission and vision for the school. 

Mid-year and end-of-year conversations will be had with each 
teachers to reflect on their initial goals, their progress towards 
those goals, the impact on our subgroups and work over the 
course of the year towards the goal.

Parents and Families are at the heart of our work and we take our responsibility towards them seriously. Through our 
partnership with Good Shepherd Services we provide follow up and support to our parents and families that they had 
not experienced in their child’s former high school. According to the learning environment survey 97% of our parents 
and families felt that West Brooklyn kept them informed about what their child is learning. And 100% of parents and 
families felt that we make them feel welcomed. This is the type of feedback that confirms that our partnership and 
collaborative approach is successful. 

The purpose of this goal is to move the 5% of our parents who feel that West Brooklyn is not giving their child 
meaningful assignments that help them learn by enriching and broadening the experiences that parents and families 
have with our academic staff by having less than 2% of parents and families who feel this way.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

There are several things that we do in order to attract HQT and maintain HQT, such as: 

1. Rigorous Multi-Tiered Hiring Process (Recruitment): Our hiring process includes various steps in order to attract and 
maintain HQTs. We begin with attending diverse job fairs, posting on Idealist, and emailing our job posting to various 
lists serves. From there we invite potential candidates to an Open House where they are able to interact with DOE 
staff, GSS staff, and students. The participants are able to engage in conversation about the youth development 
principles and pedagogy. 

From the Open House we invite select candidates to interview. The interview includes: a classroom observation, a 
mock lesson with post-observation, a group interview with the committee, and a writing sample. 

From this process we have been able to hire exceptional candidates that believe in our mission. 

2. Detailed Job Posting (Recruitment): Our job posting delineates what a teacher needs to have in order to meet our 
expectations. 

3. Specific attendance PD for all staff (Support): During our full staff retreat in August, we present the year’s 
attendance goal and allow teachers to develop their individual plans in order to support the larger goal (a 3% school 
wide increase). We will continue this work through monthly onsite all-staff PDs. The administrative team coordinates 
and facilitates the all-staff PDs and attendance is a consistent area to return to and revisit as a team. 

4. Instructional Support Specialist (Support): New teachers receive specific one-on-one support through our lead 
teacher. The ISS person meets with new teachers biweekly and on a one-to-one basis as needed. 

5. Frequent Observations (Support): The principal and assistant principal observe every teacher each term (cycle). 
During these observations attendance interventions and strategies are addressed individually and addressed in the 
post-observation. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

6. Teacher Leadership (Support and Retention): We have developed a position to be filled internally regarding 
Powerschools. We have a teacher leader who is able to train their peers, teaching artists, and will have a role in 
developing the trainings for families and parents. We have identified additional funding in order to compensate this 
teacher for their time and additional training. Our teacher leadership position allow teacher to receive targeted 
support and leadership opportunities in area of interest: technology, new teacher development, data, student voice 
and leadership, and curriculum development. 

7. Collaboration between DOE and GSS (Support): Our Department of Education staff work in collaboration with Good 
Shepherd Services. The College Access Counselor works closely with the Guidance Counselor in order to support each 
student’s development. Other staff members are kept up to date with frequent college and careers announcements 
via an electronic newsletter and during monthly meetings. 

8. Teacher Assignments are determined by the teacher's license area and interest. Administrators work individually 
with teachers to develop curriculum and support their practice.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Department Meetings: Teachers meet monthly with their department in order to review curriculum and the 
department’s progress towards developed a strongly aligned New Generation Learning Standards curriculum.  

Monthly Professional Development Sessions: Once a month every teacher meets in order to review the school wide 
goal of aligning to New Generation Learning Standards , in department teams and mixed groups, the teachers 
engaged in the new standards and receive feedback on their progress. The superintendent's office has created a 
platform of professional development opportunities for the Assistant Principal, while the Principal is engaging in 
learning sessions through the Office of Leadership. All members of the learning community engage in building-wide 
professional development.  

Instructional Support Specialists: We use various teacher leadership positions in order to build capacity at the school 
level. One of these positions is the ISS role, which is shared this year by two ELA teachers. They engage in peer 
observations and literacy work with teachers.  

Peer Observations: In addition to the peer observations that the ISS team conducts, departments also have a peer 
observation protocol built into their meeting structure.

regularly with the Principal, PLC Facilitators, and staff PDs with dedicated opportunities for teacher feedback. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. West Brooklyn Community High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.

 

providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, 
communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school 
community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including 
parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation 
of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The 
findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs 
of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 
In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed 
Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement 
and school quality, the school will: 

 

 

 

 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program 
as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent 
Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree upon the use of 
these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents to effectively support their child’s 
learning. 

engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the 
school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in 
the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association 
(or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing 
professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent 
Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children 
who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent 
Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central 
office.; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability grade-level 
curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology training to build 
parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment 
Survey Report; 

host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise parents of children 
participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and 
the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, 
to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to 
provide suggestions; 

translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that 
address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

school in relation to students.  

● Parents and families are invited to classroom exhibitions at the end of the cycle where students demonstrate what 
they’ve learned in various courses.  

 

Our school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

I. School Responsibilities: Providing General Support to Parents 

● Advocate Counselor and the Primary Person Model : The advocate counselor acts as the primary person responsible 
for working with and monitoring students regarding their academic progress toward earning a high school diploma. In 
addition to being the “go-to” person for the students’ questions, concerns, and issues, the AC is responsible for 
conducting individual meetings every two weeks, facilitating advisory class (Community Leaders), doing attendance 
outreach, engaging the parents, programming students for courses tracking their graduation progress, goal setting, 
crisis intervention, and referring students for outside supports, as needed. 

We operate with the notion that the AC is the sole, primary, staff person responsible for coordinating communication 
with all stakeholders regarding the student including the principal and school leadership, the family, teachers, college 
and career staff, etc. Regarding family engagement, each AC calls home on a regular basis to maintain good 
communication with the parent/guardian. In addition to reviewing each Benchmark report card, the AC calls home 
when students are late / absent. The AC also schedules a Family Meeting when academic, attendance, or behavior 
issues emerge. The AC also meets with the parent during Open School Days, once per cycle, and new this year at our 
scheduled Family & Community meeting, also once per cycle. 

● Consistent and Targeted Attendance Outreach : As the primary person for parents and families, ACs have an 
important role in monitoring daily attendance. Each morning, the ACs position themselves at the school’s entrance to 
greet students, check-in briefly as needed, and sign-in students as present to school. This process begins at 8:45 AM, 
fifteen minutes before classes begin at 9:00 AM. The ACs remain at this location to address students who are present, 
but arrive late. At approximately 9:20 AM, the ACs begin their Attendance Outreach calls to locate each absent 
student and notify the parent of the absence. Students are reminded of how critical each day is, and directed to come 
to school if they find that the student is still at home. In addition, ACs conduct a home visit to transport students to 
school for students who are absent for two days straight without having made contact or an explanation as to their 
absence. 

● Monthly Parent Association Meetings : Each month parents and families are invited to West Brooklyn’s Parent 
Association. The PA is run by a committee of parents and the parent coordinator. As a team they set the monthly 
agendas and invite different speakers and guests to each meeting. Topics have included: the college application 
process, applying for federal financial aid, understanding our benchmark structure, and strategies for communicating 
with adolescents.  

● Student and Parent Commitment Letter: During the intake process, the AC, student, and parent review and discuss 
our commitment letter. The student is directed to reflect on the letter between the first and second meeting, and 
then to articulate their commitment to West Brooklyn, while the AC explains our commitment to the student and 
parent. Highlights of this discussion are that WB is a community created and maintained by staff, students, and 
families. That staff is committed to doing everything possible to help students reach their school and personal goals. 
That we will support the student in earning credits, passing all of their required exams, and to prepare them for 
college and any post-secondary opportunities. In addition to our school structure, the letter also outlines 
opportunities for students such as the LTW internship program and our emphasis and support to ensure that each 
student explores and applies for college by their senior year. The student signs the commitment letter along with 
his/her parent and AC.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Teachers develop baseline and summative assessments to use in each course. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have a school-wide system of assessments, which is followed in every course and every subject.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We are using teacher created assessments.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers are able to review the data on their own and in weekly department meetings.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47

5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The data is used to modify instruction and provide additional supports.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSELAT is used to provide system-wide information.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We share information in weekly case conferencing meetings.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered through a Push-in model.  Due to the nature of our school, instruction is delivered in an 
ungraded and heterogeneous environment.  Students receive, from push-in, differentiated ESL instruction as a part of 
their content area classes.  The instruction focuses on developing verbal and written language skills.  Content area 
teachers also meet with the ESL teacher to receive feedback on their instruction in relation to ELLs.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              By reviewing students' proficiency levels and ensuring that they have enough minutes of push-in as well as 
time in ELA class, students get the mandated amount of instructional time.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                The workshop model is the basic approach to all courses.  Students are engaged in individual and small group work 
where they can learn to both interact with peers and demonstrate their individual learning.  Extensive modeling of reading 
comprehension and writing, with the use of handouts and Smartboard, are used to ensure student understanding.  Using 
sheltered English, content area teachers scaffold material through bridging, building schema, contextualization, and 
metacognitive development.  These methods are in alignment with the CCLS by focusing on discourse, complex text, 
explanation, argumentation, purpose, structure of text, and vocabulary practices.  
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

                We ensure that ELLs receive Regents exams in their native language.  In their ELA classes, students are given 
independent reading time, and we offer books in students' native languages.  They are evaluated in their native languages by 
their written responses and connections to whole-group texts.        
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We are currently only running push-in, due to the small number of students at the school, and the parents' preferences.  As 
students demonstrate more fluency with the language, the level of rigor and difficulty in the content does increase in order to 
provide students with the necessary challenges to facilitate learning and growth.  Our instructional plan for all students--SIFE, 
newcomers-long-term ELLs, and former ELLs--varies and is differentiated based on the students' NYSESLAT scores and initial 
baseline assessments in all classes.  The ESL coordinator ensures that teachers and advocate counselors are aware of former 
ELLs, and teachers are given strategies to use in the classroom in order to reach all students (modeling, sentence starters, 
vocabulary instruction, etc.)       
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use the Reading Strategies, a WBCHS designed Writing Process, and QTEL scaffolding techniques to 
support students in accessing academic content and to accelerate English language development.  Teachers also use case-
conferencing time to meet with our SPED and ESL teachers to discuss specific student strategies, successes, and concerns. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Content area curricula are developed cooperatively as a department to ensure the scope and sequence is well scaffolded and 
that along with content knowledge, students’ skills are strengthened and developed.  Teachers share weekly outlines with 
administration in order to receive feedback regarding differentiating instruction for ELL-SWDs.  ELL-SWDs are also scheduled 
for a Literacy Intensive course with our SPED teacher once a cycle.  This course provides additional content/skills support.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
To address student needs across content areas, our ESL teacher confers with subject area teachers during a weekly case 
conferencing time.  During this time, student updates are given, including assessment results and important observations 
about their academic needs.  Additionally, our professional development program for all teachers is centered on using 
Learning Strategies to approach instruction.  This is helpful in getting teachers to use visualization and other strategies that are 
essential for English Language Learners in accessing content.  Our ESL teacher also observes and provides feedback to content 
area teachers weekly.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

None at this time.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None at this time, the data demonstrates that we do not need to deviate from our current program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

After school we have academic support available to students, including Regents tutoring and homework help.  Eight weeks 
prior to the Regents we have a Saturday Academy Program to provide additional support for students taking exams.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We are committed to using technology, visual aids, maps, word walls, and other manipulatives that support English Language 
Learners.  All classrooms are equipped with a SMART board.  We also offer a technology based mathematics course called 
“Dig/it” through the DOE. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students receive differentiated ESL instruction as a part of their content area classes.  The instruction focuses on developing 
verbal and written language skills.  Content area teachers also meet with the ESL teacher to receive feedback on their 
instruction in relation to ELLs.. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We admit new students at the start of a cycle, three times a year. At this time students engage in an orientation that allows for 
students to interact with the community and have one-on-one conversations with staff and administrators.  Students are also 
given student handbooks and student planners that are reviewed as a group.  Additionally, each student is assigned to a 
counselor group which fosters a close knit relationship with one primary person and their community leader group.  We also 
ensure that there is support for the family should the home language not be English.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are committed to using technology, visual aids, maps, word walls, and other manipulatives that support English Language 
Learners.  All classrooms are equipped with a SMART board.  We also offer a technology based mathematics course called 
“Dig/it” through the DOE. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We begin each trimester with a whole-school orientation to welcome and engage all of our subgroups.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is offered as the foreign language elective. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
There is an intense focus on professional development at the school.  Our school has consistently participated in the QTEL 
training provided by the NYC Department of Education.  Our teachers use strategies and structures that support the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

development of verbal and written language.  Our professional development program, which meets every two weeks, most 
often focuses on the scaffolding necessary for students to effectively write across content areas and defend their ideas in a 
cohesive and coherent manner.  Other PDs, for all content area teachers, have focused on departmental goal-setting, for ELLs 
and other students, and creating specific benchmarks to reach those goals.  
All of West Brooklyn's professional development sessions are closely aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  In 
addition, ESL teachers are given opportunities to participate in off-site professional development sessions that engage with 
Common Core and ELLs. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All students meet with their advocate counselors at least three times a week to ease the transition back to school.  The ESL 
coordinator regularly meets with advocate counselors about ELLs' progress.    
The monthly professional development program offers strategies and support for ELL instruction.  Additionally, feedback 
during administrative and peer observations often focuses on the use of strategies that support scaffolding student 
learning.  Currently, our ESL teacher also provides specific feedback to content area teachers by sharing ways to scaffold 
materials, classroom observations, and lesson plan development.  These records are maintained in a word file and are sent as 
attachments to teachers.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our parent involvement is high; including the parents of ELLs.  Because we provide translation services at our events, including 
PTA meetings, Open School Night, etc., often that is not a barrier to participation in these events.  Additionally, parents contact 
one person to find out how their child is doing, they do not need to be in contact 7 different people.  
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Based on the parent's suggestions and feedback we modify as needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gloria  Rosario Wallace, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
