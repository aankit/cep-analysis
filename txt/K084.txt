Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of PS 84 is to create positive members of society with active and creative minds, a sense of compassion 
for others, and influential attributes of a leader. Working closely with our talented community, we foster lifelong 
learners by cultivating the social, emotional, physical and academic needs of each child. 

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 84 is a unique school community comprised of a multi-culturally diverse group of students. We pride ourselves on 
fostering a culture of collaboration and respect amongst our parent community, teachers, students and the 
administration. The successful partnerships and initiatives we have sustained in our building are evident of the 
positive and trusting relationships we have developed with all our stakeholders.  

 

 

In order to accomplish what we set forth in our mission statement, we have developed and sustained several strategic 
partnerships and collaborations:  

 

Through Community Word Project our 3 rd grade students express themselves through drama, poetry and painting. 
teachers collaborate with residents on a weekly basis during professional development sessions. This year-long 
residency culminates with a family painting day and poetry reading. Several students are selected to attend the CWP 
Annual Benefit and represent PS 84.  

 

Spatial-Temporal (ST) Math is game-based instructional software for K-12 designed to boost math comprehension and 
proficiency through visual learning. PS 84 has sustained Integrating with classroom instruction; ST Math incorporates 
the latest research in learning and the brain and promotes mastery-based learning and mathematical understanding. 
The ST Math software games use interactive, graphically-rich animations that visually represent mathematical 
concepts to improve conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. Born out of neuroscience research at the 
University of California, Irvine, this unique approach accesses the brain’s innate “spatial-temporal” reasoning ability. 
This ability, which lies at the core of innovative thinking and sophisticated problem-solving, allows the brain to hold 
visual, mental representations in short-term memory and to evolve them in both space and time, thinking multiple 
steps ahead. The program consists of language-independent, animated representations of math concepts delivered 
via the Spatial-Temporal (ST) Math® software games.  

 

Mathletics is a math learning platform built on a foundation of solid curriculum lead content used to support the 
needs of individual learners in grades 5-8 through activities and tutorials. 

 

Through our partnership with Marquis Studios, our students in grades PreK- through 2ND grade work with teaching 
artists to develop their literacy and social skills through dance, song and theater activities. Each residency ends with a 
culminating event which showcases a collaboration of literacy and the arts. Our students in 5th grade participate in a 
film making residency where they developed short film clips focusing on equity. 

 

All staff members are trained in using Visual Thinking Strategies to develops oral and written language literacy, visual 
literacy and collaborative interactions among peers. Trainers work closely with our new staff members to coach them 
on visual thinking strategies and techniques. Classes visit various museums throughout the school year in order to 
implement the strategies learned.

Dancing Classrooms main focus is to cultivate essential life skills in students through the art of social dance. Our 4th 
grade and 8th grade students participate in a 10 week, 20 session residency in ballroom dancing which culminates 
with a borough wide competition. This year our 8th grade students joined the Dancing Classrooms residency. 

 

All staff members have been trained in Brain Power practices. Brain Power utilizes an exciting combination of physical, 
emotional and cognitive exercises to tap into our infinite brain potential. The programs empower children and adults 
to improve focus, confidence, memory, creativity and emotional wellness while reducing stress and anxiety.  

 

Jazz at Lincoln Center is committed to entertain, enrich & expand a global community for Jazz through performance, 
education and advocacy. Our 2nd and 5th grade students are exposed to jazz concerts 3 times a year in order to 
enhance their appreciation for music, culture and the arts.  

 

Our partnership with NY Sunworks has helped us in implementing our Greenhoouse Project. We are dedicated to 
improving Environmental Science Education in an urban school by providing a hands-on integrated curriculum for all 
of our students. 

 

We partnered with PlayWorks, an organization that supports learning and physical health. A trained coach is sent to 
work in our school to run a variety of games and sports as well as teach techniques in group management, violence 
prevention and conflict resolution. 

 

Our CBO partner Grand St. Settlement oversees our SONYC after-school program for our 6th, 7th and 8th graders. We 
are an ExtendED program through the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI). The primary goal of this partnership is 
to support students in becoming independent readers by providing customized small group instruction as well as 
enrichment opportunities. The after-school staff collaboratively plans for programs that bridge as well as enhance 
school day learning. The Grand St. Settlement provides enrichment opportunities for our students focusing on various 
art forms (visual arts, theater, dance, robotics, coding and culinary arts). 

 

This is the third year of the Leader in Me initiative. Staff members learned how to make leadership development a 
part of the everyday student experience including teaching leadership principles in meaningful ways, creating a 
culture of shared leadership within the school and helping students take more ownership for their academic learning 
and goal achievement. We will transition next year from students understanding the concepts of the seven habits of 
effective leaders to taking a more active role as ambassadors of this leadership initiative to create a culture of 
students empowerment.  

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

PS 84 was selected to host the only ASD Nest program in District 14. The ASD Nest program is designed to help higher 
functioning children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The goal is to design and support a therapeutic  

setting within an academic environment. Weekly teacher meetings are held to discuss in detail the specific needs of 
the individual students. Many of these strategies have been used through the rest of the school population. 
Eventually our goal will be to implement these strategies school wide.  

 

Our English Language Learners comprise 17% of our student population. Their specific needs are language-based and 
require instructional strategies that support their oral and written vocabulary development in their dominant 
language as well as English. Our ELL’s require pedagogical tools that support their learning. These include visual 
prompts, graphic organizers, Spanish language texts and audio/visual software programs. 

 

Our Students with Special Needs comprise 17% of our school population. These students are dispersed among our 
Integrated Co-teaching classes, thus providing them with a program that is in the least restrictive environment. They 
have varying needs ranging from academic to behavioral. Many of these students have delayed foundational skills in 
reading which require intensive and explicit instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness. In addition, the 
standards-aligned lessons must be modified (not “watered down”) to provide accessibility for these students. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the context of the Framework for Great Schools, PS 84 has made the most progress over the course of the year in 
Collaborative Teachers. Each team of teachers continue to be charged with analyzing student work and creating an 
Inquiry question based on the information gathered from the student data. Their work focused on improving student 
engagement and discussion techniques with a focus on English as a New Language learners (ENLs). The teachers 
participated in Action Research and dedicated their Mondays and Tuesdays to professional learning centered on the 
data captured from their research and it’s alignment to their Inquiry question. New this year, the staff voted on an 
SBO that took us from a seven to an eight period day. This allowed teachers and additional professional development 
period each week. 

We are proud of the processes we have put in place to ensure teacher collaboration. Our teachers continue to 
become adept at analyzing student data and using inquiry findings and their shared critical work to support ENL 
learning and overall student achievement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our Framework for Great Schools Report 2018 indicates that the area of Common Core Shifts in Mathematics is 
exceptional. Additionally the areas of Common Core Shifts in ELA and course clarity were highly rated. However, 
based on this report,  
70% of teachers rate the quality of student discussion below the city average. Indicating a need to incorporate 
more student discussions within our ELA writing units of study. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, teachers in grades K-8 will continue to develop rigorous writing genre units of study that are aligned to 
the Next Generation Learning Standards as measured by students moving at least one level on Teacher's College writing 
rubrics.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

On our 2018 Framework for Great Schools survey we exceeded the targets in the area of Supportive Environment 
where students indicated that the school provides safety and guidance while teachers highly rated the social 
emotional support provided for students. However, student and teacher responses indicate that there is a need to 
improve student listening skills. Therefore, our cabinet team realized there was a need to take a closer look at the 
relevance of the curriculum to the degree of student engagement amongst our subgroups. In order to improve 
students’ listening skills and thereby improve student engagement, the curriculum should be relevant to our 
students’ needs.   

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, teachers will build their capacity to bring relevance to the K-8 curriculum to promote authentic 
engagement and rigor among our culturally and linguistically diverse students as measured by movement of at least 
one level using a pre and post rubric based on Zaretta Hammond's Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain 
(2015).

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 14K084 Jose De Diego, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Jose de Diego will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right

to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

We will have two direct instruction supplemental programs that will be funded with Title III 
funds -  Saturday Academy and an ENL after-school program.The purpose of the Saturday 
Academy and after-school programs are to provide supplemental instruction to our English 
Language Learners (ELLs) in grades 2-8.  These programs will provide additional instruction in 
English Language Arts as well as Mathematics and support student academic achievement. In 
English Language Arts, the focus will be on the modalities of reading and writing.  Teachers will 
focus on these areas by teaching a reading skills-based curriculum as well as writing instruction 
as a response to reading.  The writing focus will include instruction in organization, transitional 
and linking words, as well as supporting claims using evidence.  In the content area of 
mathematics, students will focus on developing computational fluency as well as problem 
solving strategies.  There will also be a large focus on the language required to explain 
mathematical thinking for constructed response questions.Based on the 2016 state exams, 0 % of 
our ELLs were proficicient in ELA (as compared to 3% City-Wide) and only 5% of our ELLs 
were proficient in math (as compared to 14% City-Wide).  Additional data which supports our 
need for supplemental programs is our students' performance on the NYSESLAT.  Based on data 
generated by our AMAO Estimator tool, 57 out of 77 (74%) of our ELLs made progress on the 
2016-2017 NYSESLAT.    The students who will attend these two programs are ELLs in grades 
2-8, from general education classes, dual language classes and ICT classes. The language of 
instruction will be English.  Home language support will be provided to English Language 
learners. Picture dictionaries and glossaries will be used in the classrooms regularly. The skills 
and strategies that will be taught in the Saturday Academy and after-school programs will 
support both language 1 and language 2 progress.Instruction will be provided by 7 teachers who 
are certified in English as a Second Language or Bilingual Education: Terezia Chlebovcova 
(ENL teacher), Valentina Djokic (ENL Teacher), Evelyn Nunez (Dual Language Teacher), 
Teresa Bosque (Dual Language Teacher), Patricia Windle (Dual Language Teacher), Karla 
Ramirez (Dual Language Teacher) and Ally Pena (Dual Language Teacher). 
The Saturday Academy program will run for 8 four-hour sessions starting on January 5, 2019 
and ending on April 20, 2019.  Sessions will take place on Saturdays from 9a.m.-1p.m. 
There will be 7 groups in this program for grades 2-8, each consisting of 12 students. 
Group 1 - grade 2 – Evelyn Nunez 
Group 2 - grade 3 – Patricia Windle 
Group 3 - grade 4 – Karla Ramirez 
Group 4 - grade 5 – Ally Pena

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The after-school program will take place twice a week - on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 
2:45 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., starting on November 7, 2018 and ending on April 25, 2019. 
We will have seven groups of ELLs (grades 2-8), with 1:12 ratio. The students will be grouped 
by grade and proficiency levels, each group being taught by either a certified ENL or Bilingual 
teacher. 
Group 1 - grade 2 – Evelyn Nunez 
Group 2 - grade 3 – Patricia Windle 
Group 3 - grade 4 – Karla Ramirez 
Group 4 - grade 5 – Ally Pena 
Group 5 - grade 6 – Teresa Bosque 
Group 6 – grade 7 – Terezia Chlebovcova 
Group 7 - grade 8 - Valentina Djokic 
There will be 41 sessions (2 hours, and 15 minutes each). 
The materials for instruction will be supplemental and distinct from those used for daily 
instruction. We will use Rehearsing for the Common Core Standards Reading and Rehearsing for 
the Common Core Standards Mathematics. Also, we will use Finish Line New York ELLs 
Bilingual Common Core (grades 2-8). 
We will also have Community Word Project will take place once a week for an hour over 
twenty-five weeks beginning September 2018 through May 2019. Through Community Word 
Project, our ELLs will focus on developing their oral and written language through the use of 
poetry and narratives. Instruction will be provided in both English (L2) and Spanish (L1) by two 
bilingual teaching artist and certified bilingual education teachers. Students will also express 
themselves artistically by incorporating visual arts activities. Community Word Project will 
provide all materials needed for this supplemental program.Ms. Christina Rosario, Assistant 
Principal, will supervise both the Saturday Academy and after-school programs. She will 
maintain agendas and attendance sheets . Ms. Rosario will monitor and document students' 
progress. She will also ensure that all the notifications and letters for the parents be provided in 
English and parents' preferred language(s). The agendas and attendance sheets will be 
maintained by the supervisor and kept in the main office. The supervisor will also stay with 
students who are being picked up late and make phone calls, as needed. Ms. Rosario's regular 
work hours are 7:30a.m.-3:30p.m.

All following professional development is at cost to the Title III Program. 
Our school's Title lll professional development program for teachers will be centered around and 
based on both teacher's and student's needs. The focus will be on the stages of language 
acquisition, language learning, language objectives and vocabulary building. Title III Program 
teachers will attend PD sessions and workshops on language learning, language objectives and 
teaching vocabulary to SIFE, entering and emerging level ELLs. The Title III teachers will work 
on lessons that will have both linguistic and communicative components essential for the 
language acquisiton of our ELLs.

Part C: Professional Development  
These PD sessions will positively impact the progress of ELLs, as they are based on essential 
needs of our ELLs (language acquisition, vocabulary building, and focus on all 4 modalities), as 
well as on the needs of our teachers who have ELLs in their classrooms (vocabulary building - 
Tier I, II and III, and stages of language acquisition - how ELLs acquire the language - both 
native and the English language). The PD sessions will greatly improve the instruction provided 
to ELLs in their classrooms, as teachers will implement the scaffolding techniques and support 
that will lead to more progressive learning of our ELLs, and eventually, their greater 
independence in the classroom. 
The PD sessions and workshops will take place once a month (on Fridays, from 2:40p.m.-
4:00p.m.), starting on September 28, 2018. They will be provided by Ms. Monique Hernandez, 
Assistant Principal,  and our ENL teachers, Ms. Valentina Djokic and Ms. Terezia Chlebovcova. 
Ms. Hernandez will supervise the PD sessions and workshops. She will maintain agendas and 
attendance sheets. They will be kept in her office. 
Below is the schedule of the PD sessions up to February 2/8/2019; the additional PDs (March 
through May) will be provided in accordance with the needs of teachers of ELLs: 
1. 9/28/2018 - Writing Effective Language Objectives for ELLs in K-2

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Fountas & Pinnell Running Records, Estrellitas, Fundations,  NYSITELL and teacher-created assessments to 
assess the progress of our ELL’s literacy skills in all grades.   
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Students are assessed with Fountas and Pinnell during the fall, winter and spring.  Estrellitas is used daily in kindergarten, first 
grade and as needed in second grade. Fundations is used daily for 30 minutes in kindergarten through third grade.  It is also 
used as an academic intervention support two to three times per week in a small group setting. Students are assessed 
periodically throughout instruction and time is allocated for teachers to review the data. 
    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
ENL students are assessed using the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, WIST and TOSWRF in order to gather baseline data, monitor progress 
and identify areas of need. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, it is disaggregated, analyzed and used to place students in appropriate programs 
and classes with the supports and resources they need.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Tier I RTI is provided by classroom teachers, and supported by the ENL teachers. If a student does not make adequate 
progress, the school’s RTI committee meets to discuss next steps to support the student. Those steps include Tier II and Tier III 
instruction which is provided by specialized out-of-classroom teachers. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
A review of the 2016 NYSESLAT & NYSITELL proficiency results indicates the following patterns: 
•     In first grade, 75% of ELL's scored within the entering through transitioning levels 
•     In second grade, 50% of ELL's scored within the entering through transitioning levels, and 50% of ELL's sscored within 
the expanding and commanding levels 
•     In third grade, 68% scored at expanding and commanding levels 
•     In fourth grade, 56% scored at entering through transitioning levels 
•     In fifth grade, 59% scored at entering through transitioning levels 
•     In sixth grade, 58% scored at expanding and commanding levels 
•     In seventh grade, 62% scored at expanding and commanding levels 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In September, teachers analyze school wide data and trends to identify areas of strength and areas of need. Then, grade level 
teams dive deeper into their specific grade's data to plan curriculum.  Teachers use this data and their formative assessments 
to develop lesson plans, scaffold instruction and gather appropriate resources. for their students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ELL programming includes ESL services which are provided using the integrated and stand alone instructional 
model. As for push-in model, students are grouped by grade and heterogeneous proficiency levels. As for Pull-out 
model, new commers are grouped together.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

ELL students in TBE or Dual Language programs are mandated to receive the same amount of specific units of ESL as 
students in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Freestanding ESL model. Both ELLs and EPs receive 50% of instruction in English, and 50% in target language – 
Spanish. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           P.S. 84 makes many considerations and adjustments in order to comply with the mandated service minutes required for 
each language proficiency level and the needs of our ELLs.  The ESL and dual language teachers provide services to all eligible 
students.  
        Our ELLs at the entering and emerging levels receive 180 minutes of push-in ESL services, also known as integrated ENL, 
and 180 minutes of pull-out ESL services.  
        Our ELLs at transitioning level receive 90 minutes of push-in ESL services, also known as integrated ENL, and 90 minutes of 
pull-out  ESL services.     
        Our ELLs at expanding level receive 180 minutes of push-in ESL services, also known as integrated ENL.  
        Our ELLs at commanding level receive 90 minutes of push-in ESL services, also known as integrated ENL, during ELA or 
content area. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Literacy instruction in both ESL and Dual Language programs takes place through a Balanced Literacy (Word Study, Guided 
Reading and Writing, Shared Reading and Writing, and Read Aloud) approach which is taught based on units which were 
developed to address the New York State Common Core ELA standards.  Teachers use various ESL techniques and 
methodologies to make content comprehensible in order to foster the ELLs’ language development and meet the demands of 
the Common Core Learning Standards.  
        Mathematics instruction is carried out using Go Math and resources  based on the New York State Common Core Math 
standards.   
        Science and Social studies are taught by integrating them into literacy units. In the Dual Language classroom, these 
content areas may be taught in either English or Spanish, depending on the time or the day, or the needs of the learners. 
        The instruction in ESL program is delivered in English, and in Dual Language Program, the instruction is delivered in English 
and Spanish (50-50 split).      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   All Native Spanish speakers who qualify for services in Dual Language Programs or ESL are assessed in their native language 
using Fountas and Pinnell and the ELE..       
        Spanish reading levels are also assessed throughout the year.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) require special attention in order for them to succeed in our educational 
system. We adjust our instructional approaches used to reach SIFE pupils depending on factors such as native language and 
the level of native language literacy skills. Besides after school programs and additional academic intervention, our plan to 
service these students includes teaching grade level content as well as the numerous skills that SIFE students are often 
lacking.  Therefore language classes will be structured in order to address both past content objectives and current content 
objectives.  For example, a SIFE in third grade may need instruction in order to develop literacy skills that his or her peers 
received in earlier grades.  Additionally, a SIFE will receive the opportunity to practice these skills in an age appropriate 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

environment.  SIFE students will also be grouped together with peers in order to provide motivation, support, and language 
acquisition opportunities.  
b.  Newcomer students at P.S. 84 are serviced with the intention of giving them the language skills they need to function 
successfully in their new country, community, and school.  As is the situation with SIFE students, newcomers will also be 
placed with English speaking peers in an age appropriate environment in order to present them with language acquisition 
opportunities and extrinsic motivation as well as support from their peers.   
Since many newcomers arrive with little to no English in any of the four language skill areas and often with little to no literacy 
skills in their native language, our newcomers will receive ESL services that are intended to provide both content area and 
second language instruction with the intent of developing both Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) and Cognitive 
Academic Language Proficiency (CALP).  Literacy and language development will take place through student participation in 
the reading and writing workshops in their classrooms as well as further more specialized instruction from their ESL 
teacher.  ESL teachers will work to make content area and language instruction accessible to students by employing sheltered 
English content instruction as well as  
scaffolding techniques.  In addition to these supports newcomers should also receive extra attention through after-school 
programs and additional academic intervention.   
c.  Students who have been receiving services for 4 to 6 years will receive services based on their level of language 
proficiency.  A student who is at the beginner level will receive support for reaching the common core and be given access to 
lessons which are designed to meet the Common Core Standards.  Students in this subgroup will also be given attention 
according to our school's RTI plan.   
d.  We will service long term ELLs under the belief that each student progresses at his or her own rate through the 
language acquisition process.  Furthermore, we believe any group of learners will be made up of students who are at different 
stages in their language acquisition and cognitive development.  Following the natural order of language acquisition presented 
by theorists many students will develop BICS first and CALP second.  Accordingly, our primary focus for long term ELLs will be 
to develop CALP so that students can achieve mastery of reading, writing, speaking and listening skills for application in 
academic content areas.  In order to provide them with the extra instruction necessary for success, long term ELLs will also 
receive instruction in after-school  
programs and in some cases individualized intervention plans.   
e.  Former ELLs will receive support for two years after they test commanding on the NYSESLAT.  These students will receive 
support of 90 minutes in integrated ENL program. They will also be offered seats in our after-school programs and Saturday 
Academy.   
  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our school uses the Balanced Literacy approach to reading to provide access to academic content and to accelerate English  
Language Development.  Falling under the umbrella of Balanced Literacy, instructional strategies include shared reading, 
guided  
reading, independent reading as well as shared writing and independent writing.  Balanced Literacy also includes the use of 
oral  
language to discuss texts as well as ideas in writing.   
Materials include Pearson's ReadyGen curriculum as well as our school's guided reading library.      
ELLs/ SWDs also participate in the Read 180 program.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We have used curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWD's to achieve their IEP goals and 
attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  For example, we have opened ICT classes in grades K-8 in 
order to accommodate students with IEPs and to keep them in the least restrictive environment.  Additionally, we also provide 
academic intervention supports to struggling ELLs.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention is carried out based on our school’s RTI plan.  Tier I intervention for ELLs in ELA, Math, Social Studies, 
and Science takes place in the classroom, either with the classroom teacher or the ESL teacher.  Within the classroom, there is 
a Toolkit for ELLs specifically which includes aides and supports that could help ELLs complete a task within any content area 
(picture dictionaries, alphabet and blends chart, etc.). Tier II intervention takes place in small groups in the classroom and is 
reinforced in after school programs (ESL after school and ELA / Math after school programs).  Planning and communication 
between the ESL teacher and classroom teacher is mandatory.  Tier III intervention is delivered in a pull-out setting if it is 
deemed necessary.  The language of instruction in these interventions is English.  Our school’s RTI plan is constructed to 
address the needs of learners from all sub-groups (SIFE, Newcomers, ELLS with Special Needs). 
Specific interventions used throughout the school depending on the grade are Read 180, Wilson, Fountas & Pinnell 
Intervention kits and Fundations.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will continue to provide professional learning to teachers and we will continue our inquiry work around best practices for 
ENLs.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  They are offered seats in our Saturday Academy and YMCA after-school 
tutoring program.  Also, ELLs participate in our Education Through Music Program, Visual Thinking Strategies, Greenhouse 
Classroom, Trout in the Classroom, Bhangra Dance, Ballroom Dancing, Community Word Project, and Circus Arts.  According to 
the Danielson Framework for teaching, all teachers are required to create multiple access points in their lessons for different 
students, including ELLs.  This allows for ELLs to participate in lessons throughout the school.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ESL programs use the following materials – ReadyGen, Engage NY, On Our Way to English leveled libraries, Language Power 
and National Geographic library.  
Pearson ReadyGen, Engage NY Word Generation and Houghton Mifflin's GoMath Curriculum are used to support ELLs in their 
classrooms.  Additional materials used to support ELLs include but are not limited to our guided reading book room, big books, 
lap tops, and computer lab.  Specifically, ELLs use technology through the MIND Research ST Math program. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the dual language program, native language support is delivered in a variety of ways. The following strategies and programs 
are used to support native language instruction: 
•     total physical response 
•     visual prompts 
•     realia 
•     repetition 
•     leveled libraries  
•     guided reading  
•     authentic literature in the native language 
•     small group instruction 
•     Estrellitas program for phonetic support 
•     Descubre literacy program online activities 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services support, and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels.  ELLs at P.S. 84 are always placed in age 
appropriate grade levels for instruction.  The materials and services provided here are appropriate for each student’s needs.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
NA 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
One of the activities in our school that support newly enrolled ELLs is assigning a learning partner / buddy in their classroom 
who speaks the same language to ease their transition. The parent coordinator, ENL teachers and/or classroom teachers take 
the students on a school tour.  
The parents of newly enrolled students are provided with materials in their native language in order to assist them before the 
school year.  Additionally, our Parent Coordinator works during summer registration and is there to assist them.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is a language elective in grades 6-8. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a.  In our Dual language Program the target language is used for EP’s and ELL’s fifty percent (50%) of the 
time. The self-contained dual language classes in kindergarten follow an A/B schedule which means that 
they teach in the target language of Spanish on one day (the A day) and in English on the following day 
(the B day).  In grades 1-5, we follow the side-by-side model, with one teacher providing instruction in 
English, and the other is Spanish.  
b.  Core content areas are taught in both English and Spanish.  
c.  Each dual language class is taught by a bilingual teacher. Each subject is taught fifty percent (50%) of 
the time in Spanish and  
50% in English. 
d.  Emergent literacy is taught simultaneously in both languages.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for all personnel at the school is designed to support the implementation of the New York 
State Common Core Standards (CCS).  Professional development designed to support the CCS begins with guidance in 
designing common core aligned units in math and English Language Arts.  All teachers, including ENL/ESL teachers, dual 
language teachers, and teachers of students with disabilities receive guidance from our school's team of instructional 
specialists.  Planning sessions are held during common preparation periods and PD time on Mondays. Units are designed along 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

with ESL teachers as well as classroom teachers to allow for collaborative planning that will promote more effective planning 
for push-in periods.      
   Additionally, professional development is tied to the language of the Danielson Framework for teaching.  This area of 
professional development at PS 84 focuses on the topics of planning and preparation, managing classroom procedures, 
classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities.  Specifically, topics include questioning and discussion 
techniques, creating lessons with multiple access points for all learners, and aligning lesson procedures with lesson 
objectives.  Our model teachers, along with administration have facilitated this work.   
Administrators observe teachers and provide focused feedback on instruction and all other domains of teaching.  Through this 
process of observation and feedback, teacher and administrator agree on areas of focus.  Based on the individual needs of a 
teacher, they can choose from a menu of professional development activities.  For example, teachers visit the classrooms of 
colleagues and debrief with the instructional support specialist using language from the Danielson Framework.  This process is 
ongoing throughout the year.       
Our professional development plan for new teachers includes a mentoring component.  New teachers, including teachers of 
ELLs receive support from an assigned mentor.  Mentees receive at least two hours per week of time with their 
mentor.  Mentors guide new teachers in all the domains of the Danielson Framework.   
15% of all PDs offered to the entire teaching staff will include the ESL methodology.  
  
Throughout the year, P.S. 84, will offer on-site PD and off-site PD opportunities to address the needs of ELL students: 
* Brain Research - Keeping ELLs in Mind 
* Instructional Strategies: Differentiation Strategies 
* Intervention Protocol 
* Unpacking the Standards 
* Differentiation in the Classroom 
* Visual Thinking Strategies 
* Websites and Interactive White Boards 
* Teachers College-Units of Study in Writing 
* Teachers College Saturday Reunion Workshops 
  
Professional development which is specifically targeted towards ELL personnel and Bilingual teachers is offered in our school as 
well as out of the building.  Within our building, administration and instructional support specialists provide staff with PD on 
guided reading, constructivist math problem solving methods, and the components of balanced literacy.  This support is 
provided as described in question number 1 of this section.   
Outside of our building, teachers attend meetings at Fordham University and Office of ELLs, and, in previous years, PDs offered 
by our network.  These sessions demonstrate specific strategies for adapting instruction to increase student engagement and 
increase academic talk.  Personnel will attend other meetings sponsored by our Brooklyn North Field Support Center as 
announced.  New teachers are also trained in Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) as a method to increase authentic opportunities 
for the use of oral academic language. 
50% of all PD offered to ENL teachers must be ENL-related.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In order to train our staff in supporting ELLs as they transition from Elementary to Middle School, our fifth grade teachers work 
with the 6-8 math and ELA and Math CCS.  They plan their 5th grade units according to levels of text complexity.  
Our school counselor work with 5th grade students and their families to ensure they are aware of the enrollment process – the 
directory of middle schools, the application process and the transition to middle school. The guidance counselor has received 
training in the Learning Partners Program and the Middle School Quality Initiative, MSQI, to reach out to all ELL parents and 
students through the Home Teacher Visit Program.  
In our school, 15% of all PD offered to the entire teaching staff will include ESL methodology, and the 50% of all PD

All agendas and attendance are kept in a binder in the main office in order to document PD activities. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Teachers provide individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, 
language proficiency assessments results, and language development needs in all contents areas during the weekly parent 
involvement session (every Tuesday). Parents schedule an appointment with the teacher at their convenience. Interpretation 
and translation is provided as needed, in the parents’ preferred language of choice. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parental involvement at P.S. 84 is strong.  Our parents, including our ELL parents are involved through the following programs: 
•     Learning Leaders - parents assisting in the classrooms/library/cafeteria 
•     Parent Academy - ESL./Spanish/Citizenship classes are held on Saturday mornings in 8 week cycles.   
•     Wonderful Wednesdays - once a month, all parents are invited into the building to participate in a themed activity in their 
child’s classroom 
•     Parent Common Core Standards Workshops - Facilitated by the Parent Coordinator, this series of classes introduces 
parents to the language and expectations of the New York Common Core State Standards 
•     School Leadership Team Meetings, School Safety Committee Meetings 
•     Annual ELL parent conference offered by the NYCDOE

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sereida Rodriguez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The methodology used to assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs begins at 
registration. First, each parent is asked to complete the "Preferred Language Form" upon registration. In addition, 
we use Home Language Identification Surveys to determine the needs for written translation and oral 
interpretation. At registration, each parent fills out a Home Language Identification Survey, where they choose 
the language in which they want to receive written information and communicate orally. In addition, every parent 
is required to fill out the blue Emergency Contact card which indicates if they prefer written communication or 
oral communication. We keep precise records regarding their choice, so that all information is provided in their 
respective languages. Once registration is complete, teachers and administrators are able to access parent written 
and oral interpretation preferences via the ARIS website. We will continue to monitor the languages that parents 
speak as newly enrolled students enter our building on an ongoing basis in order for the school community to be 
aware of the various languages preferred by parents.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

The families at P.S. 84 have documented 
their preferred languages for both 
written and oral communication to be 
English and Spanish. Although we have 
many other languages represented in 
our school (Albanian, Italian, Hebrew, 
Polish, etc.), those parents have 
indicated their preference is to receive 
information and communicate with the 
school in English.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school fulfills parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services in the following ways: 

- We translate documents containing critical information regarding a student's education in each of the documented 
languages when possible. We do this at the school level when possible and if staff is unable to provide translation, the 
school will send it to the Translation and Interpretation Unit where it will be translated and returned to us. 

- We provide translation and interpretation services for parents by making the following available to parents and staff: 
The Translation and Interpretation brochure, the Language ID guide to aid parents upon arrival to school if they speak 
a language that is not spoken in the school, the Language Palm "I speak…" card to teachers and staff. 

- We collect data regarding the primary language spoken by the parent(s) of each child enrolled in the school and 
whether such parent requires language assistance to communicate with the DOE. 

- We work on increasing parental awareness regarding parents' right to and the availability of language services. 

- We develop a school-based language access plan.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will use a parent survey and PTA meetings to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability 
of services. Depending on parent interest, our school is considering conducting a focus group of parents inclusive of all 
cultures and languages represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices on how we monitor our 
translation and interpretation for the school.
