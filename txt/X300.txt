Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8

School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you

monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title 

I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Community School 300 is a diverse and collaborative school that believes "It takes a village to raise a community of 
children." Our students will acquire the knowledge, skills, and self-esteem our students will need to become 
compassionate and responsible citizens. We are dedicated to achieving high standards of academic excellence by 
making collaborative and strategic decisions about curriculum and learning based on the Common Core Learning 
Standards. As a school community these decisions help us to create a strong academic foundation, which prepares 
our students for college and / or careers in their future. We encourage a strong home / school partnership to create a 
positive, safe, and nurturing environment. Our parental community is welcomed as valued participants in their child's 
education. Through supportive and encouraging leadership, our students, staff and community are empowered to 
work to their maximum potential...and become life long learners. Areas of celebration for our school are strong family 
and community ties, effective school leadership, collaborative environment and trust. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Community School 300 is an elementary school with 615 students from grades Pre-K through grade 5. The school's 
population is comprised of 39% Black, 60% Hispanic, 1% White. Our student body includes 14% English Language 
Learners, 30% students with disabilities. Our average attendance rate for the 2015-2016 school year was 90%. 

 

Community School 300 is a community of lifelong learners. We feel safe, confident, and loved in our school. This 
statement is not only our belief but our mission. School leaders and faculty work together to promote an atmosphere 
of high expectations , collaboration and togetherness. Our explicit communication system enables parents to know 
about the Common Core Learning Standards and the strategies needed to help our students gain success. Our school 
integrates instructional shifts, and makes purposeful decisions to build coherence. By teaching students to make their 
thinking visible, we are able to ensure academic tasks are rigorous across grades levels including entry points for 
learners such as ENL students and SWD. Across all classrooms, teachers use rubrics, formative and summative 
assessments, tack students progress and adjust curricular to meet the needs of students. Across classrooms teachers 
engage students in learning through varied cooperative learning activities and check for students conceptual 
understanding. 

 

At the core of Community School 300's mission is to provide students and families with a safe and nurturing 
environment. Through the S.I.S.T.A.H (Sisters Inspiring Sisters to Achieve Higher) program conflict resolution for girls 
and Restorative Justice Program in conjunction with the Morning side Center provides social -emotional learning for 
our students. Sports in the Morning program for boys and girls is a daily academic / sports program to help our 
students; ENL students and SWD in grades 3 through 5. This program also promotes academic success and improved 
attendance to school. We host a variety of parent engagement activities throughout the school year ranging from our 
weekly Parent Book Club / Parent Support Group, Learning Leaders, monthly PTA meetings, Family Literacy / 
Multicultural Day, movie night, family game night basket bonanza, "muffins with mom", "donuts with dad", Father / 
Daughter and Mother / Son dances. Partnerships with families to support student’s academic progress across all 
grade levels toward college and career readiness are impacted through our relationships with the Bronx Botanical

the selection of appropriate assessment measures during teams meetings.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The School of Science and Applied Learning in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Community School 300 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             43

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.;

system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act.

The direct instruction supplemental ENL Program's rationale is that ENL students in grades K-5 
need to acquire content area knowledge in science, social studies and non- fiction texts to prepare 
for the NYSESLAT and NYS ELA.   Our ENL teachers will provide instruction to ENLs in K, 
1st, and 2nd grade that scored below commanding on the NYSESLAT exam.  In addition, we 
will also service students in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades who have scored 3 or below on 
the NYS ELA.  The focuses will be writing, vocabulary development, reading comprehension, 
and problem solving strategies and improvement of all four language modalities. 
 
The ENL after school program will begin on November 14th  from 2:45 pm - 4:00 pm on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays and remain in session until May, 2019 for approximately 40 
sessions..  Language of instruction will be in English. We have three certified ENL teachers and 
one Common Branches teacher who will provide direct instruction through four flexible 
grouping of students of 10, based on data received from the NYSESLAT. Students will be 
grouped according to proficiency levels, EN, EM, and TR, EX, CM. Our leveled 3 students who 
scored proficiency in ELA and CM on the NYSESLAT will receive literacy support working 
with our ENL program as well as our ELA program for level 3 and 4 students.  The program 
activities will consist of writing on demand tasks, guided reading activities, word work tasks, 
vocabulary development, address the four modalities of the NYSESLAT exam; reading, 
listening, writing and speaking.   
 
Home and targeted language programs will be used to provide language acquisition support for 
students who are not native speakers of English.  Scaffold support using technology, audio 
supports and visuals aids will be provided for students TBE programs. 
 
The supplement materials that will be used are Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT (Attanasio & 
Associates, Inc.) & Finish Line New York ELLs Bilingual Common Core (Continental) Also, I-
Ready, and content area text:  notebooks, folders, and charts. 
 
Students from grades K-5 will be monitored by flexible groups in their ENL proficiency levels. 
ENL and content area teachers in literacy and social studies  will provide content support for 
student learning through an inter grated co-teaching / team teaching  model.  Teachers will 
collaborate with lesson plan development and implementation using student data to help inform 
instruction.  Also teachers will monitor student progress and goals for their group.

Our ENL Coordinator and ENL Teacher will facilitate professional development sessions for our 
Title III Program. Title III Program Teachers will participate in professional development 
training using NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and NYS Math test results to inform instruction, 
vocabulary Instruction, and to build academic language across subject areas, as well as 
differentiation of instruction for mathematics, reading and writing for ENL's students.  Our ENL 
Team will analyze and design the following and focus on the specific needs of ENL's: analyzing 
NYSESLAT data to identify individual student needs, Identifying ENL students who are not 
meeting the standards in ELA / Math or both, itemizing skills that need to be addressed and 
designing differentiated lessons that focus on these skills. Also, analyzing data and sharing 
instructional best practices to staff during professional development sessions and during common 
planning meetings.   
 
The Professional developments will positively impact the progress of ELL’s. Motivating students 
and differentiating their instruction are two are the major challenges teachers face on a daily 
basis. Conceptualized as students’ energy and drive to engage, learn, work effectively, and 
achieve their potential at school, motivation and engagement play a large role in students’ 
interest and enjoyment of school. This will positively impact the progress of ELL’s and allow 
teachers to support the needs of the students. 
 
Professional development is defined as the process of improving staff skills and competencies 
needed to produce outstanding educational results for students. The need for high-quality 
ongoing professional development that deepens teachers’ content knowledge and pedagogical 
skills; provides opportunities for practice, research, and reflection; and includes efforts that are 
job embedded, sustained, and collaborative will assist in the goal to remain up-to-date. 
 
 
The Professional Development will be held on Mondays from 2:20pm-3:40pm, also during 
Common Planning times and grade leader meetings. The PD’s topics will consist of ENL 
programming, NYSESLAT, Testing of ELL’s, Parent Engagement, and Student ELL data, 
Integrated and Stand Alone ENL.The PD’s will consist from ½ an hour to an hour. There will be

Parents are invited to meetings with our ENL teachers to discuss how they can help their children 
with homework, to discuss the academic success of their child and the importance of advanced 
preparation for the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and NYS Math assessments. 
 
Also, our Parent Coordinator and ENL teacher will provide parents with on-going professional 
development activities. We will conduct outreach to support parents and provide information 
regarding upcoming events, assessments and to address any parental concerns. 
 
 Our school notifies parents via telephone and through correspondences and the Parent wiki-
space on line community regarding programs being offered at school.  The workshops occur 
monthly and include NYSESLAT, Testing of ELL’s, Parent Engagement, Student ELL data, 
Math assessment, after school programs, promotion policy, helping your child with 
reading/math, housing clinics and health clinics.  
 
If needed, translation will be available at the Professional Development to meet the needs of

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tool used to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs is Fountas and Pinnell.  Over 40 % of students in grades K 
through 2 continue to meet the EOY benchmark from Fountas and Pinnell.  The insight our data provides us information 
regarding our ELLs who made gains from the BOY results to MOY.  Also, teachers use BOY and MOY results to improve the 
instruction for students. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures in place to support this effort is to provide small group instruction to ELL students and Schoolafter school 
targeted intervention program for ELL students in grades K-5. 
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             55 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 The school evaluates the success of the ELL program by the students’ outcomes of the Fountas and Pinnell data in reading and 
writing.  Chapter unit assessments in both mathematics and English Language Arts and the improvement of scores on the 
following exams NYSISTELL, annual NYS ELA and math assessments and Fountas and Pinnell results in reading and writing.  We 
examine the data results of ELL students based upon the NYSISTELL  results for each grade level: 30 % of kindergarten ELLs 
performed on the intermediate level, 40 % of 1st grade ELL's performed at intermediate level,  20 % of second grade ELLs are 
performing at  the beginner level, 40 % of third grade students performed at the intermediate level and 40 % of fifth grade 
ELLs performed at the intermediate level.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

School Administrators and our data specialist will analyze the summative data to create intervention plans and next steps to 
support ELL instruction for students.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
5. Our Ell students are provided with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to match their learning needs, as 
demonstrated by performance on periodic assessments.  Our school uses this model for ELLs to determine whether students 
are benefiting from an instructional program within a reasonable time.  Also,  to build more effective instructional programs 
for students who are in need  of more intensive services / instruction.  In addition, we designed effective individualized 
instructional programs for both Ells who receive general education and special education services using the RTI model.  Our 
school uses Fountas and Pinnell as a baseline assessment for RTI and based on this data instruction is differientiated for 
students.                           
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
      The data reveals that NYSITELL scores were evenly matched acrossT proficiency levels with students receiving  scores of 
Beginner/Entering,   Intermediate/Transitioning, Advanced/Expanding, or Proficient/Commanding on the NYSITELL.  The data 
reveals that most ELLs score at the Proficient(P) Level on one  or more parts of the NYSESLAT; since students  score at  the  B/E 
(17%),  I/T (24%),  A/E  (20%)  E/ (29%),1 P (10%)level on  one or more parts and are not scoring Proficient  on all parts of the 
assessment,  this results in them receiving a score of B/E, I/T,  A/E or P as the over all score.   The patterns across the NYSITEL 
and NYSESLAT data reveal that across proficiency levels ELLs is that they require additional vocabulary development and 
intensive building of background knowledge across science and social studies non fiction areas, reading strategies for non-
fiction texts  and intensive yet differentiated instruction of writing strategies and critical thinking skills for ELLs.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The school net data tool will be used to make the adjustments to our ELL programs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  The Organizational model for ESL instruction is that the ESL teacher works with students in a pull-out/push-in 
program. Our students are grouped for instruction based upon their academic needs  and strengths.  Students are

assessed by their teachers to determine intervention services and additional academic support.  Student work 
samples, summative and formative testing results determine the frequency of additional academic support for 
students throughout the school.  Also, our ESL teacher provides the required ESL instruction for each student to 
maximize their learning.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           In the ESL programs, students are taught by one ESL teacher and one bilingual teacher.  Ms. Ragguette services ELLs 
using the push-in model.   Ms. Hernandez  also services a using the pull-out model.  The ESL teacher services students from K-
5, both ELLs and ELLS/SWD disaggregated by grade level  based on english proficiency level: Beginner(B) , Intermediate (I), and 
Advanced(A).   B/I meet for 8 periods a week.  The Advanced students meet for 4 periods a week.  The ESL teacher uses 
Treasure Chest Program materials that are Science and Social Studies and ELA based ESL curriculums.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    In the general education classes where ELL students receive instruction in mathematics by their general education teacher. 
The Science and Social Studies teachers  push into the classes provide instruction in English.  The ESL teacher uses the Treasure 
Chest Program an ESL program taught in english and the Brain Pop internet program that specifically covers Science, Social 
Studies, Mathematics and ELA topics in Spanish and Brain Pop ESL taught in English.    
 In the ESL pull-out program the teacher prepares to make sure of the following: 
1.) Concepts taught are directly linked to students’ background experience. This experience can be personal, cultural or 
academic. The teacher explicitly makes links between past learning and new concepts. The teacher ensures that key 
vocabulary is emphasized. new vocabulary is presented in context and the number of vocabulary items is limited. In addition, 
the teacher ensures comprehensible input by using speech that is appropriate for students' language proficiency and making 
the explanation of the tasks clear using step-by-step manner with visuals. Also, the teacher uses a variety of techniques to 
make content concepts are clear and focus the students’ attention selectively on the most important information.  In the ESL 
program the following strategies are used to make content more comprehensible for students.  We provide several 
opportunities for students to use learning strategies for reading, vocabulary and writing across content areas; these strategies 
are taught through explicit instruction so that  students develop independence in self-monitoring. 2.) We consistently use 
scaffolding techniques throughout the lesson. 3.) We introduce a new concept using scaffolding and decrease support as time 
goes on. 4.) The teacher models with think-a-louds, 5.) The teacher asks students questions using a variety of question types to 
promote higher level thinking skills. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    We ensure that ELLS are appropriately evaluated in their home language by the ESL teacher testing students during the 
beginning, mid year and end year .

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

When we differentiate instruction for out SIFE students, we also offer additional instructional and intervention opportunities 
during the instructional day and after school porgrams.  Our school analyzes and considers the needs of SIFE ELLs by giving 
them opportunities to have peer buddies, mainstreaming opportunities and focused leveled instruction through push-in and 
pull out services.  
b. ) WWhen we diffferntiate for ELL students who have been in the United States less than three years,  the teacher 
differentiates their instruction. Our students who have 4-6 years of service or who are long-term ELL students, receive 
focused-leveled pull-out instruction from our ESL teacher.  Also, these students are mainstreamed into a monolingual class for 
literacy and mathematics.  
 Our students who have 4-6 years of service or who are long-term ELL students receive focused-leveled pull-out instruction 
from our ESL teacher.  Also, these students are mainstreamed to a monolingual class for literacy and mathematics.  
  Long term ELL students are provided with  rigorous differientiated instruction.  We provide small group instruction, 
scaffolding,   audio-visual technology and re-wording instruction in both mathematics and ELA into simple steps.  
  We continue to provide students with ESL services. In addition these services are supplemented with Saturday and after-
school ESL, ELA and mathematic programs.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 ELLs- SWD have the opportunity to work with ELLs without disabilities in push-in and pull-out services for literacy, science, 
social studies during the day.  After school, both groups of students work together in the ELA, math preparation and Sports and 
Arts in School Foundation programs.    Instructionally, we are flexible in that we use writing assessments that allow for the 
various usage of writing mechanics.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses instructional and flexible scheduling to meet the needs of our ELL students and -SWD.  The ESL teacher pushes 
into our Integrated Co- Teaching classes to provide ESL instruction to students.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
When the school creates groups for Inquiry / Extended Day programs, we use reading and mathematics data to form these 
programs and to target instruction for students.  We also,  target the interventions which address the needs of  students- we 
provide the students, guided reading support and vocabulary development skills based on their reading levels and NYSESLAT 
results.    The ESL program provides targeted interventions for ELLS in both reading, writing, for the ELA/ NYSESLAT scores.  In 
addition, we use the  Wilson and Fundations reading programs,  Words Their Way phonics program, the Treasure Chest ESL 
Literacy program and Earobics software in English and Imagine Learning English a technology based language acquisition 
program for ELL student.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 We have an inquriy focus for selected students, morning afterschool and Saturday program opportunities for students.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELL students are afforded the opportunity to be apart of a Inquiry focus, SISTAH and Man Up Global conflict resolution 
programs, Good Shepherd Services Inc.,  Ballet Tech, Pencil Partnership, and Sports and Arts in School Foundation,  within our 
school community.  We provide ELL parents information about these programs in their native language.  We also have 
information sessions where we invite ELL parents formally to enroll their students in programs.  In addition, we use Title III 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             58 

 

funds to provide supplementary instruction.  Also, after school programs are provided to ELL students in preparation for the 
NYSESLAT, ELA and MATH exams. The goals of the ESL program are to enable students to learn english and to support their 
success in all content area and classroom instruction. The direct instruction provides students in grades K-5 with the 
opportunity to acquire background knowledge in Science, Social Studies and non- fiction content.  ELL students in K-2 who 
scored below proficiency are provided with the opportunity for NYSESLAT test preparation instruction. In addition, we will also 
service ELLs in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades who scored a level 3 and below in an ELA and Math test prep programs. The K-2 
NYSESLAT program for ELLS  meet Tuesdays and Thursdays 3:30PM-5:30 pm from November until April. This program 
encourages English Language Proficiency in all 4 language areas across the content areas.  The program will integrate academic 
language encountered by ELLs in all content areas. The teachers will employ whole language, SIOP, the Natural Approach and 
TPR.  The 3-5 ELA /Math Program for ELA and Math meets Mondays and Fridays 2:30-4:30 pm and Saturdays from 9am-1pm 
from November until May.   It will focus on continued work in writing and composition, and mathematical skills including word 
problems that challenge ELLS.  The language of instruction for both programs will be English.  There will be 4 groups of 6 
students in each program with 8 teachers.  Materials: NYSESLAT Prep Books, ELA and Math Prep Books, Content Area Libraries, 
and supplies such as notebooks, folders, charts etc.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All required support services are for the appropriate grades and age for ELL students.  We use Earobics Software, Starfall, and 
Sound Blender, TPR, live objects and photographs to target beginner level students.  We teach vocabulary development 
exercises and reading and writing strategies to make the content comprehensible to support ELLS in content area instruction in 
Science and Social studies.   We also use Story Writer Deluxe which assists Intermediate and Advanced level students in 
creating their own literature. We use the Brain Pop internet program and text books in Spanish for Science and Social Studies 
in the TBE classes for Native language support.  We use K-5 appropriate literature translated in Spanish for the beginner 
students who need native language support.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Native language support is systematic.  We  provide support in the ESL classroom- provided by the ESL teacher and in the form 
of glossaries, dictionaries, and materials in the native languages represented by ELLs.  In addition, school personnel who can 
provide support to students during the school day should be utilized to provide clarification for ELLs (in their native languages) 
who may be struggling with content and concepts in their subject-area classes. We group students  of the same language for 
certain activities so that they can assist each other and respond in their native language. We also extend these strategies to 
after and before school programs as well as summer school.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  All required support services are for the appropriate grades and age for ELL students.  We use Earobics Software, Starfall, and 
Sound Blender, TPR, live objects and photographs to target beginner level students.  We teach vocabulary development 
exercises and reading and writing strategies to make the content comprehensible to support ELLS in content area instruction in 
Science and Social studies.   We also use Story Writer Deluxe which assists Intermediate and Advanced level students in 
creating their own literature. We use the Brain Pop internet program and text books in Spanish for Science and Social Studies 
in the TBE classes for Native language support.  We use K-5 appropriate literature translated in Spanish for the beginner 
students who need native language support.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All required support services are for the appropriate grades and age for ELL students.  We use Earobics Software, Starfall, and 
Sound Blender, TPR, live objects and photographs to target beginner level students.  We teach vocabulary development 
exercises and reading and writing strategies to make the content comprehensible to support ELLS in content area instruction in 
Science and Social studies.   We also use Story Writer Deluxe which assists Intermediate and Advanced level students in

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We provide the following as supports to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the start of the school year: Every child is 
given a suggested reading and writing assignment for their specific grade level to help acclimate them to the work level and 
schedule within their age and grade.  We also have informational sessions on the ELL Programs, and the Assessments that the 
students in their grade will be required and prepared to take during that school year.  We provide additional after school 
program support information so that the parents have knowledge of many options for learning assistance at the school.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

When the school creates groups for Inquiry / extended day use data in order to form these groups and provide targeted 
interventions that address the needs of these students- we provide the students guided reading support and vocabulary 
development skills based on their reading levels and NYSESLAT scores.    The ESL program provides targeted interventions for 
ELLS in both reading, writing, for the ELA/ NYSESLAT results.  The Bilingual teacher provides her students with ELA/ NYSESLAT 
preparation programs as well as afterschool opportunities in Spanish.  All other ELLs receive ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT 
preparation in English after school opportunities.  Our school uses Wilson and Fundations reading programs,  Words Their Way 
phonics program, the Treasure Chest ESL Literacy Program and Earobics software in English and Imagine Learning English a 
technology based language acquisition program for ELL student depending on their on the guided reading group and writing 
group level as per Fountas and Pinnell and their LAB-R / NYSESLAT results.  Students who reach proficiency levels on the 
NYSESLAT after two years of continued ESL services are given the opportunity to receive monolingual classes in both reading 
and mathematics.  In addition, opportunities are given to these students to act as a buddy / peer tutor to other students. The 
ELL teacher ensures that students receive  ELL testing accommodations; it is ensured that former ELLs participate in the 
school’s supplemental ELL programs if the activities would further benefit the language development of participating 
students.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 Not applicable for our school because we do not have Dual Language programs.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 1.) ELL teachers are given a professional growth opportunity plan: (PGO).  Opportunities for intervistation, smart board 
training, instructional rounds walks, instructional work shops and study groups are the examples of professional development 
opportunites at Community School 300. 
2.)  Professional development opportunities for Ready Gen and Go Mathematics, Fountas and Pinnell and training in the Units 
of Study. 
3.)  Saturday program opportunities, activities and clubs for students. 
  
4.) Our school administrators provide for flexible scheduling opportunities.  Our ESL teacher plans with grades teams during 
weekly common planning times as well as weekly common planning time for all special education teachers.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Our school administrators provide for flexible scheduling opportunities.  Our ESL teacher plans with grades teams during 
weekly common planning times as well as weekly common planning time for all special education teachers.    
    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our Pupil Accounting Secretary, ESL teacher and Parent Coordinator conduct a parent orientation session for families which 
details information about our school, curriculum and instruction and ESL /ELL programs offered at our school. In addition, this 
process occurs weekly as new students register throughout the year.   Our ESL Team facilitates the HLIS and the parents and 
child are interviewed immediately.  If the school can not provide the translation at our school, we inform school 
administrators, who arrange for the translation services and subsequent interview in the home language.  If LAB-R eligible, 
then the student is administered the LAB- R; if they score below proficient, the ELL teacher issues an Entitlement Letter 
addressed to the parent with the child.    In the Entitlement letter, the parents are invited to the Parent Orientation session 
within ten days of their child's admission to the school.   During Parent Orientation session, the parents view a video about ESL 
education and are then provided with the Parent Survey and Selection forms to be completed at the time of the meeting.  If 
the parent chooses to fill it out at home, the ELL teacher provides a due date for the form to be returned.  After the date has 
passed, the ELL teacher calls the home to remind the parents that the form needs to be returned by a specific date. The ELL 
teacher, continues to outreach to families about our ESL programs throughout the school year. 
  
  
  
     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Venessa Singleton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies we use to assess our Community School 300 X written and oral interpretation needs 
to ensure all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand is 
as follows: CS300X provides and collects from newly registered parents; Home Language Identification Survey 
(HLIS) and emergency contact information card. In Part 3, Questions 1 and 2, of the HLIS, the parents are asked 
the following questions-1. "In what language would you like to receive written information from the school?" 
Also, question: 2. "In what language would you prefer to communicate orally with the school staff?" In addition, 
on the emergency contact information card, parents are asked to identify and write on the emergency contact 
information card their “preferred language of communication” in written and or oral communication. The Pupil 
Accounting Secretary, English as a Second Language Coordinator as well as the Parent Coordinator, keep records 
of this information in the Home Language Report (RHLA). According to the data compiled on the RHLA for the 
whole school, we have discerned that that our school requires written translation and oral interpretation needs in 
Spanish, Soninke and French and Hausa. The family needs break down of languages are as follows:- 149 out of a 
total of 604 students or 25 percent of parents require Spanish translation; the parents of 9 students of a total of 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             64 

 

the parents of 604 or less than 1 percent of our parents need translation in Soninke. In addition, less that .05 
percent requires translation in French, Hausa and Fulani. At the time of registration at C. S. 300, families complete 
Home Identification Language Surveys, ESL Coordinator, Pupil Accounting Secretary and Parent Coordinator work 
with potential families and our Parent Coordinator provides families with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and 
Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation service in their native 
language at our school and our school needs assessment survey. Pedagogues also interview the parents about 
what their language translation and interpretation needs are. The current structures in place for sharing these 
finding with this school community are as follows: first we notify the parents of incoming students during parent 
orientations sessions at through out the year that we provide translation and interpretation services for them. In 
addition, we also notify the teachers of the students who need these translation services in their particular classes 
so that all communications- written correspondences and oral communications are translated in those languages 
and given to the students whose families we have identified as needing these services.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
