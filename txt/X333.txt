Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement-  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The PS333X community constituted by our community leaders, school district, school leadership, teacher teams, and 
families work hand and hand to cultivate lifelong learners who are college and career ready. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our core values are made up of three words that are managed by every member of our educational community. 
"Learn, Apply, Assess" These words guide our vision, projects, plans and structures.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Longwood Academy of Discovery is an Pre-Kindergarten - fifth grade elementary school located in the Bronx. Our 
student population is approximately 75% Hispanic, 22% Black, and 2% White. 54% of the students are boys and 46% 
of the students are girls. The special education population is 22%. Our English Language Learner population is 24%. 
We have approximately 41% of our population who are students living in temporary housing (STH). 100% of our 
students are eligible for Title 1 funding. 

We are committed to provide rigorous instruction that is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards with a 
focus on structures and routines that support small group work. This year, we will continue with Teacher's College 
Reading and Writing in grades K-5. In math we will implement a Envisions, a program that is new to our school but we 
feel supports our goal of developing students problem solving skills. We will continue with Passport to Social Studies 
for our social studies curriculum but will implement a new science curriculum, Amplify Science. will be the Pre-
Kindergarten will continue to use the New York City Department of Education Early Childhood Units of Study. We will 
continue to provide teachers in house coaching support with our K-2 ULIT Coach, 3-5 Literacy Coach, and K-5 Math 
coach.  

We are working in partnership with other institutions such as Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, EMPIRE, 
and Spoons Across America to work towards meeting our goals this year.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The special education population is 22%. Our English Language Learner population is 24%. We have approximately 
41% of our population who are students living in temporary housing (STH). 100% of our students are eligible for Title 1 
funding. 

Our targeted populations which we will focus on throughout this upcoming year include the English Language 
Learners, Students with Individual Education Plans and the Lowest One-Third. We will monitor their performance and 
progress through pre and post assessments, Fountas and Pinnell running records, Measures of Student Learning 
Assessments, projects, NYSESLAT, ELA and Math Tests. Since these populations require additional instructional 
support and encouragement. We have AIS teachers that will also support some of the highest need students. We will 
also continue with our after school instructional programs that are designed to support struggling students.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Some of The Longwood Academy for Discovery's current strengths are the the development of teacher teams, an 
atmosphere of consistent professional development, the incorporation of new technology, curriculum revisions and 
positive behavioral interventions and support.  

According to daily observations, data from meetings and feedback, one of our challenges is improving the parent 
school connection. We are currently working with the new Parent Association, the parent coordinator, teachers, the 
secretaries, family worker, social worker and guidance counselor to educate parents and support them in the 
importance of their involvement in their children's education.  

Within The Framework for Great Schools, we have made significant progress in Trust, Collaboration, Supportive 
Environment, and Effective Leadership Teams. We will be focusing our efforts more on Student Achievement, Home 
Connection and Rigorous Instruction in order to achieve our goals for 2018-2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
**Focus on Math data to align with instructional Focus 

 

Last school year our school used GoMath as our primary math program. State scores showed that students lacked a 
conceptual understanding of problem solving. We researched different mathematical curricula and selected EnVision 
Math for its clear and concise focus on problem solving and fluency. 

 

Although test scores increased in Math, we still have a large percentage of students scoring below grade level on New 
York State Math tests. Math data, conversations with teachers and coaches reveal that students struggle with 
problem solving. They also struggle with unpacking word problems. Math benchmark assessments indicate that 
students require intensive support around key components (problem solving and fluency) that can be applied to all 
math strands. *Analysis will be done throughout the year based on EnVision Math End-of-Unit exams and 
performance based assessments.*  

 

Beyond curriculum, conversations with teachers as well as formal (MOTP) data collected from teachers revealed that 
teachers are interested in and require more support with respect to math problem solving with a focus on supporting 
struggling students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all classroom teachers will implement math instructional strategies targeting problem solving resulting 
in 60% of all students scoring a level 3 or higher as measured on EnVision Math end of unit assessments.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Support for teachers that struggle with problems solving and 
fluency strategies.  

In-house Math Coach, as well as, EnVision Math consultants will 
support teachers with on-site Professional Learning. Strategies 
will be provided to deepen student conceptual understanding 
problem solving.  

Math Coach will work with teachers to ensure classrooms 
support student independence and ensure students are able to 
work productively during independent time. (i.e. classroom 
setup, rituals, routines, visual timers, etc.)  

To ensure teachers are able to maximize learning time in the 
classroom we are working to foster a positive classroom 
environment through PBIS.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Analysis of the NYC DOE School Quality Guide, indicates that the school is a safe place for children to learn. (See data 
below)  

  100% of teachers agree or strongly agree that students are safe in their classrooms.  
  96% of teachers agree or strongly agree that students are safe in the hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms and 

cafeteria.  

However, many teachers indicate some struggles with respect to classroom management and ensuring that students 
are focused on learning. This is something that administration and coaches have noticed as well. Strong classroom 
management, structures and routines play such a vital role in ensuring students are able to focus on learning. (See 
data below)  

  81% of teachers responded that a lot of or all of the students follow rules in the classroom 
  56% of teachers responded that a lot of all of the students in their classes pay attention when they are 

supposed to 

  70% of teachers responded that a lot of or all of the students in their classes do their work when they're 

supposed to 

  52% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes behave well in class even when the 

teacher isn't watching 

  77% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults in their school recognize disruptive behavior as social-

emotional learning opportunities  

  67% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults in their school have access to school based supports  

We have been working with a Culture and Climate Specialist, who spent the past year working one-on-one with 
teachers to create a positive learning environment. This year, with the consolidation, we are taking a whole-school 
approach. Ms. Bond will work with a Culture and Climate Committee as well as the PBIS Committee to create strong 
foundation school-wide  

 

Ms. Bond met with teachers from both schools on June 8th to talk about creating a strong classroom learning 
environment, working with teachers to develop strong classroom structure and routines that support positive 
learning environment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

P.S. 333 ensures that teachers have at least one common prep period per week and teachers are committed to their 
students' improvement. We have focused on creating systems and routines for teachers when meeting as a grade 
team. Feedback from the QR and PPO indicate that these systems have been working and teachers are frequently 
meeting and talking about student work, however we noticed that while teachers are meeting, they struggle with 
documenting these meeting and this impacts follow through on some of the work they do. Via informal conversations 
with teachers and observations by the administration, we noted that although the majority of teachers are committed 
success and improvement in their classroom they would benefit from more structured collaborative teacher time in 
order to improve student performance. This year, we will continue support teachers more directly as they continue 
with the structures that have been in place. Similarly, we have identified a need to provide structures that will allow 
the teacher teams to continue to work together and focus on documenting and following through with the action 
plans created when they discuss units and student progress and differentiated professional development for teachers.  

Additionally, our PD team will continue with the PD Schedule that allows teachers to alternate Monday PD between 
working in grade teams and differentiated PLCs (Professional Learning Communities). This will ensure that teachers 
receive the professional learning they need to improve their craft as well as quality time with their grade teams where 
they can focus on curriculum development and supporting all students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, PS 333 will provide structure and support for all teachers to maximize and enhance their time working 
collaboratively with an inquiry lens to improve academic achievement as evidenced by bi-monthly teacher team 
meetings resulting in units and small group work that meet the need of our students.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34

State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 333 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 333 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
The purpose of our program is to increase and enhance the academic language and skills of our 
English language learners. Using ENL methodologies, the students will strengthen their English 
skills in the 4 language strands: listening, speaking, reading and writing thereby accelerating 
their overall academic achievement. Scaffold instruction will include looking closely at reading 
texts, note taking, use of graphic organizers, sentence starters, listening to conversations/lessons, 
guided reading and writing. Students will also utilize the software program Imagine Learning 
which matches students to their academic English abilities and track their progress. Please note 
the Imagine Learning software program will be at no cost to the Title 3 program. Teachers will 
utilize this data to plan and analyze accordingly. Starting on December 12, 2018 the certified 
Bilingual teachers, Ms. Meneses, Ms. Denvir, Ms. Martinez and Mrs. Calzado will be running 
the title 3 after school program along with Mrs. Pacheco, the ENL Coordinator. According to our 
EDAT history report, 36 out of 70 ELL students in grades 1-5 fall in the language proficiency 
level as transitioning, and 34 out of 70 fall in the language proficiency level of expanding. 
Therefore, we will invite and serve 70 ELL students in grades 1 through 5 who are at the 
proficiency levels of transitioning, and expanding. The program is schedule to run from 
December 12, 2018 until March 28, 2019. A total of 28 sessions. Students will meet every 
Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30pm to 4:30pm. Teachers will also plan for 1 hour every 
Friday for a total of 14 sessions. The instruction of focus will be writing. However, if students 
need support in understanding directions in English teachers will either speak in Spanish or 
utilize google translate to help translate directions in the student's native language. Teachers will 
begin the program by analyzing EDAT data, looking at curriculum, planning pacing guides and 
reviewing schedules for the after school program. Every Friday from 2:30pm to 3:30pm teachers 
will also receive professional development. The teachers will guide their planning by formal and 
informal data. Such as weekly and monthly data reports that are provided by the Imagine 
Learning program. Other forms of data include the Fountas and Pinell results. In addition, we 
will also provide professional development from an ELL consultant at this time it will be our 
ELL network support field center specialist assigned by Kristy DeLaCruz. All teachers of ELL 
students will also be invited to attend. Teachers that will attend include Ms. Barbosa, Mrs. 
Fillipi, Ms. Denvir, Dr. Valenzuela, Mrs. Pacheco, Ms. Perdomo,  Ms. Martinez, Mrs. Rivera, 
Ms. Calzado, Ms. Acosta, Ms. Meneses, Ms. Fews, Ms. Angenor,Mrs. Quinones, Ms. 
Sangosse,  Mrs. Schury, Ms. Camacho, and Ms. Suarez. Topics will include looking at language 
progressions to help us meet CCSS, scaffolding vocabulary, analyzing and evaluating student 
writing on the NYSESLAT, teaching academic language, understanding the writing process and 
incorporating ESL strategies. Mrs. Martinez will work with grade 1, Ms. Meneses will work with 
grades 3/4, Ms. Denvir will work with grades 2 and Mrs. Calzado will work with grade 5. They 
will have about 18 students each. Mrs. Pacheco will work with the parent ESL class. Teachers 
will work with the materials: Imagine Learning and the supplemental program, NY ELLs from 
Continental Press. Please note, we will use title 3 funds to purchase the supplementary program 
NY ELLs only. Title 3 funds will not be utilized to purchase the Imagine Learning program. 
Mrs. Pacheco will utilize the adult ESL program, Future English for Results from the company 
Pearson. Our school aide, Julissa Pena, will be in charge of taking attendance and providing

in the Title 3 program will begin the program by analyzing data, looking at curriculum, planning 
pacing guides and reviewing schedules for the after school program. Teachers who are 
participating in the Title 3 program will also meet every Friday from 2:30pm to 3:30pm and 
receive professional development on analyzing student work, evaluating nyseslat simulations and 
interim assessments. This will guide their planning. They will also meet to learn 
best ENL practices. A total of 14 sessions. They will discuss the logistics of the after school 
program, create pacing guides using the curriculum, develop lesson plans and review 
the schedule. These teachers will also receive professional development on analyzing 
EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool), language progressions, targets of measurements, student 
work, evaluating NYSESLAT simulations and interim assessments. This will guide their 
planning.  Throughout these PDs they will  learn best ENL strategies. The teachers will guide 
their planning by formal and informal data such as weekly and monthly data reports that are 
provided by the Imagine Learning program. Other forms of data will include the Fountas and 
Pinell results. In addition, we will also provide professional development from our district and 
borough field support center, ELL specialist, assigned by Ms. Kritsty DeLaCruz. All teachers of

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Based on our school population 86% of our students come from a home in which English is the 
second language spoken. Therefore, the parents of those students who will be participating in the 
Title 3 program will be invited to attend the ESL adult class from December 4, 2018 through 
March 22, 2019, from 2:30pm to 4:30pm-a total of 28 sessions. The goal is to increase English 
conversational, reading comprehension  and writing skills, increase parent involvement and have 
the parents become part of the after school program, alongside their child.  Topics during the 
ESL adult program will include English social/communication skills, the writing process, and 
strategies and skills to improve reading comprehension. Parents will be invited in their native 
language via email, telephone calls or in writing to attend other parent workshops that the school 
offers such as an overview and  breakdown of the NYSESLAT, ways to best support your child 
with Math and English Language Arts. These workshops will be conducted in house by Mrs. 
Pacheco-ELL Coordinator, Mrs. Mirdita- literacy coaches, our Parent Coordinator Luz Gerena 
and other invited guests. These workshops will  be offered during the Tuesday parent 
engagement time and other after school functions throughout the school year. These workshops 
will be at no cost to the Title 3 funds. If translation is needed for the notifications of events 
translation services through the Board of Education will be solicited.   Mrs. Pacheco the ENL 
coordinator will maintain attendance records as well as agendas and invitations/notifications of 
events. The school will complement the cost of the parent program using other funding sources.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 At P.S.333, we  use Fountas and Pinnell early literacy assessments such as letter/sound recognition in English to assess ELLs in 
grades K-5. Students whose native language is Spanish are also given Fountas and Pinnell early literacy assessments in Spanish. 
The English NYSITELL and the Spanish Lab-r are also administered for students who are eligible for NYSITELL testing. It also 
helps us get a picture of an ELL's early literacy skills. ELLs also have 3 writing benchmarks: Performance tasks per year. 
Teachers utilize rubrics to help assess needs/levels. Teachers also utilize, Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project letter 
and sound recognition, sight words assessments. We administer pre and post unit exams to see how much the students have 
grown in their literacy skills.  Every unit ends in a culminating projects were students work has been assessed through rubrics. 
In the transitional Bilingual classrooms, in grades Kinder and 3rd, teachers also utilized the Spanish Fountas and Pinnel literacy 
assessment system and the Estrellitas benchmarks to determine literacy skills in Spanish as well as to help the teachers form

groups. These assessments show us that our ELLs need phonics instruction that highlights letter sound relations, word families, 
initial blends, and rhymes.  We also value informal assessments such as conferencing, and guided group notes. We incorporate 
chants, songs, rhymes in our everyday instruction.We use these data to plan the instruction, and  to identify students who 
need extra support and intervention. Teachers also use the data to inform  their grouping of the ELLs. The data also help the 
teachers design lesson plans to differentiate for all language needs.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support our teachers to use assessment data and plan effectively we have allotted time in our weekly schedule that 
allow teachers to plan with their grade and their ENL providers. We also have created a google email account which provides 
ENL teachers and ENL providers resources that they need to plan accordingly, such as ENL strategies, Language progressions, 
TOMS, etc. Teachers can also chat and edit lessons, and  curriculum through google drive. Curriculum teams, which include 
ENL providers meet regularly to revise/edit current curriculum.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 The school evaluates the success of the ELL program by reviewing the Rlat and EDAT Data.The school also discusses current 
ELL programs and makes adjustments to programs during our instructional leadership meetings. The team looks at the result 
of periodic assessements and baselines assessments to see the success of the programs for ELLs. For example, this year we will 
also continue to utilize the Fountas and Pinnell Spanish system to evaluate reading and writing skills. We also continue to 
utilize the Imagine Learning software programas we have seen through periodic progress reports that our ELLs have made 
gains. We use the Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT program since more than 55% of our ELLs made progress in the NYSESLAT 
levels.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Currently our school has 2 teams (Child study and SIT) which includes school administrators, school psychologist, counselors, 
SETTS, IEP teacher, ELA and Math coaches, AIS teachers and ENL coordinator/ENL providers.These teams gather on a weekly 
basis and review data and teacher concerns.The team then decides which interventions the students can receive apart from 
their ENL services. Interventions can include AIS in class or small group. If child need counseling services the team makes 
arrangements with the family to consider in house services from Astor Services. ENL providers and ENL/TBE teachers also 
gather on a weekly basis to look at data and discuss further interventions. Such interventions can also include SETTS and 
S.P.I.R.E 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
For each English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance on the annual English language 
proficiency assessment, the school leadership team and child study team determines additional support services to provide 
the student, taking into consideration evidence such as the following:  
• Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program  
• English and home language literacy  
• Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE)  
• English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs  
• Results on the annual English language proficiency assessment exam  
• Bilingual education or English as a second language teacher recommendations  
• Parent or guardian request  
• Sample of student work in English and, if possible, in the home language  
At P.S. 333, we also use the NY  state ELA and Math test results, periodic assessments, NYSESLAT scores, running 
records:Fountas and Pinnell, student IEPs,  performance tasks, benchmarks,  unit exams  in order to track  ELLs' progress. We 
offer RTI at three levels. TIER 1,  TIER 2. TIER 3.  We have two ongoing RTI teams at our school: Child study team and Student 
Implementation team.  At TIER 1, Before students are referred to the intervention teams, teachers  collect data and anecdotals 
about the progress of the child. Teachers provide the necessary intervention in the classroom. If progress is below grade 
expectations, they then refer the child to the intervention teams along with all the data and anecdotals. The classroom

teacher, the ENL teachers and other support staff work together to identify the needs and the services required to help the 
ELLs during meetings. The child study team focuses on ELLs in general education. For our  ELL students in Special Education 
classrooms we have our SIT or, Student Implementation team. At TIER 2,  ENL, AIS, school psychologist and SETTS teacher pulls 
out the students who need TIER 2 services and provide small group instruction in  guided reading, writing and math in grades 
3-5. At Tier 3,  AIS, ENL teachers, Pre K teacher and the SETTs teacher work one on one with the students who need more 
intensive intervention. Continuous progress monitoring is done on a 6 week interval to track student progress. At TIER 3, we 
provide intervention services as needed.This year we also have a S.P.I.R.E. (Specialize Program Individualizing Reading 
Excellence) which is a TIER 3 intervention program at our school which students meet with the teacher 3 to 4 times a week, 
either 1 to 1 or up to 3 students. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to the RLAT report, which details NYSESLAT results and details the modalities or performance levels of our ELLs are 
as follow: In first grade,5 (entering), 5 (emerging), 5 (transitioning) and 9 (expanding). In second grade, 1 (entering), 6 
(emerging), 13 (transitioning), 2 (expanding). In third grade, 4 (entering), 3 (emerging), 7 (transitioning), and 13 (expanding). In 
fourth grade, 2 (entering), 4 (emerging), 10 (transitioning), 12 (expanding). In fifth grade, 3 (entering), 4 (emerging), 4 
(transitioning), 7 (expanding). The NYSITELL data reveals that in kindergarten (June 1st) students coming to our school are 
performing at the transitional level. According to the NYSITELL results the modalities or performance levels are as follow: In 
Kindergarten we have 5 (entering), 2 (emerging), 5 (transitioning), 7 (expanding). This data shows us that the mayority of our 
ELLs are in the transitioning and expanding) levels. We also noticed that these particular levels transitioning and advanced 
varied across the grades.  Based on this data ENL providers will use NYSITELL and NYSESLAT conversion charts provided by the 
State to determine area of language proficiency in all modalities and needs. They will share results and linguistic needs with 
each grade team they service. This will help ENL providers and teachers to inform their programs, goals, planning and 
grouping. ENL providers also analyze the EDAT report and share the following information for teachers: which students are 
long term ELLs, which students have made progress or have remained in the same proficiency level, what are the linguistic 
needs of the student, which students have been flagged for specific reasons (holdovers, attendance issues ect.). This tool help 
both teachers and providers plan and group accordingly.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The following structures are in place to disseminate the ENL findings: The ENL providers will use and analyze the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT conversion charts, provided by the State, to determine language proficiency needs for each modality (listening, 
speaking, reading and writing) along with the RLAT and EDAT tools to identify language needs of each ELL. This will help ENL 
providers and teachers adjust their programs to meet these needs. The EDAT report will also help us identify those students 
who have made gains or have made little to no movement in the NYSESLAT. We will also be able to identify which students 
have been flagged for a particular reason(s). For example, an ELL student that is a holdover or a long term ELL or a has an 
attendance problem. Using the data, ENL providers will present and share these findings for their particular grade. The data 
will also be made available at our school gmail account/drive so that the whole school community is aware.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In the freestanding ENL Program : ELLs at entering and emerging levels receive 360 minutes per week of 2 units of 
study in ENL, 1 unit of study in ENL stand alone (pull out with ENL providers) and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA. For 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

Emerging students .5 unit of study for stand alone services will be provided. .5 unit of study can be stand alone ENL or 
intergrated ENL/content area. Students who are at the transitioning level receive 180 minutes per week of 1 unit of 
study in ENL, .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA. .5 unit of study can be stand alone or intergrated ENL/content area. For 
expanding, ELLs receive 180 minutes per week of 1 unit of study of ENL, 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA or other content 
area. For commanding ELLs students receive services for 2 years. .5 unit of study per week of integrated ENL in ELA or 
content area. During the intergrated model ENL providers will be working with small groups with their classroom 
teachers, During the stand alone ENL providers will pull out small groups and provide services in their assign 
classroom. H. E. S. (Hearing Education Services) ENL students are banned by grade K/1, 2/3 and 4/5. ENL provider will 
also pull out and service these students according to their grade.  In grade 5, we have a self contained ENL class. This 
group is heterogeneous and includes all mixed levels. The classroom teacher will deliver all instruction using ENL 
strategies to meet the needs of her ELLs.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

  In TBE Spanish programs in grade K (grouped heterogeneously), students transfer home language skills to English by 
spending instructional time primarily in the home language before steadily transitioning to English. At the 
beginning/entering level, TBE students are expected to receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in 
English. As a student’s English proficiency increases, more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English, 
25% home language is use by the end of the school year. In TBE programs, teachers must make several considerations 
when determining which language is best to teach certain concepts. Teachers must consider carefully the intellectual 
demand of concepts, student familiarity with concepts. For entering and emerging students 1 unit of study for ENL 
(English as New Language) instruction, 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA instruction which is a total of 360 minutes per week. 
ALso it must include, 1 unit of study in Home language arts (HLA) and a minimum of 2 units of study for bilingual 
content are subjects. For students in transitioning and expanding receive 180 minutes per week of ENL. .5 unit of 
study in ENL/ELA. .5 unit of study can be stand alone ENL or intergraded ENL/content area. It must include 1 HLA class 
and a minimum of 1 unit of study of bilingual content area subjects.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           At P.S. 333, we have 1 bilingual transitional class (Kinder) and ENL integrated push in and stand alone (pull out) programs 
in grades K-5. ELLs in a bilingual class receive ENL services from their bilingual certified classroom teacher. ELLs  in a regular 
classroom receive the following services: ELLs at the entering and Emerging levels students receive 360 minutes per week of 2 
units of study in ENL (English as a New Language), 1 unit of study in ENL stand alone (pull out) and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA. 
For Emerging students .5 unit of study for stand alone services will be provided. .5 unit of study can be stand alone ENL or 
integrated ENL/content area. Students who are at the transitioning level receive 180 minutes per week of 1 unit of study in 
ENL, .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA. .5 unit of study can be stand alone or integrated ENL/content area. For expanding, ELLs 
receive 180 minutes per week of 1 unit of study of ENL, 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA or other content area. For 
commanding, ELLs students receive services and accommodations for 2 years. .5 unit of study per week of integrated ENL in 
ELA or content area.   In a Bilingual classroom, ELLs receive the following services: For entering and emerging students 1 unit of 
study for ENL (English as New Language) instruction, 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA instruction which is a total of 360 minutes per 
week. Also, it must include, 1 unit of study in Home language arts (HLA) and a minimum of 2 units of study for bilingual content 
are subjects. For students in transitioning and expanding receive 180 minutes per week of ENL. .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA. .5 
unit of study can be stand alone ENL or intergraded ENL/content area. It must include 1 HLA class and a minimum of 1 unit of 
study of bilingual content area subjects.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

   In our freestanding ENL program and in Transitional bilingual program: ENL and Bilingual teachers make content 
comprehensible using scaffolding strategies such as project based lessons, explicit vocabulary teaching, building background 
knowledge, giving students sentence starters, use of visuals and realia, use of technology, grouping, accountable 
'talk'/discussions, use of manipulatives, etc. Teachers include language objectives as well as content goals in their lessons. In 
the Transitional Bilingual Program instruction is provided in Spanish and in English. Teachers model, practice with students and 
confers with individual students. Teachers use either English or Spanish to build a ladder of complexity for our ELLs to meet the 
demands of the Common Core Standards. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Once a student is identified as an ELL, several evaluations take place. ELLs in our Transitional Bilingual program and ENL 
program are given the assessment, Fountas and Pinnell in English. In the TBE the Fountas and Pinnell assessment is given in 
English and Spanish 4 times a during the school. Estrellita benchmarks are also utilized to form goals, and groups (grade K).The 
estrellita program also has ongoing assessments throughout the school year. At the beginning and at the end of the school 
year students have to take benchmarks created by the NYC teachers in either English or Spanish. Math assessments are 
provided to the students either in English or Spanish. For grades 3-5, ELA, and Science state exams are offered in both English 
and Spanish. Students are also always given the option to respond, summarize in their choice of language.  Students are also 
provided translators during the Math and Science state exams (Arabic/Bengali).  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 a. Currently, we have 1 SIFE students in 4  th grade H.E.S. (Hearing Education Services, 12:1:1).  We currently have 
an ASL teacher and speech teacher working with these students as well as the ENL provider.  
b. For our newcomers  we provide ENL services to newcomer students as well as helping them adjust to school life and their 
life in New York.  We utilize a program, In the USA for these new comers. 
c. For developing ELLs, we provide ENL services which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions such as guided reading, small 
group instruction-AIS, Pull-Out intervention, and Title 3 after-school program.  For those students who still do not make 
progress, we always come up with a plan of action involving teachers and family during the Child Study meetings.    
d. Currently we have no long term ELLs. However, if we were to receive a student who is a long term ELL our  school will 
submitt the name to the Child Study team. The team which consist of administrators, psychologist, counselors, AIS, IEP, 
SETTS and ENL providers will create a plan for these children. They will receive the mandated ENL services. If they have 
an IEP they will continue to receive additional services per their IEP goals and their names will be submitted to the SITS team 
and the team will provide next steps of intervention.   Technology will be used through laptops and the Smart Board to aid 
them and receive a license to utilize the program, Imagine Learning.  They will be enrolled in extended day and the ESL 
Imagine learning after-school program as additional intervention.  Their parents will also be targeted for workshops and 
invited to participate in the Imagine Learning literacy after-school program. 
e. Teachers of the former ELLs after 2 years of exiting ELL status receive ESL services for 90 minutes. Currently we have 6 
students. Classroom teachers are encouraged and receive training in utilizing scaffold strategies for effective instruction to 
meet the needs of former ELLs. They are provided with picture dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries. Teachers are encouraged to 
teach vocabulary explicitly and build academic language.  Teachers are encouraged to utilize CCS language and speaking 
standards and language progressions to develop a more structured approach in terms of second language acquisition. The 
former ELLs are also provided with time and setting accommodations during state exams.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Teachers of students who are ELLs and SWDs utiize either the Fundations or Wilson program to provide an enriched content. 
Teachers also utilize and embed the ENL scaffolds to provide access to the Teacher's College Reading and Writing program. ENL 
providers also use the Reach-language vocabulary program and NY ELLs to further support the academic progress of these 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

students. Teachers also meet in inquiry teams, on a weekly basis to monitor progress and make adjustments accordingly to 
curriculum and planning. Many of these ELLs are also mainstreamed into a general educational setting during the school day to 
provide them with the opportunity for further rigor.Teachers and specialized (cluster teachers) utilize ENL scaffold strategies to 
provide students with accessibility to all content. Teachers utilize Common Core speaking and language standards in their 
planning. Specific strategies such as accountable talk and the use of sentence starters are utilized to enhance learning. 
Teachers use technology and listening centers to enhance listening and speaking language abilities. Teachers also utilize 
picture dictionaries, the frayer model,  or other graphic organizers to scaffold reading and writing learning.          
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 We have ICT classes in grades K-5 that is taught by a Special Education Teacher and a General Education Teacher. This 
provides a less restrictive environment where ELLs with disabilities improve their English Language skills. The ENL providers 
pushes in and out to provide services for those students. Teachers provide best practices to meet the needs of ELLs and SWDs. 
These practices include scaffolding lessons to provide accessibility to complex text, the use of visuals, technology, realia, 
graphic organizers, and many ESL strategies.  ENL providers and classroom teachers utilize the language progressions to plan 
effective curriculum and lessons that meet the needs of ELL-SWDs when co teaching. ENL providers meet and plan with their 
co-teachers during grade meetings on a weekly basis.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Currently, we have several intervention programs that target our ELL population in all grades. Mrs. Caban services grades K-2, 
for grades 3-5 Mrs. Mirdita literacy Coach/AIS teacher and Ms. Kirk works with our ENL and Bilingual students. Ms. Caban 
works with students who are at an transitioning and advance proficiency level and are being categorized as "At Risk." Mrs. 
Caban, services these students several times a week in a small group setting and once a week she pushes in to work with the 
whole class, which include new comers. Mrs. Caban also works with the 2nd grade ELLs that are at transitioning or advanced 
proficiency level. She pulls out these students twice a week. Mrs. Caban, Ms. Kirk and Mrs. Mirdita focus of instruction is 
guided reading and guided writing, as well as, phonics. All instruction is provided in English.  The schools SETTS teacher, 
provides services for ELA and Math for our ELLs in grades K-5. All ELLs are provided with the mandated minutes per IEP. The 
SETTS teacher offers a wide range of interventions for ELA and Math in both English and Spanish. Some of these include guided 
reading, shared reading and writing as well as phonics. ELLs in grades 3 to 5 also receive AIS through guided reading from Ms. 
Kirk, and Mrs. Mirdita work with all transitioning, advanced commanding students.  For TIER 3, we also have the SETTS teacher 
who is trained and provide services using the program S.P.I.K.E= Specialize Program Individualizing Reading Excellence. She 
provides 1 on 1 intervention 3-4 times a week for students at transitioning, expanding and commanding levels.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the registration trends and needs of our school community we have a opened a Bilingual kindergarten class. It will 
have 25 students.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

In September 2018 we will close the 4th grade Bilingual class. Currently we only have 14 students in TBE.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Every year (around December) we make sure P.S. 333x offers a Title 3 After School program for ELLs in which an effective ENL 
instruction is provided to prepare all ELL students for the ELA and NYSESLAT exams. Students get an opportunity to practice 
the skills expected on NYSESLAT testing.  ELLs are also invited to other after school programs Empire or Disney that aims to 
improve the ELA and Math Skills. If school meets and receive supplemental funds from the Title 3 Immigrant program our 
school also offers a Math after school program for Immigrants and ELLs who are new to our school. These programs are 
provided after school 2 days a week for 2 hours. A total of 30 sessions.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Newcomers utilize the program, 'In the USA ' in which they build language and vocabulary to adjust to their new school.The 
Fountas and Pinnell intervention reading program is also utilized for our newcomers.  
Computer Software such as, Imagine Learning, I-Ready, Starfalls, NY Public Library Tumblebooks,  Brainpop,  Peble 
Go,  Discovery Education  are utilized for instructional purposes for all of our ELLS. The REACH literacy program for ELLs and 
Getting ready for the NYSESLAT will also be utilized for all our ELLS. Go Math program (K-5), and  Teachers College: Reading 
and Writing  (grades K-5) is also being utilized for our ELLS.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

    In the freestanding ENL Program : ELLs at the entering and Emerging levels receive 360 minutes per week of 2 units of study 
in ENL, 1 unit of study in ENL stand alone (pull out) and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA. For Emerging students .5 unit of study for 
stand alone services will be provided. .5 unit of study can be stand alone ENL or intergrated ENL/content area. Students who 
are at the transitioning level receive 180 minutes per week of 1 unit of study in ENL, .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA. .5 unit of study 
can be stand alone or intergrated ENL/content area. For expanding, ELLs receive 180 minutes per week of 1 unit of study of 
ENL, 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA or other content area. For commanding ELL students receive ENL services for 2 years and also 
receive testing accommodations; 5 unit of study per week of integrated ENL in ELA or content area.  ENL teachers allows 
students to ask questions in their home language but answers the questions in English. Students are also encouraged to work 
with partners to help one another support their home language. Spanish level libraries are also available in classrooms. 
    In TBE Spanish programs in grades K, and 3 (grouped heterogeneously), students transfer home language skills to English by 
spending instructional time primarily in the home language before steadily transitioning to English. At the beginning/entering 
level, TBE students are expected to receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English. As a student’s 
English proficiency increases, more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English, 25% home language is use by the 
end of the school year. In TBE programs, teachers must make several considerations when determining which language is best 
to teach certain concepts. Teachers must consider carefully the intellectual demand of concepts, student familiarity with 
concepts. For entering and emerging students 1 unit of study for ENL (English as New Language) instruction, 1 unit of study in

Denvir ENL provider, Mr. Nathaniel Valenzuela ENL Provider and Mrs. Agueda Calzado) pulls out the newcomer ELLs  and uses 
the program, 'In the USA'  in order to help them learn basic language to survive in the first few weeks of the school year. 
Parent coordinator guides and offers help to the families in adjusting to their new life. Translation services and parent letters 
in other languages are utilized in order to communicate with these families. ENL teachers follow a pull out and/or push in 
model in order to better serve the new ELLs and orient the students to the school by providing survival English.

with our parents throughout the school year. Here parents get to hear what is happening in our school and how they can be 
part of the process. Parent also get to voice any concerns or suggestions they may have. The Parents of ELLs and Immigrants 
are also invited participate in the Title 3 after school ESL parent class. Here the parents have the opportunity to develop their 
English language skills. Parents attend the ESL class during the time the students are attending their after school program. 
Throughout the school year also our school parent association run several events for our school such as bake sales, photo days, 
book fairs, winter and spring dance, and field days.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a parent enters our school building to register a student, the school secretary makes contact with the 
Bilingual Coordinator or trained pedagogue to quickly identify whether a language interpretation/translation 
service is required. Language interpretations can be provided by the school or the translation and interpretation 
unit. Upon evaluation by the coordinator, she determines whether the parent need further assistance with 
translation and or oral interpretation. If the parent does not speak Spanish the office makes contact with the 
translation and interpretation unit for further assistance. The ENL coordinator, the parent coordinator and most 
of the staff in the main office speak Spanish; which is the major language spoken at our school. They translate or 
interpret any information to that parent in Spanish. According to our school data, the ATS reports, completed 
HILS: Language Surveys shows that Spanish is the major language at PS 333x. Any letters send from our school is 
also provided in English and Spanish. This year we have also provided HILS, ELL Parent and Program Agreement 
surveys in Mandarin, Bengali and Arabic. According to the RCPL report on ATS, the main language other than 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

English that is preferred at our school is Spanish 35.98%, Bengali 0.85%, Arabic 0.49%, Afrikaans 0.49%, Mandika 
0.12%, French 0.12%, Sonnike 0.12%, and TWI 0.12%. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Currently in our school we have 445 
students. According to the Home 
Language Report for our school student 
population consists of the following:  

• 250 English speaking students  

• 173 Spanish 1. French 1. French-
KHMER 

• 3 Mandinka 2. Fulani 2. Haitian Creole 

• 2 Soninke .1 Swahili 1.TWI 

. 7 Arabic .2 Wolof  

In order to meet the needs of the 
different types of languages the school 
utilizes translation and interpretation 
unit services provided by the DOE. The 
school also utilizes the language 
translation kit for parents to guide the 
school with providing the necessary 
support for our parents. 

The school community which includes 
administration, teachers and parent 
coordinator are aware of the language 
needs of our school via parent 
newletters and ats report findings that 
are discussed in committees.  

   

 

 

 

 

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

Mandika 0.12%, French 0.12%, Sonnike 0.12%, and TWI 0.12%.

Each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who requires language assistance services will receive 
a copy of the Bill 

of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. All written communication between the home and school is distributed in both 
English and Spanish. However, in special cases where the language is not English or Spanish we will utilize the 
resources-language translation and interpretation kit- that was provided by the Department of Education as much as 
possible to ensure that parents are notified about issues of safety and instruction in their Native Language. Copies of 
chancellor regulations A-663 will be made available to all staff and parents.
