Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission statement, written with input from all members of our staff, highlights our beliefs about children and 
learning. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

PS 230’s mission is to create self-directed, freethinking learners that will grow into independent members of our local 

and global community. 

Our unique community works together to establish a socially and emotionally secure environment. This allows 

children to feel confident to take risks in their learning. 

Standards-aligned curriculum is catered to individual learning styles and interests, constantly evolving based on our 

knowledge of students. 

Professional collaboration fosters inquiry in order to grow in our understanding of the art and science of teaching. 

Our goal is for students to continue their journey of learning with an appreciation and respect for diversity through 

the cultural exchanges experienced at PS 230. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 230 is a unique community that prides itself on our diversity. We serve pre-kindergarten through 5 th grade in the 
Kensington section of Brooklyn. We have approximately 1200 students that encompass 25 different languages and 
dialects. 

We have a rich Arts program supplemented from funding from our school events as well as our parents through 
contributions to our PTA. This provides Arts enrichment during the year with a music program from Ms. Suzi 
(Musician in Residency) in grades pre-k through 1st, Brooklyn Children’s Theater in 2nd and 3rd grades, storyboarding 
artists and Mark Morris in 4th grade, and Claymation artists in 5th grade. 

We partner with Singing Winds to provide cultural enrichment through various celebrations such as Day of the Dead, 
Bengali New Year, and Chinese New Year. Our PTA also offers enrichment after school through program such as 
Chess, Capoeira, Gardening, Crochet, Coding, and Band. We also offer programs on Saturdays for our 3rd -5th grades. 
We partner with New York Cares, which facilitates Robotics, Cooking, and Tennis on-site, all year. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have approximately 400 identified English and New Language students. Over 80% of our students speak another 
language at home and our community values and honors linguistic diversity. We offer push-in and pull out ENL 
servicing. In the Fall of 2017 we are starting a Dual Language Spanish program beginning in Kindergarten and 1st 
grade. In addition we offer ICT classes, approximately 2-3 per grade, SETSS, and 4 Self-Contained settings to meet the 
varying needs of our students with disabilities. We have a Gifted and Talented track that spans from Kindergarten 
through 5th grade. We pride ourselves on have a range of settings to meet all of the unique needs of our students.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

PS 230 has been accepted for a second year as being a host school for the Learning Partners Program. In the fall of 
2018 we will host two schools and focus on best instructional practices for diverse linguistic learners. Before we were 
a host school, we were a partner LPP school with MS 88 around academic conversation and how to best build a 
connection between an elementary school and the zoned middle school.  

PS 230 is a proud recipient of the Respect for All Designation award in 2018. This comes from our strong culture of 
learning, high expectations, and few behavioral issues. Our attendance for staff and students has consistently been 
above 96%. Students have exposure to the visual arts and music in their programs and through our residencies. We 
have increased our classroom to parent communication through monthly newsletters, open school opportunities and 
with our website. Our parent coordinator organizes opportunities for sustained parent and volunteer programs to 
support instruction and education of the community such as Reading Partners and crochet programs. In addition, we

hold monthly seminars to support parents in a series we call, “How To.” Topics range from how to ask questions at a 
parent conference to how to support your child in reading. 

Our challenges, or as we view them, learning opportunities, are varied. We have two buildings: our pre-k to 1 st 
grades are housed in our Lower School, and 2nd -5 th grades are in our Upper School. We work on increasing 
collaboration between teachers by bridging, maintaining, and building more opportunities for teachers to work 
together, across the buildings, in vertical teams. We also look for ways to build even stronger community ties through 
collaboration between the buildings on committees and events. We are continually learning and developing our 
strategies of teaching diverse learners through our examination of our teaching practices. We are revising and 
expanding our Language Objectives in all curriculum units as well as continuing our study of Universal Design for 
Learning in order to meet all students in their learning styles and needs. We follow the Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project which has grown our pedagogy in our literacy curriculum. We are also partners with Teachers College 
Inclusive Classroom Project (TCICP). TCICP works with our Special Education teachers in order to further our 
knowledge of diverse learners and the pedagogical practices to support our students. 

Growth & Area of Focus 

In the spring of 2016 year, PS 230 made growth in math performance as well as closing the achievement gap in 
English Language Arts and Mathematics. In ELA we have increased our students scoring a level 3 or 4 by 6%. This is 
based on the spring 2016 State scores as we are awaiting the final 2017 Scores. We’ve achieved our 2016 CEP goal of 
at least 85% of our students making one years reading growth in grade Kindergarten through 5th grade.  

In the 2018-2019 year, our area of focus continued to remain in ELA. We had an area of focus in how we are using 
assessments, both formative and summative, to drive our instruction and helped us create targeted instruction based 
on what students individually need. We are continuing this as our focus in all areas this year in order to help us 
increase the effectiveness of instruction in not only ELA, but maintain and grow in the area of math. We are 
continuing to focus on a tangible goal that is accessible for teachers and students through the reading goal of one 
years growth. 

We will use the area of focus to support the Principal Performance Observation feedback to focusing on the practice 
of inquiry among our grade level and vertical teacher teams. We will use our Monday Professional Development time 
to structure vertical and grade level teams to analyze data and create small group targeted instruction in order to 
individualize instruction for students based on need.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Analysis of the ELA overall data shows a growth of .23 points from 2014-2017.  

Approximately 45% of our student population is identified as English as a New Language students. 

Analysis of the 2017-2018 MOSL running records showed that an average of 90% of our students made one year’s 
growth in a reading level. This surpassed our previous goal of 85%. It also shows that approximately 30% of our 
students are reading at levels 1 & 2. 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 90% of our students will gain one year’s growth in their reading levels per their Fountas & Pinnell running 
record levels.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We have adopted the Social Emotional Curriculum of Responsive classroom over the last 3 years. This has resulted in 
the use of common language, school-wide norms, and common routines such as morning meetings and the use of 
chimes. In order to expand our practices around 'Supportive Environments', we decided to focus on the area of 
students feeling challenged by their teachers and peers. 

We used our School Quality Guide to analyze teacher feedback in order to think about the best next goals in creating 
supportive environments where students feel challenged by teachers and peers. The data revealed: 

  78 % of teachers say that students have to work hard to do well. 
  72% of teachers say that students respond to challenging test questions. 
  59% of teachers say that students respond to challenging questions in class. 
  68% of teachers say that students build on each others ideas during class discussions. 
  59% of teachers say that students use data or text references to support their ideas. 
  63% of teachers say that students provide constructive feedback to their peers and teachers. 

We think this shows that a low number of students feel that talk, conversation, and peer feedback is not an important 
part of their learning environment. We see that teachers do not see evidence of this in peer interactions in class. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will increase the number of teachers that say that students build on each others ideas during class 
by 10% as seen through the School Quality Guide and school based survey in order to increase academic conversation 
during lessons.

development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We have tried several formats for Monday Professional Development Days as well as opportunities for teachers to 
work together collaboratively. Our teachers have collaborated with vertical and horizontal teams as well as groups 
outside of the community through our work with TCRWP, TCICP, and Learning Partners. Our goal is for our teachers to 
answer above 91% on the key questions that focus on collaboration and professional growth. 

The following data that shows our need is from our School Quality Guide feedback from staff around collaboration, 
growth and teaming: 

  91% of teachers say that teachers are actively trying to improve their teaching. 
  83% of teachers say that teachers are eager to try new ideas. 
  90% of teachers say that their school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teacher with 

instruction at other grade levels. 

  85% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and 

coherent. 

  72% of teachers say that they had the opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools on 

professional development. 

  60% of our teachers scored an "Effective" over "Highly Effective" in Danielson's 4E for Professional Growth 

and Responsibilities. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will increase the number of classroom teachers that report that they are eager to try to ideas to 88% 
through: work with teachers on their grade level during Monday PD; participation in vertical teams; opportunities to run 
their own professional development for peers; planning with their grade level (1, 2, 3, 4) in a 6th prep weekly; and 
collaboration with teachers from other schools in Learning Partners in order to increase professional collaboration, and 
expand and share best practices as demonstrated by our Quality School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In keeping in mind the goals of Effective School Leadership, we will continue the work that we had started during the 
last three years of implementing Responsive Classroom philosophies and routines. We are expanding the work we are 
doing around social emotional learning to our acceptance as being a pilot school for the E3 initiative. Equity, 
Excellence, and Empathy is an initiative supported by the Wallace Foundation and supports the idea of emotional 
intelligence for all. This work is being done by a planning team from PS 230 over the summer at Yale and the Center 
for Emotional Intelligence.  

We saw a need for this work through the following feedback from staff on the 2017-2018 School Survey: 

  87% of teachers say that adults at their school recognize disruptive behavior as a social-emotional learning 

opportunity. 

  91% of teacher say that adults at their school teach students the skills they need to regulate their behavior 
(by focusing their attention, controlling their emotions, or managing their thinking, behavior, and feelings). 
  81% of teachers say that adults at their school have access to school based supports to assist in behavioral 

and emotional escalations. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will increase the percentage of teachers that report that they teach students how to regulate behavior 
through social-emotional learning opportunities by 5% through professional development from staff members turn-
keying training from Yale University's 'Center for Emotional Intelligence' as seen through the School Quality Guide 
Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a school community, we welcomed, encouraged, and developed partnerships with families, businesses and 
community-based organizations through the hosting of a variety of day and evening events. Through Parent-Teacher 
Conferences, Open School Night, PTA meetings, and other community events, we provided opportunities for families 
to build open communication, respect and trust. Our most recent Quality Review report listed us Well Developed in 
the areas of establishing a culture for learning that is communicated to parents. We are well attended at our cultural 
and school events. During the 2017-2018 school year, our partnership ended with Learning Partners and the wealth of 
volunteers it brought into the community when they went out of business. They had background checked, vetted, and 
trained all of our volunteers. In understanding and adhering to the Chancellor's Regulation on volunteering and 
security of children, we had a Parent Volunteer Committee form through our SLT.  

This committee came up with recommendations to implement for the 2018-2019 school year. We can see the 
immediate need for this from the feedback from our School Quality Guide where parents stated that: 

  75% of families say that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school.  
  90% of families say that they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or 

participating in an activity with their child. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

By June 2019, we will increase the percentage of parents that say that they have had an opportunity to volunteer time 
to support their school by 5% as seen through the parent survey of the School Quality Guide.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

166 
students 
are 
currently 
identified 
as STH 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

We provide our STH population with academic support via our Saturday programs in ELA and Science. We provide 
monthly parent workshops to help parents support their students in ELA and Math. We also provide enrichment 
afterschool during the week in ELA, Math, and Language support. We buy supplies to ensure that we can provide

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All PS 230 staff members meet the highly qualified criteria. 

We have an on-going collaboration with universities supporting their student teachers. These universities include 
Hunter College, Brooklyn College and New York University. We recruit most of our hires from the student teachers 
who train at our school. Since we provide a very strong support system for new recruits, we have a very high 
retention percentage.  

Assignments are based on school needs, state certification and recruits preference. When hiring teachers for an ICT 
position, we also consider the strengths of the individual teachers and the dynamics of the partnership. 

We have a very carefully thought out and executed professional staff development plan for the entire school which is 
differentiated to take into consideration the individual needs of each staff member. Every new teacher receives a 
mentor. Built into our schedule is weekly extended support for new teachers through time with a mentor. In addition, 
we hire education experts in the different content areas to support our work, send teachers to external workshops, 
conferences and network trainings. Each year we have a mentor book which the whole staff reads and reflects on 
throughout the year 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
All staff participate in weekly professional development on Mondays. These sessions are based in the examination, 
reflection, and revision of units of study in reading, writing, and mathematics in order to best align with the CCLS. 
These sessions are facilitated in conjunction with a grade level facilitator that meets in a facilitation team weekly in 
order to support facilitators in helping the meeting address these goals as well as help the administrative cabinet best 
understand the needs of grade levels. Teachers College Reading and Writing Project will be on-site monthly 
conducting professional development with all staff kindergarten through 5 th grade. Teachers College Inclusive 
Classroom Project will be onsite to work with staff in ICT’s and Self-contained classrooms in order to target and plan 
for instruction for diverse learners. Metamorphosis will be coaching our math coach as well as our teacher teams in 
professional development around mathematics. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 

Assistant Principals are involved in monthly professional development through an Assistant Principal group with our 
BFSC. In addition, the administrative team meets with and participates with our staff developers while they are on-
site from TCICP. 

The principal participates in District Principal professional development that occurs monthly. The principal is involved 
in monthly professional development with Learning Partners. All of the administrative professional development is 
rooted in best practices and the alignment of the CCLS in our curriculum.

Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
● We host several parent workshops throughout the year focused on child development stages. We teach parents 
how to support their children in attaining early literacy and math skills with simple activities they can do at home. We 
also have workshops focused on speech and language development that are facilitated by our own speech and 
language teachers.  

● Our speech and language teachers provide speech and language therapy to our pre-K students with IEP’s.  

● Our pre-K teachers have common planning sessions with Kindergarten teachers to ensure that they are preparing 
our students for kindergarten.  

● Fundations, which is a phonics program, is introduced in pre-K. Our pre-K teachers use Fundations as a resource to 
introduce letter and letter sounds to the children.  

● Our pre-k and kindergarten teachers create opportunities for pre-K students to visit kindergarten classrooms 
throughout the year.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

● Pre-K and Kindergarten students participate in an Art Residency Project on a bi-weekly basis. During these times, 
the students get to dance and sing together to develop music appreciation.  

● In June, pre-K teachers complete an assessment form for each student that is given to the next year’s Kindergarten 
teacher. This form details students’ English language development, math skills development and social-emotional 
skills. The form also allows teachers to write any critical information, such as academic or behavior concerns. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Our professional development on Mondays is a time that teachers meet to assess student progress on current units of 
study in mathematics, reading, and writing. During this time, teachers are analyzing their assessments to see if it is 
best addressing the unit and CCLS skills mastered in the units. This time is a forum for teachers to collaborate to plan 
for the various assessments that best suit the need of each unit to help them understand the learning progress of 
their students. The school wide use of Running Records and benchmark assessment and performance assessment in 
Writing and Mathematics is just one measure and one that is used to see a whole school snapshot of progress. 
Teachers are working with their grade level and content level colleagues to create, modify, and align appropriate 
assessments to their units of study. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 
P.S. 230, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support 
of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, 
and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 230 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 230, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments. 

 

I. School Responsibilities: High Quality Curriculum 

Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with Common Core State Standards to enable participating 
children to meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 
1. 

 

2. 

3. 

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 
academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  
1. 

Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 
workshops and conferences.  

Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 
community needs.   
1. 

These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

Program #1: Grades 4 and 5 Computer-Based Research and Technology 
Purpose and Rationale: 
Students will conduct an inquiry-based research project around essential questions for a Social 
Studies unit of study. Through the use of technology, our ENL students will create a power point 
presentation that supports themes, concepts, and vocabulary from the unit. In grade 4, the focus 
will be Native Americans (Iroquois) and grade 5 will focus on European explorers. Students will 
learn how to appropriately use the Internet to conduct their investigations. They will create a list 
of research questions and seek answers to these questions by using online sources. Teachers will 
instruct students on how to navigate different websites for important and useful information. 
Students will become proficient in strategies for investigations.  
Participation in the program will equip our ELL students with the research tools and language 
models necessary to conduct research projects using a variety of sources. By focusing on Social 
Studies topics, students will reinforce their understanding of classroom content. An important 
language goal is for the students to learn the appropriate academic and technical vocabulary 
inherent in content areas, including familiarity with the structures and organization of non-fiction 
information found online. In this way, our program will promote the acceleration of academic 
language and ELL achievement in the content areas. Students will also strengthen their reading 
and writing skills. As part of the ELL focus on theme based learning, students will use multiple 
strategies to improve comprehension skills. They will learn how to organize information by 
importance, pose open ended questions, and interpret information using various note taking 
strategies.  Once their project is complete, students will show their power point presentation to 
others in their group.

their child was chosen to participate in the program. 
Program #2:  Grade 1 - 5  Guided Reading After-School Program 
Purpose and Rationale: 
The purpose of the Guided Reading After-School program is to help our ELL students  become 
independent, strategic readers. When we understand and notice children’s reading behaviors, we 
can support them and give them exactly what they need to move forward.  To ensure that the 
lessons are student-driven, teachers will analyze student data, including running records, 
concepts of print and spelling inventories, informal classroom observations, 
anecdotal records and the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool).  This data is essential for matching 
students' reading ability to text levels and for determining the types of strategies that need to be 
developed, i.e. word attack skills, comprehension strategies, academic language, complex text 
structures, etc. 
Teachers will follow standard guided reading format: introducing a short text, modeling a 
reading strategy, listening to individuals read, prompting students to integrate their reading 
processes and engaging students in conversations about the text, emphasizing academic 
language.  Teachers focus on reading behaviors that the students are demonstrating.  The 
teachers will rotate from student to student while they read quietly or silently.  They will listen 
closely and take anecdotal notes, prompting students occasionally with questions.  During this 
time, teachers can offer instructions based on observations made during reading.

http://ww.readwritethink.org/professional-development/strategy-guides/ 
Target Group: 
The target group is 60 ENL students in grades 1-5 who are below reading level and are having 
difficulty moving to the next reading level as indicated by their running records, reading profiles 
and by the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool). 
Schedule and Duration: 
This program will run Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 pm- 4:15 pm on January 9, 10, 16, 
17, 23, 24, 30, 31, February 6, 7, 13 and February 14, 2019. 
Language of Instruction:  English 
Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 
There will be 10 teachers:  5 licensed ENL teachers and 5 common branch teachers.  We will 
have five classes with one ENL teacher and one common branch teacher per group of 12 
students.  Teachers will provide direct instruction by team teaching and flexible grouping.

Program #3:  Reader's Theater Creative Drama After-School Program 
Purpose and Rationale: 
In the ENL Reader's Theater Creative Drama After-School Program, students will have the 
opportunity to develop fluency and further enhance their reading comprehension.  The purpose 
of this program is to develop fluency through multiple readings of a text by using expressiveness, 
intonation and inflection when rehearsing the text.  Teachers will model and highlight 
strategies for deciphering academic vocabulary and phrasing (collocations) as students engage in 
close reading of content area texts. With the teacher's support, students will read scripts, perform 
in groups and practice using their voice to depict characters from texts.  Texts will focus on 
multiple genres and subjects, including poetry, science, social studies or other content-related 
topics.  The scripts may be leveled to accommodate different readers.  Students will also explore 
different characters' or historical figures' perspectives of historical events.  There will be a 
Readers Theater rubric for students and teachers to evaluate fluency and content knowledge.

Program #4:  Grades K and 1 Reading and Writing Poetry After-School Program 
[“Poetry in Motion”] 
Purpose and Rationale: 
Poetry plays a critical role in literacy development. It offers a wonderful opportunity to support 
our ELLs with their reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.  In addition, poetry helps to 
develop fluency and reading comprehension. The opportunity to discover and learn rhythm and 
rhyme patterns help in the development of oral language skills.  In this program the students

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 230 uses a variety of tools and resources throughout the year to assess the needs of our students, including our ELLs.   
 
Students are assessed in reading using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. Through the use of running 
records and comprehension questions, teachers are able to identify a student's independent and instructional reading level 
and differentiate instruction based on the students' abilities. 
 
In order to develop early literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness, spelling strategies, vocabulary development, word attack 
and comprehension skills, teachers use a systematic phonics program called Fundations in grades K-3 and Wilson in grades 3-5. 
We also use assessments and rubrics from the TCRWP curriculum to assess the early literacy skills of our students, including 
our ELLs.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

To assess writing, P.S. 230 administers  a pre and post on demand writing assessment in grades K-5 throughout the school 
year.  Students also publish writing pieces aligned to the TC writing units. 
 
P.S. 230 uses Investigations in Number, Space and Data (TERC) math curriculum.  Assessments are embedded throughout the 
units.  In addition, fluency quizzes are administered to ensure students are memorizing their math facts. 
 
P.S. 230 also uses the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) for the identification of SIFE students.  We analyze the data and 
use it to guide instructional planning for our ELLs. 
 
Checklists, rubrics, and conference notes are kept to track students’ progress in all academic and content areas. These 
assessments are used to set goals for students' growth in reading, writing, and math. 
 
Using formative data gathered in individual reading, writing and math conferences, students are placed into 
flexible small groups designed to meet comprehension, fluency, writing, or math goals made for each student.  
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support this effort, each classroom has the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System, TC Units of Study in 
Reading and Writing, and the complete TERC Investigations curriculum.  All classroom teachers have a Reading Profile folder in 
which to record the independent reading levels of each student in their class, which shows the student's progress throughout 
the school year.  The running records, as well as the reading profile, is made available to the ENL teachers. Classroom teachers, 
along with ENL Providers, analyze the running records in order to guide instruction. Grade level supervisors also collect and 
analyze the data throughout the year as well. During grade level meetings and Tuesday Extended Time, classroom teachers 
and ENL Providers meet to review student assessments and share conference notes and noticings to develop ongoing 
instruction for the ELL students.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In addition to Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, some grades administer NYC writing performance tasks and/or Math Tasks 
to students in September to identify baseline, progress and areas of need. We evaluate the success of our program by 
analyzing formative and summative data, input from staff, administrators, parents and students, both formally through 
surveys, conferences and informally through school community events.   We look at the data from state exams, such as the 
NYSESLAT, ELA,  and Math to see how our ELLs are performing.  We can then use this information to inform curricular 
decisions.  We understand that our ELL model of instruction must be revisited and evaluated annually to address the needs of 
our dynamic population.  Our curriculum reflects both language and content goals that our ELLs need to meet in order achieve 
academic success. Finally, we strive to maintain a teaching and learning environment where language and cultural diversity is 
not only valued, but also viewed as a strength.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, the information is used to set goals for students' growth in reading,  writing, and 
math. In addition, we use formative data gathered in individual reading, writing, and math conferences.  Students are then 
placed in small, flexible groups designed to meet their individual needs like letter/sound recognition, decoding, 
comprehension, fluency, grammar, spelling, and skills needed during the writing process.  Some small math groups may 
include number recognition, counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division computation skills, as well as solving 
word problems. Many of our Ells are also invited to attend before school, after school, and Saturday Title III 
programs.  Newcomer ELLs work on listening and speaking goals, while the Transitioning and Expanding ELLs work on other 
literacy skills. PS 230 uses both formative and interim assessments to assess early literacy skills of our ELLs which include the 
following: Fountas and Pinnell, Spelling and High Frequency Word inventories including concepts of print, letter identification, 
letter sounds progression, and phonemic awareness. This additional data helps inform our school’s instructional plan to target 
areas of need for individual students as well as design and plan for small group instruction. We also assess our ELLs with the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

comprehensive language arts program, Wilson and Fundations pre- and post- unit assessments. Many of our entering ELLs 
need to develop phonemic awareness in order to gain fluency in reading. This is especially true among our upper grade SIFE 
students who have limited letter/sound knowledge.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The RTI team at P.S. 230 is called the CARE team and is composed of highly qualified school personnel, who meet to discuss RTI 
interventions for at risk students. The team provides tailored strategies that classroom teachers can use to meet the needs of 
these students.  We use data from the following assessments to guide instruction within the RTI framework: New York State 
ELA exam, New York State Math exam, New York State Science exam, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, conference notes, benchmark 
results, current attendance, current grades and classroom portfolios.  The Care Team (RTI Team) analyzes the data to identify 
strengths, challenges and to design specific interventions for each student.  Classroom teachers are given focused instructional 
goals, appropriate strategies are identified, and a check-in time is set to revisit the student’s progress.  Progress monitoring by 
the classroom teacher occurs during this time, and data is later analyzed by the team to track student progress, based on the 
interventions.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We analyze data from the NYSESLAT, as well as the ELA and Math exams, to see how our ELLs are performing on state 
assessments.  We can then use this information to inform curricular decisions. We understand that our ELL model of 
instruction must be revisited and evaluated annually to address the needs of our dynamic population.  Our curriculum reflects 
both language and content goals that our ELLs need to meet in order to achieve academic success. Finally, we strive to 
maintain a teaching and learning environment where language and cultural diversity is not only valued, but also viewed as a 
strength. According to the NYSESLAT and ELA Comparison for 15K230 report from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT),  the 
majority of our ELLs scored either a 1 or a 2 on the 2017 ELA exam. In addition, according to the NYSESLAT and 
Math Comparison for 15K230 report from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT),  the majority of our ELLs also scored either a 1 or 
a 2 on the 2017 Math exam. The Data Anaysis for 15K230 Based on Spring 2017 NYSESLAT revealed that 15% of our ELL 
students scored at the Commanding proficiency level with an additional 5 students scoring a 3 or 4 on the ELA exam and 
Expanding on the NYSESLAT. This report also tracked NYSESLAT progress, indicating that 90 students advanced 1 proficiency 
level, 13 students advanced 2 proficiency levels, 1 student advanced 3 proficiency levels, 123 students remained at the same 
proficiency level, and 16 students regressed 1 proficiency level. According to the Number of NYSESLAT Test Takers and 
Modalities of Strength report, we noticed that students in grades 1 - 4 overall scored highest in the speaking modality. 
However, Kindergarten students scored highest in Reading. The majority of ELLs performed the lowest in the Listening 
modality. According to the At-Risk Level Comparison for 15K230 chart, the largest amount of ELLs (103) fall in the lowest At-
Risk level. Looking at this data, we noticed that as each At-RIsk level increases, the amount of students decreases. The lowest 
amount of ELLs (7) fall in the highest At-Risk level. The cumulation of this data helps inform our ELL programs. Based on this 
data, our Title III programs will include opportunities for the most at risk students to participate in activities that include 
guided reading, shared reading, poetry, reader's theater, and word work. A listening component will be added to some of 
these programs. There will also be a program that strengthens and supports mathematical skills. This data was analyzed by all 
ENL providers and shared with classroom teachers so that they can collaboratively plan and develop lessons that differentiate 
instruction.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Once the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math results have been analyzed, we create tables/graphs that describe our findings.  We 
address students’ progress and areas of need.  The findings are discussed at Faculty meetings. Individual grades meet with 
Administration and our coach to plan for instruction.  Each grade level meets regularly with their ENL providers to plan for 
instruction to meet the needs of all our students.  Our ENL teachers share the data from the NYSESLAT with classroom 
teachers in order to make informed curricula decisions. In addition, the entire school staff is dedicated to analyzing this data 
during a portion of our Monday Professional Development.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our student population is divided between two buildings: the lower school houses Pre K, Kindergarten and first grade, 
and the upper school houses grades two through five. We have an average of six to eight classes per grade with our 
ENL students distributed among all classes to ensure heterogeneous grouping with strong language 
models.  However, some K and 1st grade classrooms are grouped by proficiency to ensure that all students receive the 
mandated minutes of service as per CR Part 154. At the same time, we strategically place native English speakers in 
these grouped classrooms to ensure that strong language models remain for ENL students. This grouping is essential 
in order to maintain the effectiveness of our stand-alone and integrated models, because it allows for ENL teachers to 
work in classrooms more frequently and for teachers to plan collaboratively. In grades 2, 3 and 4, ENL students are 
distributed across 6-7 classrooms, with 3 additional self-contained special education bridge classrooms. Upper grades 
are grouped heterogeneously and receive both integrated and stand alone instruction. In fifth grade, we have fully 
integrated a departmentalized model for general education and ICT classrooms. For the 2017-2018 school year, there 
will be six classrooms, (2 cohorts of 3 classrooms) participating in this model. There will be 2 content specialists for 
each subject area: 2 writing teachers, 2 reading teachers, and 2 math teachers. One cohort includes a full time ENL 
certified teacher and the other cohort includes an ENL provider.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

In September of 2017, we started our first Dual Language Spanish program in Kindergarten.  The goal of our program 
is to create an environment where students will have linguistic and cultural competence in English and Spanish. Our 
dedication to teaching bilingualism and biliteracy will support our school in maintaining excellence. We will be 
employing a simultaneous literacy instruction model, with 50/50 language allocation that divides the language of 
instruction by content area as well as by time. Content areas such as reading, writing, math, and word study are 
taught both in English and Spanish.  One week, English is used 3 times a week and Spanish is used 2 days a week.  The 
following week, Spanish is used 3 times a week and English is used 2 times a week. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

P. S. 230 implements a freestanding English as a New Language Program. The primary goal is to support students’ learning with 
researched-based ENL strategies in order to achieve English Language proficiency within three years and provide students with 
the skills needed to perform at city and state grade levels in all subject areas. In September of 2017, we started our first Dual 
Language Spanish program in Kindergarten.  The goal of our program is to create an environment where students will have 
linguistic and cultural competence in English and Spanish.  We will be employing a simutaneous literacy instruction model, 
with 50/50 language allocation that divides the language of instruction by content area as well as by time.  In our freestanding 
ENL component we service students from grades K-5. They range from Entering to Commanding proficiency levels. Students 
are mostly distributed uniformly across the grades and receive all instruction in English with native language support. 
NYSESLAT scores and NYSITELL results determine how many units of ENL instruction each student receives. Depending on their 
proficiency level, ENL students receive between 180 minutes to 360 minutes a week of ENL instruction. Entering students 
receive 360 minutes of ENL services per week: 180 minutes of stand-alone and 180 minutes of integrated instruction. 
Emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL services per week: 90 minutes of stand-alone and 270 minutes of integrated

instruction. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction per week. Oftentimes, ENL 
teachers work with small groups of transitioning students within the classroom.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL services per week. Our stand-alone model provides focused, individualized, small group instruction both inside 
and outside of the classroom. Our integrated model provides language and content grade-level support within the classroom 
setting, using a collaborative teaching model.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The goal of our ENL program is to foster full English proficiency in a supportive classroom environment. This year, we are 
progressing with our school-wide initiative to incorporate Common Core aligned language objectives in all our units of study. 
Furthermore, to support language and content learning (Social Studies, Math and Science), we use the following practices:  
  
ENL and classroom teachers support content areas in the following ways:  
  
Social Studies and Science 
Our school has purchased the NYCDOE Passport to Social Studies Units of Study for all grades and many of the supplementary 
materials that accompany them. These units include supports for all learners and will serve as our primary curriculum for 
Social Studies. Teachers identify linguistically challenging material and scaffold instruction with visual aids such as maps, 
atlases, graphic organizers, learner dictionaries, glossaries, pictures, and online digital media tools to increase comprehension. 
They also collaborate to organize trips that support thematic units of study. All teachers (classroom, content and ENL) attend. 
  
Mathematics 
Teachers use manipulatives and a variety of models, such as open number lines, arrays, strings, etc. to represent difficult word 
problems visually, tackle challenging math vocabulary using concept circles, semantic maps, glossaries and word sorts to 
preview vocabulary. For the past few years we have been implementing the TERC Investigations Curriculum, which provides 
the students with opportunities to learn mathematics through inquiry. Our 5th grade teachers are currently participating in 
New York City's Algebra for All initiative which provides extensive professional Development opportunities for teachers. 
Through the Algebra for All training, students will leave PS 230 with a solid foundation in mathematical reasoning and pre-
algebraic thinking that will enable them to be successful math students in middle school and high school. 
 
All of our English Language Learners are invited to "mathematize" initially in their own informal ways, giving ELLs opportunities 
to develop expressive language proficiency when talking about mathematical concepts. Teachers are taught to look for 
important mathematical moments and scaffold conversations to develop oral proficiency that lead to solutions. Teachers 
participate in learning communities to look deeply at "big ideas" in mathematics and identify the language demands of 
investigations.  In addition, we have created language objectives for math units of study that highlight linguistically dense 
structures common in mathematic word problems. Teachers also have students create personalized math vocabulary and 
bilingual dictionaries. 
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We now use the MLS (Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener) for the Identification of Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent 
Formal Education in the students' native languages. Reports are generated and shared with classroom teachers in order to 
utilize the native language as a resource. We also use the Spanish LAB. In the fall, we will start using the BOY/MOY/EOY in our 
Spanish Dual Language program. We also use bilingual teachers and/or school personnel to conduct informal evaluations of 
students during the intake procedure. During the intake process, we acquire student writing samples and recruit school 
personnel who speak the native language to guide teachers in assessing native language literacy. This process, along with the 
assessments and parent/student interviews, gives us an overview of the students’ ability, so that classroom teacher can build 
on common underlying proficiencies. Also, ELL students who are literate in their native language have the option to take 
standardized content exams in their native language. We train them to use bilingual glossaries so that they are comfortable 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

using them as a resource both in the classroom and during the exam. 
    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) Plan for SIFE 
Our SIFE population is relatively small. However, we have a clear course of instruction and supports in place. ELL students with 
interrupted, little or no formal schooling in their first language will receive integrated and stand alone ENL services as well as 
small group instruction in specific areas of need. We provide the following interventions to SIFE students: 
b) Plan for Newcomers 
When a new student is registered in our school, we provide several supports to facilitate their transition. Once the school year 
begins, newcomers are immersed in a language-rich environment with several supports. In grades K and 1 they primarily 
remain in the classroom since the proficiency levels are more homogeneous. In grades 2 through 5, newcomers attend a 
modified stand-alone ENL program.  
  
Upon their arrival at our school, we conduct an informal student interview/orientation and sometimes pair the newcomer with 
a student of similar language/cultural background for a given period of time. Newcomer ENL students also participate in a new 
student orientation that includes a tour of the premises, explanation of school policies, expectations and events, and 
introductions to key staff and other members of the school community. Throughout the year, we regularly maintain ongoing 
home-school communication. When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following instructional resources 
to facilitate their transition:  
c) Plan for Developing ELLs 
The plan for developing ELLs mirrors the plan for Newcomers with the exception of the new student orientation activities and 
the Newcomer Kit. In addition, developing ELLs receive targeted small-group instruction through Leveled Literacy Guided 
Reading and Shared Writing instruction that emphasizes strategies for tackling the language demands of classroom content. 
  
d) Plan for ELLs receiving services for 4-6 
ELLs receiving services for 4-6 years represent the largest number of ELLs across grades 2 to 5. An analysis of our ELL data has 
revealed these ELLs struggle with academic vocabulary, a deficit that has been shown to impact comprehension of higher-level 
texts. Drawing on these findings, we have identified a need for these ELLs to expand their academic vocabulary in order to 
develop automaticity as readers and writers. Classroom and ENL teachers collaborate to design lessons and curricular 
modifications that include explicit vocabulary and spelling instruction. Our continuing goal is to support ELLs in developing 
word consciousness through language and literacy instruction while simultaneously expanding their knowledge of all content 
areas.   
  
Our action plan for this group involves:  
  
Plan for Long Term ELLs (6+ years) 
Long Term ELLs represent a small number of ELLs at P.S. 230. Our action plan for this is the same as the plan for our 4-6 ELLs, 
with the following additions: 
  
e) Plan for Former ELLs   
Students who are former ELLs receive additional support in the classroom from ENL teachers. They will receive 90 minutes a 
week of integrated ENL instruction as per CR Part 154.2. At the beginning of the year the ENL staff compile and analyze 
assessment data on former ELLs to determine specific areas of need. Teachers continue to provide support in the classroom 
for former ELLs by including them with ELLs during small group instruction. Former ELLs receive testing accommodations on all 
standardized assessments. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

All ELLs and former ELLs are eligible for testing accomodations for up to two years after testing out, in addition to any 
accommodations on their IEPs or 504 plans.  Testing accommodations for ELL students on the NYS ELA and content area 
assessments include the following: 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our school ensures that all ELL-SWDs receive appropriate ENL instruction and their mandated services. ENL teachers review 
student's IEPs and meet with special education teachers to design instruction that support students' individual IEP goals. 
Classrooms with ELL-SWDs contain a variety of materials that support instruction. These include, math manipulatives, 
magnetic letters and letter tiles, audio books, music and educational games. Technology is also utilized, for example, laptop 
accessibility, web-based programs (X-tra Math.org,  Imagine Learning, First in Math, Read&Write for Google), interactive 
programs available on Smartboard technology, and the use of document readers/projectors. We assess students' progress 
with Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments and intervention kits. In addition we provide teachers and students in our dual 
language program with TERC curricula, materials, and resources in Spanish. 
 
Our ENL teachers use many instructional strategies and grade level materials that provide access to academic content areas 
and accelerate English language development.  We strongly adhere to the UDL philosophy. Teachers differentiate content, 
process and product: we differentiate content by modifying texts, supplemental curricula, using multimedia resources, 
collections of themed books, fiction and non-fiction picture books, graphic organizers, charts with visuals and models of writing 
tasks, bilingual materials and varied pacing for different learners.  The learning process is differentiated through step by step 
displayed directions, rubrics and checklists, visuals and models of note-taking that appeal to all learning styles, drawing to 
express ideas, flexible grouping, audio books for newcomers and through social language models.  Finally, we differentiate 
learning products and output by offering students different formats in which to demonstrate their understanding.  These 
include written tasks (standard reports, essays, stories, maps, diagrams etc.), verbal tasks (oral presentations, interviews, etc.), 
performance based tasks (role play) and creative tasks (painting, drawing, graphs, models, dioramas, etc.).  
  
ELL students with disabilities receive intensive support by our ENL instructors in their classrooms to facilitate their reading, 
writing and language skills in order to meet their IEP goals. The classroom teacher uses specialized reading programs, such as 
Fundations for grades K, 1, 2, and 3, Wilson for grades 4 and 5, and Imagine Learning for grades K - 5. Classroom teachers 
collaborate with ENL teachers, SETSS and Speech providers to differentiate instruction to meet the individual needs of Special 
Education ELLs. Students with IEPs participate in daily small group instruction modified to meet individual student needs. 
Cluster teachers, as well as ENL specialists, have been trained to read IEPs so they are familiar with students’ goals and make 
instructional accommodations according to the students’ learning needs. 
  
Our policy for special needs students also includes: 
    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We ensure scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse need of our ELL SWDs by using both the stand-alone and integrated 
models of instruction. Through the stand-alone model, we provide focused, individualized instruction both inside and out of 
the classroom. Through the integrated model, general and special education teachers collaborate with ENL teachers to create 
lessons, materials and activities that follow UDL principles, providing multiple points of entry and expression. 
 
Furthermore, teachers plan assessments that allow for various means of representation, including the use of technology.  In 
both the upper and lower grades, some individual special education students are mainstreamed for specific content areas. The 
special education teacher and the general education teacher, along with the ENL teacher, create lessons and activities to meet 
the needs of these students.  Their lessons also provide multiple points of entry and expression. Teachers show flexibility in the 
variety of co-teaching models they employ to integrate content and language. We use multiple criteria to place ELL-SWDs in 
ICT classes, for example formative and summative assessments, classroom observations, etc. The decision is based on the 
recommendation of teachers, administration, the school-based support team and most of all, the students' IEP.           

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our RTI team determines if a student is responding to classroom instruction and progressing as expected, and provides 
instructional support through the RTI multi-tiered model. We monitor each tier, providing instruction that increases intensity 
over time. The RTI team at P.S. 230 is called the CARE team and is composed of highly qualified school personnel, who meet to 
discuss RTI interventions for at risk students. The team provides tailored strategies that classroom teachers can use to meet 
the needs of these students.  Classroom teachers are given focused instructional goals, appropriate strategies are identified, 
and a check-in time is set to revisit the student’s progress.  Progress monitoring by the classroom teacher occurs during this 
time, and data is later analyzed by the team to track student progress, based on the interventions. 
 
We have a wide variety of targeted intervention programs for our ELLs in ELA, Math and the other content areas. All our 
intervention programs are offered in English and target literacy and content area reading and writing. Some native language 
support is used depending upon availability of school personnel. However, students are able to use resources in their native 
language.  Examples include, bilingual books, content area glossaries, learner dictionaries and visual dictionaries.   
 
Interventions include online learning programs, voice-to-text applications, guided and shared reading group instruction, small-
group foundational reading, math and writing groups.  In the lower and upper grades, we use Fundations and Wilson 
comprehensive language arts programs. We enhance our existing curriculum with other curricular resources with intervention 
and investigative learning resources such as Algebra for All, Fountas and PInnell  Leveled Literacy Intervention, Reader's 
Theater, Imagine Learning, Purposeful Pairs (fiction/non-fiction texts). 
 
Throughout the day, teachers also meet with small groups of ELLs to develop specialized math reading strategies. In science 
and social studies, teachers identify linguistically challenging material and scaffold instruction with visual aids, such as maps, 
interactive altlases, graphic organizers, learner dictionaries, glossaries and picture cards to increase comprehension. They also 
collaborate with the ENL teachers to organize trips that support thematic units of study. Some ELL students receive speech 
intervention services.  In addition we provide intervention services to our ELLs through our SETSS teacher (Lisa Bradley).  Our 
SETSS teacher uses a range of materials to meet the needs of students, such as modified texts, learner dictionaries, text sets, 
modified assessments, multimedia resources, graphic organizers and visual aids. These interventions are also used with our 
newcomers, our SIFE students and our long term ELLS, as well as students who have 4-6 years of service.  The only additional 
modification is the native language support for our newcomers. In our self-contained special education classes and in our ICT 
classes, some of the students receive intervention in either Spanish, Chinese or Bengali through their bilingual 
Paraprofessionals.  
           
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 This year, we have a school wide focus on increasing academic conversations through out the school day. We are 
using Academic Conversations by Jeff Zwiers & Marie Crawford as our mentor text. This text identifies core communication 
skills needed for students to hold productive, academic conversations across content areas. The staff is studying ways to 
improve critical thinking skills, literacy skills, and academic vocabulary and grammar. In addition, after analyzing the EDAT data 
and trends, we incorporated First In Math for Grades 4 and 5. This program helps students acquire, reinforce and retain 
essential math skills. It develops their critical thinking, problem solving, and communication abilities.  Also,  we created a new 
Title III program that focuses on poetry incorporating Climb Into a Poem. Poetry is one of our school wide initiatives this year 
because it builds community, fluency and vocabulary, and opens venues for speaking and listening. Poetry can be accessible 
for ELLs because they can find ways to express themselves. Finally, we will maintain some of the current programs for the 
coming year. We will continue to provide a variety of programs that support our ELL students and families during in-school and 
after-school programs.

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All of our ELLs are encouraged to participate in Title III programs as well as other academic and enrichment programs. 
Programs are funded through Title I SWP, Title I Translation SWP, TL Fair Student Funding, PTA fund, Common Core and the 
Arts federal grant, P.S. 230 School Fund, and TL Translation Services. We also use Title III funds. ENL teachers recruit regularly 
and try to match students to programs that are designed to develop areas of proficiency that are specific to individual needs. 
We generate EDAT data to analyze trends in students' NYSESLAT scores, IEP goals, ELA and Math scores and years of service, 
which guides us in matching students to certain programs.  
  
Parents are notified about programs through informational flyers in their native language. Also, teachers are consulted as to 
which children might benefit more from a particular program. For our Title III programs, ELLs are represented 100%. For non-
Title III programs, ELL representation is approximately 30%. These numbers fluctuate annually. Our participation rate has 
always been high and attendance in these programs is nearly always 100%. Academic programs operate Monday through 
Friday during the school day and Saturdays. They include the following: Music and Movement for grades K and 1, 
BCT (Brooklyn Children's Theater) for grades 2 and 3, and Arts Connection residency for grades 4 and 5. Additionally, grade 4 
receives Mark Morris Dance Company. Saturday programs include Cooking, New York Cares, Robotics, Tennis, Saturday Science 
and Art. After-school programs include the Garden Club, BCT (Brooklyn Children's Theater) program, South Asian Youth Action 
(SAYA), Singing Winds and the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music Program. Our Title III funding is used to fund additional 
enrichment programs (See Title III narrative draft for more detail).   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The ENL program incorporates the Balanced Literacy Program based on the Teacher’s College Model. Students engage in 
activities designed to strengthen and support their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in order to achieve proficiency 
in English. 
 
Since our ENL program uses both the integrated and stand-alone models of instruction, instructional materials for literacy and 
content are available for all program models and the expectation is that they are used in all instructional settings. However, we 
may also include specialized materials and modifications to make content comprehensible. These include Smartboard 
interactive technology, content-specific graphic organizer templates, bilingual dictionaries, texts and audio libraries, digital 
libraries and online learning programs (MYON, Imagine Learning, pebblego.com, brainpop.com)  and TC video archives. 
Students also have access to tablets, Chrome books and laptop computers on each floor in the Upper School. In the Lower 
School, students have access to computers in our new, state of the art computer lab. Native language and multicultural 
libraries represent the diverse cultures of our school. All classrooms feature a print-rich and picture-rich environment. 
Classroom libraries are equipped with leveled fiction and non-fiction picture books that reflect the current units of study and 
the cultural diversity of the school. In addition we have visual and native language dictionaries and bilingual math, science and 
social studies glossaries. Our goal is to support instruction and in an engaging and low-anxiety learning environment by making 
appropriate classroom materials accessible and modifying them when needed.   
   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ENL teachers work with classroom teachers to scaffold the teaching of writing and reading by modifying materials to meet the 
linguistic and cultural demands of academic text, thereby making content more accessible to ELLs. In our Dual Language class, 
content areas such as reading, writing, math, and word study are taught both in English and Spanish.  One week, English is 
used 3 times a week and Spanish is used 2 days a week. The following week, Spanish is used 3 times a week and English is used 
2 times a week. Emergent literacy is taught in both languages depending on the schedule for the week. Both program 
models provide home language support through the use of bilingual books, bilingual dictionaries and word to word content 
area glossaries when appropriate.   For certain activities, students are grouped according to native language so they can help 
each other and converse in their home language.  At times, school personnel provides support to students, especially to those 
who are having difficulty with content-related material.  Students are given native language support in math, science and social 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

studies to develop content and language goals in preparation for state exams.  During the content area exams, students may 
simultaneously use English and alternative language editions.  For low incidence languages, oral translations may be given 
when students are taking content area exams.  Native language support and grade/age appropriate content is also provided 
through bilingual checklists, rubrics and glossaries. (See plans for subgroups). Finally, our ENL/Bilingual teachers participate in 
ongoing professional development.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our curriculum is modified to meet the needs of all ages and proficiencies across grade levels. We ensure that students of all 
proficiencies have access to materials and curricular supports that are developmentally appropriate. Resources are adapted by 
using modified texts, graphic organizers, visual aids and personal vocabulary glossaries with picture support based on the 
needs of the students.  For example, we have a newcomer library with high interest/ low readability texts for beginner ELLs 
and ELLs in ICT classrooms. In this way, students have access to Common Core aligned materials and lessons can be modified 
with grade-appropriate materials.  Services are also adapted by using interventions, such as online learning programs (see #13) 
, voice-to-text applications, guided and shared reading group instruction, small-group foundational reading, math and writing 
groups based on the students cognitive needs.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building with another school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We, along with our Parent Coordinator,  assist newly enrolled ELLs before the school year by maintaining relationships with 
our Community Based Organization partnerships in Kensington, such as the public library and regular outreach to several 
cultural institutions (local Mosques, Bengali Community Centers, etc.) that advocate for our students and their 
families.  Activities at the beginning of the school year include new student orientations, building tours, buddy assignments 
(with the same native language), introductions to key staff and other members of the school community and end-of-day 
debriefing with the ENL teacher. Throughout the year, we regularly maintain ongoing home-school communication. When a 
new student is registered in our school, we provide the following instructional resources to facilitate their transition:  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

P.S. 230 has over 20 different languages represented, of which many are low incident languages.  Most instruction in content 
areas is in English, except for our Kindergarten Dual Language class.  However, students occasionally opt for native language 
testing in the content areas, which is provided.  Students are supported by ENL teachers and the use of native language 
resources to gain access to concepts taught. Many of our students are not literate in their native languages.  The few that are 
literate in their native language have only been exposed to concept vocabulary in English and opt not to take the test in their 
native language.  As a result, language electives are not applicable to P.S. 230. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

P.S. 230's Dual Language Program uses a self-contained model.  The same teacher provides full-day 
instruction in English and Spanish, alternating days.  Content areas such as reading, writing, math, and 
word study are taught both in English and Spanish.  One week, English is used 3 times a week and Spanish 
is used 2 days a week.  The following week, Spanish is used 3 times a week and English is used 2 times a 
week.  Emergent literacy is taught in both languages depending on schedule for the week.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All K-5 classroom teachers and ENL teachers receive staff development from the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project 
in order to develop and support the teaching of literacy  There are two staff developers assigned to P.S. 230.  One staff 
developer works with grades K-2 and the other works with grades 3-5. They are on site for a total of 10 days across the school 
year. Teachers are selected to work with the staff developers based on both the teacher and student needs. Teachers are also 
given the opportunity to select TC calendar days based on a topic of their interest or need. 
 
Additionally, teachers are provided professional development by administration, content coaches, and colleagues during 
Monday afternoon PD time. Other professional development is provided by school staff, support personnel, our Borough Field 
Support Center (BFSC). Participants include common branch teachers, ENL teachers and Coordinators, special education 
teachers, paraprofessionals, the guidance counselor, school psychologists, social workers, occupational and physical therapists, 
speech therapists, school secretaries, the parent coordinator, assistant principals and the principal. In the past years, we have 
made a significant investment in professional development around the ELA, Math and Social Studies and Science Common 
Core Standards and the implications for ELLs.  
 
The year-long PD calendar for Monday afternoons includes three cycles (4-5 sessions each) of analyzing data for the ELA and 
Math tests, making instruction plans, and monitoring progress.  Additionally every six weeks, PD will be presented based on 
the mentor text, Academic Conversations by Jeff Zwiers and Marie Crawford. 
 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  Continuous learning is part of the P.S. 230 culture. All P.S. 230 staff will participate in ongoing Monday afternoon professional 
development. Professional development sessions run for 35 Mondays covering a range of topics. However, 15% of the topics 
are ELL related themes, such as UDL and developing language goals for units of study. ENL teachers will participate in all ELL 
related Monday PD, plus 35% of additional ELL related professional development sponsored by outside agencies and 
institutions. All professional development sessions are documented. We keep copies of agendas, attendance rosters and 
materials in a PD binder.     
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 230 provides multiple opportunities for ENL teachers to meet individually with the parents or guardians of English 
language learners. In addition to parent-teacher conferences and initial parent orientations, ENL teachers meet with 
parents/guardians of ELLs separately, at least once per year.  At this meeting, teachers discuss students’ progress and 
individual goals of their child’s language development. Parents are informed of their child’s English language proficiency 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

 

assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Translation is made available as needed. 
 
All meeting topics and signatures of attendants are documented and stored in a parent engagement binder. Parents are 
informed about meetings through letters, flyers and/or phone calls in the home language. If they are not able to attend, we try 
to accommodate them by alternate means including phone conferences and emails. 
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At PS 230, we understand that parent involvement is critical to student success. ELL parents are encouraged to be actively 
involved in the life of our school. During the school year, parents are invited to attend curricular meetings and workshops 
developed by our ENL team on instructional issues, assessments, and strategies to support children’s academic progress. The 
parent workshops being offered during the 2017 - 2018 school year are as follows:   
 
 Translators are available at all meetings to assist parents and answer any questions. Translation devices are provided for 
Spanish, Bengali, and Chinese families. Many of our ELL parents participate in Saturday Family Science, which involves 
interactive, content-based STEM activities for families at every grade level.  We also provide several cultural events that 
welcome families to collaborate and be involved in PTA and school events. 
  
PS 230 has developed partnerships with agencies and community-based organizations, which provide workshops or services to 
ELL parents such as NYU’s Langone Center for Early Childhood Health and Development, CITE (Center for Integrated Teachers’ 
Education) and The Singing Wings.  We also maintain partnerships with several public and private agencies that encourage 
interactive family literacy opportunities. These include the Brooklyn Public Library, Arts Connection, Brooklyn Children’s 
Theater, and the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music.  During these events and workshops, we rely on our school staff and 
community (i.e. school aides, paraprofessionals, parents) as well as bilingual staff from the partnering organizations to provide 
translation services.   
 
Ongoing, effective communication with parents is our number one priority.  We will continue to encourage parents to use our 
school website regularly, which can be translated into over 60 languages. Postings on the website include suggestions on ways 
to support children’s learning at home as well as how to access community resources, trips, educational media, etc. Parents 
are kept informed about important dates and school documents through the school website, email blasts, and backpack 
mail.  Parents are also free to stop in to visit the parent coordinator to voice concerns. Our parent coordinator is able to 
organize events, collaborate with community partners, create and distribute promotional materials, monitor parent 
involvement, and assess the needs of the families.  There are several other forums for parents to share their concerns, for 
example any of our school wide events (PTA meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences, book fairs, school fairs, Gallery Night, 
movie night, Kensington community meetings, etc.), which are opportunities for the parent coordinator, administration and 
staff to be visible and accessible to parents. Translators are provided as needed. Feedback from our informal surveys are used 
to plan for parent involvement activities and strive to revise them as the population evolves.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maria Della Ragione, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During registration, parents complete the Department of Education’s Home Language Survey as well as a school-
generated form in which parents indicate their preferred language for written materials. Additionally, teachers 
are able to reference the blue emergency card and inform the school aides of the number of notices they need in 
the various languages. We are also able to respond to verbal requests when parents arrive at the school for 
parent meetings, conferences and special events.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

also hold parent meetings every 
Tuesday, as needed per teacher and 
student need. Our School Based 
Support Team is in constant contact 
with families as well as our 
Attendance Teacher. Our Parent 
Coordinator is in daily contact with 
families and holds parent meeting 
daily. We have monthly meetings 
hosted by LINC's for parents around 
parent topics. Parent Teacher 
Association meetings are monthly 
and always include a seminar around 
content learning to support their 
student.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At the beginning of the school year, the parent coordinator provides all teachers with the DOE brochure that outlines 
the support provided by the translation and interpretation services. Teachers then provide this brochure to parents. 
Parent Coordinator also verbally presents these available services at all PTA meetings and Pre-K and Kindergarten 
Orientations.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The parent coordinator organizes forums for parents to come together, ask questions and voice concerns. In October, 
an event was planned for parents of Spanish-speaking families and was led by the school’s bi-lingual psychologist and 
social worker. This event was advertised by a Spanish flyer and email and was also posted on the school calendar. 
Additional forums for other languages are being planned for the year.
