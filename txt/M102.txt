Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission at P.S. 102 is for students to explore through learning. We believe that children explore learning through 
individualized learning plans where, teachers, families, and children collaborate using interdisciplinary approaches 
with a focus on giving specific, actionable feedback and through recognizing positive behaviors to develop socially 
responsible and productive human beings.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 102 Jacques Cartier School is an elementary school housing grades pre-kindergarten through 5th grade, located in 
East Harlem. We are a culturally diverse Title I school offering General Education, Special Education, and Gifted and 
Talented settings for our students.  

Some of our partnerships include Rosie’s Theater Kids (a theater program that works with 5 th graders on a musical 
production, and exposes the students to Broadway musical theater); Union Settlement (through which we get Inter-
generational Tutors for struggling readers; and Photos and Me – a investigative after school program that supports 
English Language Learners with language acquisition and foundational literacy skills), Mutti-gree and Pet Therapy (an 
academic intervention that builds reading confidence); and Education in Dance (a collaboration that supports our 
Special Education students with academic, physical and social growth).  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Self-Contained Special Education: Students generally received 1's in ELA and Math State Tests. We are working to 
ensure that students are working with grade level content, and that curriculum and instruction meets individual 
students where they are. 

Gifted and Talented: Students are working above grade level. We are working to ensure students are being challenged 
appropriately. 

General Education Students: We are working to ensure students are meeting proficiency.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The area in which we have made the most progress in the Framework for Great Schools is in building Strong Family-
Community Ties. Our key areas of focus in the Framework for Great Schools are Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative 
Teachers, Supportive Environment and Effective School Leadership.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The school's strengths relative to Rigorous Instruction include reading and mathematics. This is based on teacher 
reported grades and Fountas & Pinnell Reading Assessments. Specifically, 25% of students in Grades K-5 in June 2018 
were on grade level in reading as measured by Fountas & Pinnell Assessments. Additionally, 33% of students in 
Grades K-5 in June 2018 were above grade level in reading as measured by Fountas & Pinnell Assessments. In 
mathematics, 42% of students in Grades K-5 in June 2018 were on grade level according to report card grades. Also, 
22% of students in Grades K-5 in June 2018 were above grade level according to report card grades.  

The priority needs that will be addressed for Rigorous Instruction are in writing. This is based on Teachers College 
Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) assessments, PPO feedback, and the 2018 NYS ELA Test.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 60% of students in Grades K - 5 will be proficient in writing as measured by achieving a Level 3 or 4 on 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) Rubrics when used to assess on demand writing tasks.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

A strength relative to this framework is that the school has systematic structures in place for teachers to meet weekly 
with their teams. In addition, the school has created a vertical instructional cabinet that has scheduled dedicated 
weekly meeting times for the school year. 

A priority for our school based on the advanced data and data from the PPO is that we need to build teacher capacity 
around assessment and curriculum adjustment.  

  4% teachers rated Highly Effective, 56% Effective, 40% Developing on Component 3c (Advance, 2018) 
  4% teachers rated Highly Effective, 76% Effective, 20% Developing on Component 1e (Advance, 2018) 
  2018 PPO feedback included working with teacher teams to further enhance their capacity to analyze 

assessment data and student work for students they share or on whom they are focused so that it results in 
improved teacher practice and progress toward goals for groups of students (4.2) 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders and teacher leaders will create and implement professional development activities that 
will build teacher capacity to assess data, revise and adjust curriculum and instruction as measured by 85 % of the 
teachers receiving effective or highly effective on advance observation ratings.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
PS 102 recruits teachers through outreach to teaching colleges, including New York University, Columbia's Teachers 
College, Bank Street College of Education and CUNY/Hunter and CUNY City College. Staff members are encouraged to 
make recommendations of colleagues for professional opportunities in our building. Additionally, we provide multiple 
opportunities for teachers to receive professional development through the Department of Education and our own 
professional development plan based on teacher need. Teachers who are new to our building will receive mentoring 
services from one of our highly qualified teachers for one year. Staff assignments are based on area of expertise, skill 
set, and New York State Certification.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
In addition to having curriculum based professional development (Teacher's College Writing Project, Junior Great 
Books, and NTN), we also have cycles of professional developments based on need. During the first cycle the 
professional development committee facilitates professional learning around our instructional focus for the year: 
Student Engagement. The second cycle will focus on an area of need identified by the teacher as per the Danielson 
Rubric. Finally, our third round of professional development will focus on a problem of practice for the teacher in an 
inquiry group. Paraprofessionals take part in these professional development opportunities with the teacher they 
work with. This year we will be supporting paraprofessionals further through bimonthly paraprofessional meetings 
based on areas of need and enriching instruction in the classroom.

We conduct joint Pre kindergarten and Kindergarten professional development in order to facilitate a smoother 
transition between the grades. Additionally, our Pre kindergarten students visit kindergarten classrooms toward the 
end of the school year so that they can know what to expect when going to the next grade. Finally, our kindergarten 
teachers host meetings for pre kindergarten families in the spring to support the transition to the next grade. Pre 
kindergarten engages in the ESI-R to diagnose students who might have developmental delays. Additionally, teachers 
use TS Gold to identify students' academic and social needs within the classroom. This information is archived and 
given to the kindergarten teacher.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Committees of teachers were formed to analyze our student data and make instructional decisions for our 
community. During this process, the committee decided to choose formative assessments to monitor student 
learning, such as Fountas and Pinnell Levels, and On-Demand Writing Pieces as measured by the Teachers College 
Grade Level Rubrics. Additionally, a MoSL committee will be formed in September to choose Measures of Student 
Learning for Year. These assessments will be used as a baseline and summative assessment for student growth. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 102, Jacques Cartier School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 102, Jacques Cartier School, will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology through the implementation of monthly workshops; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children through parent meetings, and School Leadership Team; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress through schoolwide celebrations, Harambee, and PBIS Assesmblies; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The following assessments are used to guide instructional planning for ELLs: the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark System 
Running Records, iReady assessments, and TCRWP writing assessments; in addition, formative assessments of listening and 
speaking are performed throughout the year, through evalution of oral presentations, attentiveness and responsiveness to 
mini-lessons.  This data reveals student ability in the following areas: phonemic awareness, phonics, reading, oral expression, 
listening, speaking and writing.  The data provides information on student reading levels, reading behaviors, reading exposure, 
and strengths and weaknesses.  The information is used to create a portfolio of the student's learning and growth over time, as 
well as to create small group instruction and support and inform instruction to individualize learning.      

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

  
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All teachers are required to gather data on student performance (oral responses to written and spoken questions and 
prompts, reading fluency, retelling capability, written responses to questions and prompts, and the other curriculum-
embedded assessments enumerated upon above); teachers who have ELLs in their classrooms are required to collect this data 
on classroom performance when the ENL teacher is not in the room to do so himself; this data is shared by all teachers 
through online spreadsheets, enabling everyone to access it. Meetings are held between the ENL teacher and the classroom 
teachers in question to provide the latter group with supports and scaffolds that might aid the ELLs in accessing the core 
content curriculum when the ENL teacher is not there. The ENL teacher and the classroom teachers share lesson plans, 
teaching points, and ideas using Google Docs as well, to maximize collaborative time and ensure that observations about 
performance are disseminated throughout the school.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
PS 102 evaluates the success of its programs for ELLs by analyzing both the NYSESLAT results.  We also discuss whether we 
have met our Annual Yearly Progress, looking at ELA and Math results for grades 3-5.  We also use student portfolios, teacher 
formal and informal assessments, and perform an item analysis of all the questions on the exam to determine growth from the 
prior year and the beginning of the year from classroom assessments of students in grades 3-5.  The SETSS, ICT, general 
education, and ENL teachers meet to discuss these findings and to determine if particular students need additional support 
and create an academic intervention plan to meet those goals; the former two are engaged solely to discuss ELL-SWDs.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered, it is coupled with the EDAT reports and disseminated to teachers, intervention 
planning can be commenced. During related grade-team meetings, performance of ELLs is highlighted and possible 
interventions are discussed. Following consultation with colleagues and administration, teachers undertake a variety of efforts, 
as per the data, to shift or maintain instructional practices for the benefit of their ELLs.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
 ELL students who are identified in grades K-2 as needing academic support are serviced by the  ICT, SETSS (the former two 
only if they are ELL-SWDs), and ENL teachers within small groups with their homeroom teacher. Students get a double-dose of 
Fundations (decoding/encoding words) 5X a week.  The needs of each student are analyzed to then assist with the grouping of 
students for reading and math. The materials used for RTI are reading intervention programs with a focus on fluency.   ELL 
strategies are woven into the lessons by providing students with frontloading, comprehensible input, building prior 
knowledge, providing realia, defining language and content objectives, as well as offer students multiple opportunities to use 
the new vocabulary. During these sessions, teachers will focus on the four modalities of language learning. All students  are 
given a baseline test at the beginning of the year to provide data on student progress and identify possible students in need of 
Tier 1,2, or 3.  For Tier I intervention all students receive high-quality instruction that is aligned with the core 
curriculum.   Differentiation is considered for all students and intervention is then individualized based on student needs to 
design a preventative approach to not meeting the standards and a proactive approach towards meetings academic goals.  All 
children are taught within the classroom in the least restrictive environment. All students are assessed periodically to identify 
and keep track of student needs, as well as modify instruction and determine how support can continue to be scaffolded.  Data 
is used to not only drive instruction but to determine specific strengths and weaknesses of each child.  Classroom lessons are 
taught as whole group, small group 3-5 students, paired groups, and individually.  Teachers model and guide instruction, as 
well as differentiate and confer with all students. Strategy groups are also created to ensure all learners are able to learn. For 
Tier 2 intervention,  teachers create smaller (3-5 students), more strategic groups that meet with more frequency and 
intensity, as well as focus in on specific goals and strategies to ensure support for learning.  These groups receive more small 
group frontloading sessions  before whole group lessons to provide comprehensible input and improve CALPS within the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

classroom.  City Year, ICT or SETSS teacher provides services in small groups outside of the classroom based on student needs. 
Students meet for 6-8 weeks to provide intense support and meet short term goals discussed by the teacher and the 
provider.  Student are also invited to PS 102's afterschool programs with Union Settlement (Photos and Me) and  Kids Creative. 
Students are assessed at the beginning , middle, and end of this cycle. For Tier 3 intervention, based on assessment data and 
teacher recommendations, students are supported individually and instruction is even more intense. Students meet with the 
SETSS teacher who provides at-risk intervention,  (trained in RTI models of teaching) five times a week for 30 to 45 minutes for 
15-20 weeks.  Teachers assess students once or every two weeks or as needed to analyze the rate and level of student 
performance.   The school uses TCRWP writing assessments to assess progress in writing, Fountas and Pinnell Reading and 
Writing assessments to assess reading comprehension and reading levels, as well as the Wilson Language Fundations 
Assessments to assess  students' phonemic awareness, phonics skills, vocabulary, and fluency. Teachers also use teacher-
created materials designed to assess student understanding and mastery of various lessons and units taught in English 
Language Arts and Mathematics.  For ELLs, the NYSESLAT (in the Spring) , and the NYISTELL (upon entering as a new student at 
the beginning of the year) are also given to students.       The school will use all of the data to identify and evaluate student 
needs and well as to create and differentiate student groupings in all Tier levels.  The school then examines the student data to 
monitor student growth and analyze the needs of students by population and academic and grade levels to then consider 
teaching practices and curriculum.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our data is gleaned from the NYSESLAT and the yearly ELA examinations for grades 3-5. Data for subgroups (at-risk students, 
ELL-SWDs) is analyzed after it is pulled from the EDAT; grade team meetings and ENL/general education teacher meetings 
utilize the data to inform focus areas for the upcoming years' instruction. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

PS 102 shares data from assessments on Monday PD afternoons, as well as PPT meetings, where students needs are assessed 
and addressed. Progress is tracked during Literacy Center time, when all hands on deck (support staff, etc.) teach students in 
the classrooms in small groups. Assessments include, Fountas and Pinnell, Reading and Writing conferencing, iReady, and 
Engage NY. Our school-wide Google Drive keeps the data current and available to all school staff in order to address students' 
needs.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ENL program is implemented through both Stand-Alone and Integrated models as per students’ proficiency levels 
and units suggested.  The ENL program integrates academic language instruction with different content areas (ELA, 
math, social studies, and science) depending on the mandates for different students and the struggles each student 
has; a student who struggles specifically with the causality-based reading required in social studies may receive 
support there in particular, for example. The ENL teacher communicates weekly with teachers about student needs 
and content area teaching. The ENL teacher follows the TCRWP curriculum.  Integrated support in the classroom 
groups ELLs together in small groups during whole class lessons. The ENL teacher then supports students during this 
time.  During Stand-Alone, the ENL teacher supports students in small groups of <10 students across two grade levels 
and two proficiency levels.  Instruction is also differentiated for each child’s academic needs.   The integrated model 
allows for the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher to discuss student progress, plan lessons, and discuss 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

differentiation strategies and ENL supports for ELL in the classroom. When the ENL teacher pushes-in the classroom, 
she works with students in small groups inside of  the classroom.  Students work on the same content that the 
teacher is teaching, but with guided support from the ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher integrates during ELA, Social 
Studies, or Math.

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The ENL teacher creates a list of all students, their proficiency levels, and the number of minutes required for their 
levels.  The ENL teacher then collaborates with all classroom teachers to discuss scheduling and minutes required for student 
services. Integrated services run 45 minutes per session and ELL students are grouped together within the class to support 
them.  As a result of the mandate, the Stand Alone model is provided by the ENL teacher in a separate location when students 
are dispersed across many classrooms.   
     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  The ENL teacher provides ELLs with English instruction using ENL methodology in both a Stand-Alone model and the 
integrated model.  Adapted instructional strategies are also used throughout the content areas of ELA, Mathematics, Science, 
and Social Studies.  A balanced literacy approach and mini-lessons are  used with a focus on ENL strategies (integrated text-
based grammar, sentence combining, use of instructional scaffolds like visuals, graphic organizers, and explicit modeling from 
teachers and peers). Instruction is grade, content, and age appropriate. The ENL teacher challenges students by focusing on 
specific tasks which drive higher order thinking skills in all four ENL modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing, as 
well as using differentiation to make learning comprehensible. The  ENL teacher also considers student proficiency levels and 
uses students' L1 to build schema and develop home language to strengthen students' L2. Methods also include scaffolding, 
purposeful grouping, building background knowledge, and and extended discussion (as per the SIOP method); all are also used 
in the classroom and in the ENL program.  Content and language objectives are systematically woven into the curriculum.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

       We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year by conferring with teachers, 
students, and families to determine the best language for assessments. The ENL teacher and the Assistant Principal will 
collaborate with classroom teachers to ensure that students are provided with the assessments that best meet the students' 
needs. Students who are observed to be more literate in their home languages are provided with appropriate assessments in 
that language (where possible) to track progress and compare proficiencies between languages.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) Though we do not have any SIFE students currently, if they were to register in the school, they would be served as follows: 
aside from receiving stand-alone and integrated instruction as per the CR 154 mandate, they will be given intensive small 
group reading instruction to help them shore up their literacy skills, phonemic awareness, and other lacking areas in English. 
(based on a group assessment by teachers X, Y, and Z, we would support them in the modalities requiring the most support. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

We would obtain for them 
 b) Newcomer students are given support and minutes as per the mandate of CR 154 depending on their level of English 
language proficiency as per the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores they receive. Newcomer students may receive priority support in 
the ELA content area, or the other content areas in particular on the basis of formative assessments. Collaboration with 
content area teachers of these students is a priority regardless of whether integrated services are provided during their 
periods or not; ENL teachers provide all content area teachers will strategies and scaffolds to help them reach these students. 
Students are supported in the acculturation process as well, through careful seat assignments and empathic interactions. 
c) Developing ELLs are gradually eased off the scaffolds provided to newcomer students as their language proficiency scores on 
the NYSESLAT increase. Special attention is provided to academic literacy and writing at this stage to help ensure that students 
do not become part of the Long-Term ELL subgroup. 
d) Though we do not have any long-term ELLs currently, if they were to register in the school, they would be served as follows: 
they would receive targeted academic literacy and writing intervention to help them access the language of complex texts and 
produce complex texts themselves. Areas of deficiency would be specifically targeted with both the work done with the 
general education teacher and supplemental assignments. 
e) Former ELLs are to receive content-area support depending on their struggles or strengths based on the mandate; 
collaboration with content area teachers continues, so as to ensure that assignments and instruction are sufficiently scaffolded 
to ensure access. Students continue to receive accommodations in testing. Students may act as peer models or peer tutors for 
other ELL students to help their lower-efficiency peers. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs that are identified as having special needs are instructed in a small group standalone or integrated setting with the ENL 
teacher (as well as the content area teacher).  The ENL teacher collaborates closely with general education teachers to plan 
and differentiate learning. The Wilson Reading System is used to support phonics and phonemic awareness; teachers of ELLs 
also offer students multiple study skill strategies, and vocabulary support. Small group support targets language acquisition 
while covering grade appropriate material. Teachers of ELL-SWDs integrate a number of methods, including targeted 
vocabulary instruction (high-impact Tier 2 words taught explicitly with modeling and repetition), differentiated literacy 
instruction in each of the content areas (focusing on the required structures and text types common to each area) and 
sustained visual and graphic support during lessons. ELL-SWDs are also often the target of small-group instruction by ICT 
teachers, if they are in such a classroom, or if they have any other access to additional adults in the room. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
To ensure ELL-SWDs are serviced in the least restrictive environment, all self-contained and mainstream classrooms (ICT and 
SETSS) with students with IEPS follow the common core standards to design curriculum with ENL strategies and differentiation 
for all ELLs. All students participate in the general education ELA programs which are modified to address student needs.  All 
pull-out support is designed by reading level and NYSESLAT level, regardless of IEP status; however IEP goals are followed and 
modifications and supports for ELLs are implemented as needed, where they are observed to be beneficial. ENL services are 
scheduled around other federally mandated services for ELL-SWDs.   
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  
The language of instruction is English.  The teacher in the classroom conducts Tier 1 strategies as needed for ELLs. Those ELLs 
requiring Tier II interventions are supported during morning intervention period.  Additionally, ELL-SWDs whose IEPs mandate 
it receive support from SETSS and ICT teachers in small groups.  The afterschool programs are also targeted intervention 
programs that support students in ELA and Mathematics. The literacy coach supports the school by providing access to 
resources so that teachers may utilize during Guided reading.  She also provides PD to teachers how to implement the various 
reading programs. Targeted interventions for Social Studies and Science are developing content specific language, providing

support through technology, realia , and videos.  Targeted intervention also occurs by supporting students in small group and 
providing reading material that is on level with student independent reading (such as Read Works or StarFall).   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

No new programs are being considered for the upcoming year.  
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs participate in all school programs, such as art, music, technology, physical education. Parents of ELLs have the option to 
register their children in after-school/supplemental services which are offered to all students in the school, i.e. KidsCreative, 
etc... ELL students participate in all school programs (curricular and extracurricular) and are fully represented in all 
programs.  Our ELLs are the intended beneficiaries of all the resources and monies the school receives.  Another supplemental 
service we offer ELLs is an online fluency program called Mind-Play.  This helps the school to track students' literacy growth as 
well as their comprehension.  ELLs are invited to participate through invitations from the school, classroom teachers , the ENL 
teacher.  The teachers document the activities the students participates in using a spreadsheet that records all of the functions 
and programs each ELL child has participated in.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials used to support ELLs range from Fluency and Comprehension Kits such as Text Talk, Quick Reads, 
Comprehension Matters, TC book lists, the TCRWP Writing Curriculum, the iReady Reading Program, and the Wilson Reading 
Program Fundations. We also have access to the librarian who provides out of classroom book titles.  Regarding websites for 
reading resources, we provide access to Reading A-Z, Brain Pop, and Star Fall. Technology support includes the use of laptops, 
iPads, and a technology laboratory. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the ENL program, home language (HL) support is achieved through leveraging it as a resource to express oneself 
(translanguaging); students are encouraged to use both English and their HL when answering questions, writing, and learning 
vocabulary, where cognates are helpful.  HL support is also provided through cultural awareness and experiences in the school 
by holding school-wide cultural events where everyone is welcome to participate.  The school also provides bilingual books in 
Spanish and English.  For students whose HL is not Spanish, students are invited to create bilingual books in their home 
language and English, as well as write oral stories in their home language. The ENL program focuses on home language support 
by raising cultural awareness through reading material in the child's home language such as stories, music, and poetry.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Support services, such as counseling, occupational therapy, and physical therapy are provided, as needed, to ELL students (as 
per their IEPs).  P.S. 102 also has a school-based support personnel: a bilingual social worker (Mr. O'Connor) and a school 
psychologist (Mr. David) who serve all needy students, including ELLs when warranted.  The services provided correspond to 
ELLs' age and grade level.  Required services (as per students' IEPs) are provided by the speech teachers, counselor, social 
worker, SETSS and IEP teachers and classroom teachers.    All of our materials are academically appropriate for the individual 
levels of each learner, age, and grade.  The Instructional Coach keeps track of all leveled books, curriculum resources, and 
classroom library books for the entire school.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our building is colocated with a D75 school, P169, sharing a single floor (the 3rd floor) with all other spaces accessible to both 
schools. ELLs have access to all specialized areas (the library, the computer lab, the garden) throughout the school week 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

through coordinated scheduling that ensures no group from either school overlaps with the time of another group. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At this point in time, we have no programs currently in place to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school 
year. New ELLs are supported through a 'buddy system,' wherein they are seated nearby students known to be patient and 
caring based on prior experience, and the buddy is told to show the student around throughout the day and guide him or her 
to each location. The school counselor is also available to support ELLs so they may get acclimated to the culture of the school, 
should it be necessary.  The parent coordinator is also available to invite and work with ELL parents in supporting their child's 
literacy and school experiences and help them integrate into the school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 No language electives are offered at our school (K-5 school). 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff Workshop on supporting ELLs by sheltering instructionStaff Workshop for ELLs and promoting literacy through the 
content areas of Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies 
Staff Workshop on ELL performance reflections -June 2018 
 For teachers of ELLs and the ENL teacher, professional development is offered within PS 102 using the professional 
development plan and attended by or led by faculty members. The Common Core Learning Standards are discussed and 
used  for curriculum planning. The Instructional Coach, school leaders, and teachers meet weekly to discuss instruction, design 
curriculum aligned to CCLS.  The staff develops plans to include all learners and differentiated approaches to help students 
meet the standards and challenging content. The ENL teacher attends borough and district-wide professional development.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
This year the ENL teacher plans to attend workshops on NYSESLAT Scoring, Improving Outcomes for ELL-SWDs, and Serving 
ELLs and Their Families, as well as other available workshops that crop up throughout the year.All staff are involved in 
receiving professional development.  PD workshops (in-house) are given in both ELA and Math.  These workshops are aligned 
with the Core standards.  Professional development will focus on teachers supporting all students, including ELLs, as they 
engage these students in the CCLS (rigorous tasks and higher order thinking strategies).All staff receive the requisite hours of 
ELL training; the above-mentioned workshop plan would constitute 15% of in-school hours as required by Part 154. The ENL 
teacher attends additional PD outside of the school, held by the district, to ensure that 50% of his hours are ENL-related.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In alignment with CR 154, meetings are scheduled individually with the parents of each ELL, beginning in the early spring, held 
during Parent Engagement Time on Tuesdays or as necessary to accommodate for parents' schedules. During these meetings, 
interpretorsor translators are present to ensure parental comprehension, and the presentation of their childs' progress 
throughout the year, gleaned from summative and formative assessments and noteworthy pieces of work the child has 
submitted, is couched in parent-friendly language. Parents are shown how their children have progressed from last year, based 
on their development in areas of concern from the previous years' NYSESLAT, among the other above-mentioned assessments. 
Prior to each meeting, content-area teachers work with the ENL teacher to finalize a unified opinion on the child's progress 
since the previous year based on their work in each content area.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

This year, the parent coordinator will remind ELL parents that there is a DOE website and a school site full of information 
pertaining to their child's education that can keep them informed about up-coming events.  For example, there is a flyer (in 7 
different languages) about curriculum night and Parent-Teacher Nights which the parent coordinator  distributes to all parents, 
including parents of ELLs. The parent coordinator and ENL teacher will also inform the parents about the community based 
organizations who partner with our school: Union Settlement, Kids Creative and the YMCA.  The parent coordinator has an 
'Open Door' policy where forms, surveys, and letters can be dropped off.  She uses her own parent survey form to determine 
the optimal time for meetings, and which day of the week parents are available, and which are more convenient.  Her survey 
form asks parents to list their hobbies and interests, and to let her know what questions or information are needed.  She then 
develops workshops that reflect the results of this survey.  The ENL teacher works closely with teachers, staff and parents to 
facilitate any concern or issue that may arise during the school day or at a parent-teacher meeting.  The goal of her activities is 
to engage parents (including the parents ELLs) in their children's education.  Parents with no access to a computer can view 
DOE videos in her office or during  workshop sessions.   The Parent Coordinator holds parent workshops that supports parents' 
interest in literacy at home, mathematical thinking, and homework support.  Books are suggested, read alouds and 
demonstrations are given, math games are molded and practiced. Parents are also invited to help plan functions for the school 
such as multicultural events, family nights, and family dances. Tentatively, workshops for parents in general and parents 
of ELLs in particular will be held monthly. They would be as follows: 
On the second Tuesday of November, a workshop introducing parents of ELLs to one another by creating a decorative 
scrapbook with information about their lives. 
On the second Tuesday of December, a workshop introducing parents of ELLs to the ELL experience in New York City schools as 
well as available resources. 
On the second Tuesday of January, a workshop on building literacy in young ELLs. 
On the second Tuesday of Februrary, a workshop on helping your child write more frequently and encouraging his or her 
progress in writing. 
On the second Tuesday of March, a workshop on preparing for the state tests and what to expect. 
On the second Tuesday of April, introduction to a number of language-promoting board games and encouragement to use 
them with one's children. 
On the second Tuesday of May, the compilation of a school cookbook featuring recipes from each of the parents. 
On the second Tuesday of June, showcasing of the ELL students' growth over the year, as well as strategies to help one's child 
maintain his or her growth over the summer.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gaynell Taylor, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

School Notices, Parent Surveys, and all school information is done in both languages (English and Spanish) to 
provide families with information with in the school. Our bilingual Parent Coordinator also provides assistance in 
translating during parent meetings with the school. The information is looked at through HLIS, ATS, or parent 
request to know what the preferred language of communication is.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
