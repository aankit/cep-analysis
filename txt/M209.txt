Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission: The Hamilton Grange School is a public middle school founded on the principle that hard work breeds talent, 
intelligence and success. Through a curriculum devoted to challenging readings, thoughtful debate, argumentative 
writing, problem solving, and character education, we prepare our students to consistently strive to reach further and 
embrace rigor and hard work to better themselves and their communities.  

We believe that kids learn best when they are "doing:" experimenting, applying their knowledge and skills to attack a 
new challenge, and creating new understandings. It is this belief, and the recognition that college and career

readiness is achieved through the ability to read, write and speak effectively, that makes authentic literacy the 
essential element of every one of our lessons.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Hamilton Grange Middle School (06M209) was established in September 2014 to serve the needs of families in the 
Hamilton Heights community of West Harlem. In the 2017-18 school year we've been named as the only grade 6 - 8 
Reward School for Progress in all of New York State and in 2018-19 we enter our second year as the New York City 
Department of Education's Showcase School for Redefining Discipline. As a "Limited Unscreened" school, students do 
not need to take an exam to be accepted to the school. Admissions is via a lottery system with priority given to 
students enrolled at PS 192 and those who have attended one of our Open Houses. The nature of this admissions 
process means that our school serves a diverse group of learners: our students come from 11 different countries, 
speak no less than 8 languages, and represent all of district 6 from 135th Street to 218th Street. We serve diverse 
learners of all kinds - students with disabilities and English language learners included.  

Community Involvement, whether in the form of SLC, Open Houses, or partnerships with Community Based 
Organizations, has been a great strength of the school. Highlights of the aforementioned collaborations include, but 
are not limited to: 

Creative Art Works (CAW), America Scores New York, Harlem Educational Activities Fund, Mt. Sinai/St. Luke’s and 
the Heritage Health Clinic, Urban Advantage, the Roberts Foundation, CHAMPS Sports, Sadie Nash Girls' 
Leadership, College Access for All, NYC DDC Engineering Initiative, Columbia University’s Millennium Cities 
Initiative, CITYarts, SuitUp NYC, Junior Achievement, Columbia University, the City College of New York, The 
People’s Theater Project, Arts Matter Initiative, Makeosity, BEAM, Fresh Youth Initiatives, Councilman Mark Levine 
and Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We are classified as a Title I school, 31% of our students are learning English as a New Language and 23% of our 
students have Individualized Education Plans. We serve a wide spectrum of learners, and as a result, provide Wilson 
Reading System and Wilson Just Words intervention for those students reading well below grade level, SETTS and ICT 
services, English As A New Language, and employ a wide array of pedagogical strategies to engage all students from 
group learning techniques to planning for movement in the classroom as a means of productively channeling the 
energies of our students.  

And because middle school is the most formative time of our children's lives, the Hamilton Grange community 
supports our students, families and staff members in recognizing that mistakes are inevitable, and essential to our 
learning and progress. This understanding extends not only to academics, but to behavior as well. For this reason, 
students are encouraged to retake exams and rewrite essays to better illustrate their mastery of both content and 
skills. We also employ a Collaborative Problem Solving program to support our students in learning from the social 
emotional challenges they encounter, rather than merely punishing them.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the most progress over the past year 
were related to supporting collaborative teachers. In designing our program for the new school year, we not only 
ensured that each grade and content team was afforded dedicated space to meet each week, but also that there was 
a structure for those meeting times. Teams are afforded a selection of options from which they may structure their 
time in an effort to make their meetings as focused and as effective as possible in progressing positive student 
outcomes. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Teachers also came together on a staff retreat before the year began to identify the 7 most essential foundations of 
the school. They identified Literacy, Engagement, Relationships, Collaborative Problem Solving, Growth Mindset, 
Racial Equity and our Hamilton Habits as the pillars that all of our work as school would be supported by. Now, those 
pillars are specifically addressed in curriculum planning, and all team meetings and professional development sessions 
are attached to one or more of the pillars to ensure that the work is aligned to the school staff's priorities.  

The key focus for this year is to create a more supportive environment for our students and our staff. We aim to 
provide the structures necessary to teachers to better enable them to plan with one another in our co-taught 
classrooms to support the diverse learners in those classrooms, and therefore, progress positive student outcomes.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. The school's strengths are in its ability to move both student proficiency scores on the ELA and Math exam as well 
as their reading level over the course of their three years at the school. 

  During their three years at Hamilton Grange, 8th graders taking the 2018 New York State ELA exam increased 
their proficiency level from 13% of students scoring (as 6th graders in the 2015-16 school year) at level 3 and 
4, to 49% of students scoring at these levels (as 8th graders in the 2017-18 school year).  

  During their three years at Hamilton Grange, 8th graders taking the 2018 New York State Math exam 

increased their proficiency level from 17% of students scoring (as 6th graders in the 2015-16 school year) at 
level 3 and 4, to 49% of students scoring at these levels (as 8th graders in the 2017-18 school year).  

  During their three years at Hamilton Grange, 8th graders taking the 2017 New York State ELA exam decreased 
the number of students scoring at level 1 from 56% of students (as 6th graders in the 2014-15 school year), to 
28% of students scoring at this level (as 8th graders in the 2016-17 school year).  

  On the Degrees of Reading Power exam in Oct 2015, the average student score for 6th graders at Hamilton 
Grange was 50.9. In June of 2018 the average student score for those same students (now 8th graders) was 
66.9. Hamilton Grange students' increase of 16 points over these three years surpassed the national average 
increase of 9 points. 

2. The school's priority need is the large number of students who enter the school scoring below proficient on the ELA 
State Exam. For example, 59% of our entering 6th grade class scored below grade level on the 2018 ELA state exam 
taken during their 5th grade year. Although this is a lower number than previous years, it is still a priority area for the 
school and a place where our rigorous instruction can be applied to great effect. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, through the use of the Mastery Connect Assessment System and the Wilson Reading System, Wilson Just 
Words, and the Strategic Reading Period (and accompanying curriculum), 35% of the students scoring at level 1 on the 
NYS ELA exam will reach a level 2 or higher as measured by the subsequent state exam.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Families will first be engaged in monthly workshops with instructional staff including communication via all of our 
social media platforms. Parents are also presented with the school's curriculum in each of the subjects at the 
beginning of the year and given advice for supporting students with their work at home in each of the different 
subjects. In addition, parents are a central part of our Student Led Conferences where students present their work 
and progress to their parents, speaking about the quality of work they have completed and areas where they can 
grow and improve based on rubrics and clear criteria for success. These meetings happen three times a year and are 
coordinated throughout the school. The person responsible for family engagement, implementation and oversight is 
the dedicated parent coordinator at the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. Out schools strengths are building a strong and supportive academic environment where students feel that 
teachers care about them and that they are able to succeed. This is evidenced in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide 
where 83% of students say they get specific suggestions on how to improve when they are confused and 80% of 
students say that teachers explain things a different way if it is not understood the first time. This personal care and 
academic support leads to a greater degree of student engagement in school with 91% of teachers in the same survey 
saying that students follow the rules.  

2. Despite this progress, there are still areas to focus on. For example, in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, only 51% 
of students said that "most" students feel it is important to come to school every day. In addition, only 26% of 
students say that most student behave well even when the teacher is not watching. This presents a significant area 
for improvement in building student autonomy, confidence and responsibility so that they are understand the 
importance of attending, are motivated to come in and have the internal motivation to be engaged with or without 
the teacher watching. 

3. We are implementing a number of strategies to support the whole child throughout the school day. Rather than 
resort to detention and suspensions, punishments that are unsuccessful in teaching a student the skills they need to 
behave in a different manner, the Hamilton Grange school community is interested in better supporting students in 
their social and emotional development and not contributing to the "School-to-Prison Pipeline." We do this through 
the use of the Collaborative Problem Solving Approach, a research proven practice which all of our teachers have 
been trained in to deal with the most challenging students.  

Using restorative practices to foster positive interpersonal and intergroup relations and to address inappropriate 
behavior when it occurs is a cornerstone of a progressive approach to discipline. A restorative approach to discipline 
changes the fundamental questions that are asked when a behavioral incident occurs. Instead of asking who is to 
blame and how those engaged in the misbehavior will be punished, a restorative approach asks students to reflect on 
their own actions and their effects.  

We also use the Class Dojo program combined with our Hamilton Habits, to encourage positive actions and the 
developing of personal qualities that will be useful both within and outside the classroom. In addition, we are also 
implementing an advisory structure which builds students social and emotional skills while creating a safe and 
supportive environment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

  By June 2019, all Hamilton Grange teachers will collaboratively plan and facilitate Collaborative Problem 

Solving "Plan B" conversations through weekly Tuesday meetings to improve school culture as measured by 
the development and implementation of at least 10 individual student plans and behavior tracking analyses.

Despite the tremendous progress made on the New York State ELA exam in 2018 (see Section 5A), Hamilton Grange 
students averaged a score of 2.55 compared to the Citywide average of 2.8/4 on the 7th grade ELA exam, 2.53 
compared to the Citywide average of 2.96/4 on the 6th grade ELA exam, and incoming 6th graders at Hamilton 
Grange averaged a score of 2.48 compared to the Citywide average of 2.72/4 on the 5th grade ELA exam.  

1. To be clear, the relative strengths here are that our students are improving on the NYS ELA Exam across all grades 
through a concerted effort on the part of teachers and teacher teams to make research-backed effective literacy 
practices the foundation of all content areas.  

2. The priority need that this goal and action plan will address is providing a more deliberate structure for these 
teacher teams to use data in a way that further improves student outcomes and allows our students to lessen the 
performance gap between them and their peers throughout the City on the NYS ELA exam.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 80% of students who scored below grade level will see a 30% improvement on the NYS ELA and/or math 
state exam. Progress will be measured by quarterly benchmark exams aligned to the state exam.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Strategies for recruitment include reaching out to networks: Teach for America, Teach for America alumni, Teaching 
Fellows, current staff's professional networks of teachers, as well as the Department of Education's New Teacher 
Finder and Open Marker Transfer System. 

Strategies for retention include our mentoring program in which all teachers new to Hamilton Grange and those on 
TIP plans or who are probationary are paired with a more veteran teacher rated effective or highly effective in the 
prior year and throughout the year engage together in a weekly cycle of observation and feedback.  

 

Additionally, all teachers are members of a Japanese Lesson Plan study team that allows each department within the 
school to partake in a minimum of 4 cycles of action research and collaborative planning to improve practice and 
student outcomes.  

 

Teacher assignments are made based first on teacher preference and certification, then on their expertise and 
experience in each grade's content and students' development, and finally on their ability to effectively collaborate 
with their co-teachers.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Principal receives high quality professional development through twice monthly meeting with the superintendent's 
office and additionally, through his work with the Showcase Schools, Mastery Collaborative and the Middle School 
Quality Initiative. More individual professional development for the principal is afforded through the PPO observation 
process. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

Paraprofessional professional development is administered through the cycle of support provided at the district wide

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers collaborate with administration weekly in Monday and Tuesday PD meetings and a minimum of once each 
week in departmental meetings - these times are used to look at student data on assessments to better inform 
instruction. Teachers, with administration, create assessments with the help of Fluence assessment bank to ensure 
high quality and rigorous assessments. Professional development via the Master Teacher Series and collaborative 
planning between partner schools will further serve these goals. Funds will be used to hire High Quality teachers so in 
nearly all classes there are two teachers available to support all students in learning at the highest levels.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Hamilton Grange Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Hamilton Grange Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,  

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Student Led Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Title III funds will support two programs: a Saturday program and an in school/after school 
theater program designed specifically for entering and emerging ENLs.  
 
Saturday program is designed for ENL students requiring additional language support beyond 
that of what they receive during the regular school week. It aims to target students who not only 
struggle with English as a New Language, but also in content areas. The ultimate objective of the 
program is to increase student's linguistic abilities, which will help improve their overall 
performance in content areas. The grades that will be serviced will include sixth, seventh and 
eighth. Within these groups, the target demographics will be primarily students who are: 
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning. Expanding and Commanding students will be selected 
based upon weekly academic performance in the content area. However, the makeup of students 
will consist primarily of the three former categories in consideration of the fact that they 
consistently require the most assistance. The program will last from 9am-12pm, from 9/22/18 to 
6/22/19 (excluding holidays - a total of 36 sessions) and students will be asked to attend for the 
entire duration of the program. The language of instruction will be English. The focus, or theme 
of the program, will be guided reading during the one and one half hour of ENL instruction, and 
ENL supports provided to our ENLs during the one and one half hour of study in the content area 
of math. To clarify, each Saturday session will be comprised of two classes, an ENL class for the 
aforementioned students and ENL supports within the math classroom.  
During the guided reading period (one and one half hour for each of two groups) the split 
between fiction and non-fiction texts will be 50-50. Materials purchased for the guided reading 
will come largely from the Perfection Learning Fountas and Pinnell Guided Reading Packs in 
Levels D through Q, again with 50% of funds being devoted to fiction texts, and 50% being 
devoted to non-fiction texts. These texts will be used exclusively for the Saturday ENL 
enrichment program for the duration of the program. 
During the math period (one and one half hour for each of two groups) the students will be 
previewing material for the coming week and reviewing the previous week's learning. The math 
teachers will spend one hour each Saturday (11 am - 12 pm) planning with the ENL teachers to 
ensure that our ENLs have the supports necessary to be successful (compensation will not be 
through Title III funds).   
There will be an ENL certified teacher overseeing the ENL Saturday Academy and this teacher, 
along with the aforementioned math teachers, all will be compensated for their time through a 
minimum use of 60% of all Title III funds. Materials required will consist of student notebooks, 
whiteboards, and markers as well as Guided Reading books at levels commensurate with those 
which these students are currently reading. These books will be purchased using the 20% 
maximum of available for OTPS. Additionally, technology will be required including, but not 
limited to; MacBook’s, smart boards, projectors, and iPads. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

Part C: Professional Development

 
  name of provider 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
In accordance with Chancellor's Regulation, a minimum of 15% of total hours of Professional 
Development for all teachers must be ELL-specific. Furthermore, Bilingual and ESL/ENL 
teachers must receive 50% of their total Professional Development hours from ELL specific PD. 
Professional development for ELL's is particularly important for a school such as ours. With a 
population dominated by English Language Learners, ENL services are of the utmost importance 
in realizing our students' academic success. In doing so, ALL teachers will be administered an 
ENL related PD once a month for the duration of a standard after school professional 
development period. Topics to be covered will focus heavily on how to increase literacy in ELL's 
with an emphasis on Collaborative Strategic Reading and Reciprocal Reading practices. 
Moreover, teachers will be taught various methods in which they can scaffold their curriculum to 
help support ELL's reach content curriculum goals. The provider of said Professional 
Developments will be the ENL instructors from M.S. 209; Mr. Kyle Pecora and Mr. 
Joao Moderno and Ms. Christina Carlson. In order to further expand upon Mr. Pecora's, Mr. 
Moderno's, and Ms. Carlson's knowledge of the field, they will regularly report to outside ELL-
specific PD opportunities offered by The Division of English Language Learners & Student 
Support and take part in the books study groups described below. These book study groups will 
provide the content that ENL teachers use in the professional development that they provide to 
the other teachers on staff (all teachers across content areas exclusive of ENL teachers).  
 
To further benefit the practices stemming from this professional development, teachers of ELLs 
will participate in study groups - books and related resources for these study groups (including 
the books Academic Literacy for English Language Learners: High Quality Instruction Across 
Content Areas and Reading In Secondary Content Areas: A Language Based Approach) will be 
purchased using no more than 10%, or $1,120 of Title III monies. Study groups will focus on one 
strategy each month that ENL teachers will incorporate into their planning and practice in both 
the pull out and push in settings. Study group will occur during the 90 minutes of collaborative 
time that the two ENL teachers are provided each week. These strategies will be shared with 
ENL teachers' intervisitation partners, instructional coaches, and administration so that ENL 
teachers and content area co-teachers can receive support in incorporating these strategies in the 
classroom to improve ELL language acquisition and promote academic English growth. For the 
duration of the book study, ENL teachers will be tasked with selecting strategies that they can 
use to facilitate school wide professional development for their content area peers across three 
(110 minute) professional development sessions in December, February and May. These 
strategies will fall into three broad categories: Research Supported Best Practices for Teaching 
English Language Learners (December), schoolwide protocols to support reading, writing and 
speaking (February) and Integrating Math/Science/Social Studies and Literacy to Support 
English Language Learners (May).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.   

rationale 

 
  schedule and duration 
 
  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Apart from establishing regular, meaningful communication between home and school, the staff 
at M.S.209 will engage parents of ELL's in other relevant ways. This will primarily consist of 
creating a school climate and structures that supports family involvement. This could come in the 
form of volunteer opportunities for parents to come and participate in their child's learning or 
offering workshops on strategies they can utilize at home with their child. Supplies and 
refreshments to encourage parent involvement will constitute no more than $250 of Title III 
funds. 
Our Saturday ESL program for parents will rely on Title III funding to compensate the ESL 
teacher providing the training at the per session rate of $60.65 p/h. The program is designed as 
an ESL program for parents of families of our ENLs so that they may better support the higher 
achievement of their children, our ENLs. The class meets every Saturday from 9:00 am - 12:00 
pm. The program will last from 9am-12pm, from 9/29/18 to 6/22/19 (excluding holidays - a total 
of 36 sessions). Topics to be covered include: beginning English grammar, reading, and 
conversation built around engaging content and polarizing issues such as student use of the 
Internet. The instructor is Ms. Carlson, one of our ENL instructors. Ms. Carlson has experience 
teaching adults in his role as an ENL instructor at the Community College level. Parents will be 
notified via weekly telephone call and via messaging through the Class Dojo application.  
In addition, there needs to be an emphasis on parent communication. This can be done through 
one of the many platforms offered at M.S. 209 including student email, Class Dojo and 
Skedula/PupilPath online gradebook. Parents also need to be kept abreast of regulations that 
apply to their child. This information can be disseminated with follow up in person Q&A 
sessions. The schools ENL providers, Mr. Pecora and Mr. Moderno will oversee the 
implementation of these initiatives.  
 
Translation and Interpretation 
Currently, only one student's family at our school speaks a language not spoken by one or more 
of our staff members. For this student we have set aside monies for translation services at both 
Student Led Conferences, IEP meetings, and more informal instances of communication that 
regularly arise on our parent outreach Tuesdays. 
 
Total cost of all parental involvement initiatives will not exceed more than 10% of Title III 
funds.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At Hamilton Grange we use a variety of tools to assess the early literacy of ENLs. We use the Degrees of Reading Power exam, 
TOSWRF and WIST exams, and Wilson Reading Program and Wilson Just Words assessments to determine English language 
reading level. For students who have acquired oral English skills but lack reading skill we use the WADE from the Wilson 
Reading System to assess phonemic awareness. ENL students' academic progress is monitored through classroom assessments 
containing grade level material. Classroom assessments are analyzed to identify specific areas of need within groups and 
individual students. In general we know that most of our ENLs are reading below grade level according to the DRP. Due to the 
results of the assessments we have begun targeted pull out groups to address students who are reading below grade level.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In weekly professional development meetings and humanities team meetings, grade teams of teachers work together and 
using data from the above-mentioned assessments, school-wide benchmark assessments, and NYS ELA exam, determine 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

appropriate groupings of students along with the accompanying instructional strategies that will best support each group of 
learners who are also ELLs.  
 
ENL teachers work closely with each grade team to plan their role in the classroom, but also to support content teachers with 
research based strategies for supporting the ELLs in their classrooms.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At Hamilton Grange, we evaluate the success of our programs by tracking the progress of our ELL population using the New 
York State Assessments in ELA and Math. We also track English language proficiency levels by monitoring the performance of 
the various categories of ELLs such as Long Term ELLs, Former ELLs, SIFE students and newly arrived with formal schooling. We 
use a variety of assessment instruments such as periodic assessments, unit tests, writing samples in both ESL and ELA, and 
reading and writing conferences. It is expected that all ELLs are proficient in ELA and Math based on grade level unit 
assessments and the NYS ELA and Math exam. At this point in the year we have administered baseline assessments and once 
we administer benchmarks we will be able to further evaluate the success of our ELL programs.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

HGMS uses this data above, and the EDAT, to identify students who require further intervention.  This intervention comes in 
multiple forms, but begins with classroom scaffolds facilitated through ENL push-ins and through whole class instruction using 
strategies and approaches informed by content teachers' co-planning with ENL teachers, as well as the creation of groupings of 
ELLs within classrooms that leads to differentiated instruction. We also use this data to determine which students can benefit 
from RTI (before or after school and/or Saturday Academy). 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We currently only serve students in the 6  th , 7  th , and 8th grades 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
ELLs at Hamilton Grange are making steady progress through NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and math exam, and Degrees of Reading 
Power levels. From 2016-2017, 9% less ELLs scored at level 1 on the NYS ELA exam (21% less in 6th grade and 18% less in 7th 
grade when measuring the same students from year to year), 3% less ELLs in grade 6 and 15% less ELLs in grade 8 scored at 
level 1 on the NYS math exam, and former ELLs showed a 17% increase in level 3 and 4 schoolwide in both the NYS ELA and 
math exams - these gains were 11% and 16% higher than the City's scores on each exam, respectively.  
 
Of the cohort of students that made up the first class of students at Hamilton Grange in 2014, 46% were identified as ELLs. By 
the time they left as 8th graders, only 26% were classified as ELLs, illustrating their progress on the NYSESLAT.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Information is disseminated via Google Drive and data compiled through partnerships with the Achievement Network, Mastery 
Connect, and District Public. Information is reviewed in weekly grade/content meetings and professional development time. 
This provides our staff the opportunity to collectively analyze the data and make connections on a school wide level. This 
information is then used to determine intervention groups and create lesson plans and unit plans that address key needs of 
individual students each and every week.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ESL instruction is delivered through an integrated co-teaching model and a stand alone model. Students travel in 
cohorts with the vast majority of ELLs being grouped together in one class section in each grade (ex; 603, 703, 803). 
These class sections are comprised primarily of students who are TR, EX, or CO. There are a small number of ELLs in 
the ICT class on each grade as well. All of our EN and EM are grouped into the 02 sections of each grade. This allows 
for the ENL teacher to utilize an integrated teaching model with the classroom teacher to provide services according 
to the new CR Part 154.2 requirements. The ENL teachers have weekly planning periods with lead teachers to create 
plans of attack for weekly instructional implementation, groupings, and material modifications. Teachers then take 
turns leading lesson instruction during class time and then will pair off into groupings based on info obtained in the 
EDAT and/or other assessments.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Each ENL student receives at least the minimum mandated number of minutes of ENL as per CR Part 154.2 through 
integrated and stand alone ENL occurring during their regularly scheduled Humanities course. Our EN and EM students receive 
a total of 360 minutes via a combination of standalone, integrated, and Flexibility. Our EN receive 180 standalone and 180 
integrated. EM receive 90 min. of standalone, 180 of integrated, and 90 min flex. TR receives 90 integrated and 90 flex. EX 
receives 180 min. of standalone, 180 of integrated. CO receives 90 minutes of integrated.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In the content areas all ENLs are provided opportunities to utilize their native language to enhance their content acquisition. 
Depending on the proficiency level of the student they may write in their native language, read the same text in their native 
language, and use bilingual glossaries. These approaches allow students to meet the same standards as their peers in the 
content areas while acquiring English skills in their ENL classes. The  Freestanding ENL program uses the High Point curriculum. 
In ELA content we use Expeditionary Learning, and in Math we use Connected Math Program. In the Freestanding stand-alone 
ENL courses, curriculum and  instruction is designed for ENLs to develop their English language skills, so students can succeed 
in the Common Core ELA curriculum. In the integrated ENL courses curriculum and  instruction is designed for ENLs to build 
English language skills through the content area. The stand-alone and the integrated both use methods to include content area 
subject matter, such as science, math, and humanities and English language development methods.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students have opportunities to review their work with adults who speak their native language when working in the content 
areas. Students are provided with opportunities to access information in their native language during classes; using translation 
software, such as Dragon Dictation for translation in flex or integrated courses. In both stand-alone and integrated ENL courses 
texts are provided in the students native language, glossaries, and dictionaries are available in students' native languages, and 
written assessments are available in the students native language to ensure students are evaluated appropriately. The 
teachers assess their literacy skills as well as oral language and vocabulary development. The information accessed is evaluated 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

by the content standards in the content course, the same Common Core content standards are expected to be met by the 
ENLs, the ENLs progress towards proficiency (CO) of the English language is evaluated using supplemental periodic ENL 
assessments.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.) If we acquire them, SIFE students will be serviced through a before-school basic English language skills class. Parents will 
also be informed about the program to give strategies to help the SIFE students at home. SIFE students are also supported by 
ENL/bilingual teachers during the day as well as content area teachers. 
b.) Newcomer ENLs in the school (0-3 years of service) are given much attention based on the fact that they need to acquire 
English language skills at the same as academic language required to prepare for ELA testing after one year, and tests in other 
content areas. These students are taught language through the content areas. All the teachers of ENLs base lessons around a 
content area and infuse discreet language skills and ENL strategies and methodologies into their teaching. As a result students 
will see an increase in English language proficiency (NYSESLAT), while simultaneously preparing for the content area tests. 
ENLs with less than 3 years (Newcomers) receive ENL instruction from the classroom teacher according to the CR Part 154 
mandates of 360 minutes per week for Entering and Emergining level students and 180 minutes per week for Transitioning and 
Expanding students. Commanding ENLs receive 45 minutes each week. ENLs placed in monolingual classes receive small group 
ESL instruction from the ESL teacher in the Freestanding program that follows the CR Part 154 mandates of 360 minutes per 
week for Entering and Emerging level students and 180 minutes per week for Transitioning and Expanding students. 
Instruction is differentiated according to ongoing assessment and based on data taken from both formal and informal 
assessment. 
c.) Most of the ENLs who have received service for 4-6 years are guided toward acquisition of academic language. The past few 
years of NYSESLAT date reveal that the majority of these students are weakest in the reading and writing modalities. Many of 
them have scored proficient in the listening and speaking subcategories of the test. Therefore the teachers of ENLs at the 
school focus their teaching of these students on academic content vocabulary, themes and skills. The integrated ENL classes 
are designed to give the students scaffolded instruction and/or small group attention. 
d.) Long term ENLs in the school are given extra support through specialized instruction from their content teachers. 
e.) Former ENLs are supported by being given tailored language instruction by our stand alone ENL teacher.  
   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENLs with special needs are taught by their classroom teachers as well ESL teachers. These students are taught with both 
Special Education and ESL instructional strategies and methodologies such as the SIOP model for collaborative structures 
within classes. Students with special needs get support from a SETSS teacher,  and an adaptive physical education teacher. 
Students’ progress is frequently discussed and evaluated and further strategies pursued accordingly. We provide AIS in ELA 
and Math through the services of an AIS teacher and Bilingual Coordinator/AIS specialist. Whenever we receive them we will 
be using our Title III funds for an ENL after-school programs that will include ENL-SWDs. Humanities classroom teachers are 
assisted by an ENL specialist in their classes. Materials are grade level, but often chunked or modified to allow our ELL's-
SWD's to access the content. This specialist helps teachers design and implement lessons that are tailored specifically for ELL's 
and SWD's. These tailored lessons include various strategies to help ELL's-SWD's engage in work. It could be a 
chunked/redacted text, graphic organizers, sentence stems/starters, or other scaffolds. In addition, the specialist helps 
students connect with vocabulary by preteaching, providing visual aides, as well as introducing students to fix up strategies 
that they can then use while reading (ex; prefixes, suffixes, cognates, etc.) Furthermore,  the ENL specialist will assist in 
grouping students appropriately. They will also work closely with these subgroups in a small group setting for either a 
reteach or scaffolded guided practice. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
To service the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs the school allows for students to remain in the least restrictive environment 
whenever possible. SETSS teachers use an integrated model to service the students to enhance their grade level academic 
curriculum. ENL-SWD students are given the same rigorous grade level content as their peers. Teachers scaffold and use 
strategies to allow students to access this material through multiple entry points. Students are placed into ICT classes based 
the recommendations set forth in their IEPs. Curriculum is created with a focus on building background knowledge necessary 
to better enable a diverse set of readers to engage in grade level text.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide AIS in English for students needing additional support in ELA and Math. Students with special needs are supported 
through this program. We currently do not have any SIFE students but we are prepared to provide all SIFE students with 
instruction by the ESL Teachers. We will be using our future Title III funds to support our ENLs in an ESL/NLA after school 
program. We provide enrichment periods each week for students to meet in small groups with their content area teachers to 
receive targeted interventions in Spanish. Transitioning ENLs are the focus of these efforts. Reading intervention programs in a 
stand alone setting occur between 3 - 5 times per week depending on the need of the student. Transitioning ENLs are seen 3 
times, while Entering and Emerging ENLs receive this support 5 times each week.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Some new programs and improvements have begun based on our growing population of ENLs. An  ESL teacher supports 
newcomer and struggling ENLs through both an integrated and stand alone model. We have hired an additional ESL teacher 
and hope to hire one more for the coming year so that there is one ESL teacher supporting students in each grade, allowing 
them to better support students in the curriculum of that grade. We are also monitoring parent interest to check whether 
there is sufficient demand to create a dual language or transitional bilingual program. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Due to the fact that we are a growing school we do not plan to discontinue any ENL programs for next year. We did not close 
any bilingual programs and never have.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ENLs have equal access to all school programs at Hamilton Grange as all programs accommodate all students, including those 
learning English as a new language through translated directions and texts and buddying up students with fellow speakers of 
the same language to further support their participation. All ENLs participate in our art, physical education and debate 
programs, and participate in chess, journalism, and other clubs. ENL students are encouraged to participate in after school 
programs with our community partners. ENLs are instructed by all teachers throughout the school with support from ESL 
teachers in both an integrated and stand alone setting.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ENLs have access to a wide range of instructional materials include Macbooks and iPads euipped with Google Translate and 
LightSail reading applications. All texts are provided in both English and the native language, but also in audio format so 
students can follow along even if they are not yet readers. Classrooms are equipped with projectors, computers and document 
cameras. ELA is taught using the Expeditionary Learning literacy program. Mathematics is taught using CMP3. In science 
students are using FOSS kits for their lab instruction. In debate class students have access to laptops for research purposes. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students receive native language support throughout the day. In standalone ENL students are encouraged to use their native 
language when it helps them produce or interpret English in classroom activities. Books, websites, and resources are provided 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

in the students’ native language through NewsELA, LightSail app, and via native language editions of teacher-created work 
packets and texts.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services support ENLs at their age and grade level. In ELA students have access to translated versions of their grade-
level texts. In AIS for ELA ENLs receive instruction using the Wilson Reading Program to support students reading far below 
grade level. All instruction for ENLs however is age and grade-level appropriate being that it is designed to meet the Common 
Core and Next Generation Science standards of the content and grade. All ENLs are enrolled in core content classes that 
correspond to each student's grade and age level.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share resources with the school we are co-located with.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly arrived students receive an orientation given by the ESL teacher/ELL coordinator. He meets with the students and 
parents to answer any questions about the school or school in the United States. The families are then shown around the 
school campus and they have an opportunity to meet with the staff at the school. This process does not change for students 
who enroll during the school year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered to ENLs. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our school philosophy is that the best professional development happens through the interactions of members of the school 
community and their focused collaborations. To this end, academic specialists, when needed, will support our teachers in 
school whenever possible so that the application of the new learning is observed immediately. 
Teachers of English Language Learners will be trained throughout the year in the understanding and use of Common Core 
standards. These trainings will include in depth analysis of the expectations set forth by the new standards in writing, reading 
and math. Each session provides teachers with action steps that can be implemented the following day. Teachers will receive 
ongoing training in the development of rigorous writing tasks, rubric utilization to score student work and the identification of 
instructional strategies to address writing deficiencies. 
Teachers of ELLs will receive training by the principal in the process of collaborative inquiry manifested through Professional 
Learning Teams. Teachers will receive ongoing training in looking at student work, identifying areas of need, identifying 
instructional strategies to address needs and strengths and the implementation of those strategies. Teacher teams will also 
learn to plan effective lessons and to discuss their effectiveness through the analysis of informal assessments. Through this 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

process, teachers will identify a group of ELL students who will become their inquiry focus. 
Teachers of ELLs will be taking part in book study sessions led by the ELL teacher. During the book study lessons, designed by 
teachers for teachers, teachers will learn strategies to teach writing as well as ESL methodologies to convey new knowledge to 
our students. Classroom teachers of ELLs are scheduled to plan their lessons with our ESL teachers. ESL teachers model ESL 
methodologies for classroom teachers on a regular basis. 
When students come to our middle school we provide an orientation at the beginning of the year that introduces them to how 
our schools functions.  
All teachers receive 7.5 hours (10 hours for special education teachers) from workshops and strategy modeling during the 
Professional Development sessions held on Mondays.  
   
See above.  
 
Professional Development for non-pedagogic staff is administered by the principal to office staff so they are aware that 
registration must always take place with the ENL coordinator present to administer the HLIS. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
School meets the 15% of total hours for all teachers by carving out 15% of our Monday/Tuesday PDs to workshops led by the 
ENL team in coaching teachers on strategies to be used in their classroom for their ENL students.  
 
50% of total hours for ENL teachers are provided in the same way with ENL staff turnkeying PD received through the division of 
ELLs to the rest of the ENL certified staff at the school.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Goals of the ENL program an students' progress and assessment results are discussed at each Student Led Conference 
throughout the year ( a minimum of two times). The schoo has created Individualized Student Reports that share information 
from NYS ELA and Math exams, NYSESLAT exam, Degrees of Reading Power assessment, and benchmark assessments. 
 
Parents are invited through text message, phone call and email as well as the Class Dojo messaging application. The content 
area teachers and the student's advisor conduct the meeting with an ENL teacher. Parents who are unable to attend are able 
to conduct th meeting on the phone. Records of these meetings are kept in Google Drive.  
 
Translation is done by the staff or with a phone call to the TIU. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

ELL parents are part of the SLT and PA and volunteer on field trips and during potlucks and dances that the school holds 
regularly throughout the year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Benjamin Lev, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
