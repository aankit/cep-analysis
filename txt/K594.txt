Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At Gotham Professional Arts Academy--a small Community Learning School--we believe in training young people as 
lifelong learners who advocate for themselves and their community. We promote self-sufficiency, empowerment, and 
independence through a rigorous, inquiry based approach in science, math, the humanities, and the arts. Academics 
combine with wellness-related experiences and activities, enabling students to better understand themselves as 
learners and community members.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Gotham students consider NYC to be their classroom and enjoy access to and ownership of NYC’s resources. As a 
Community Learning School, we invest in the development of the whole person by establishing partnerships for both 
in-school and out-of-school supports. By providing a safe, supportive school community, we embrace and celebrate 
each child. We create opportunities for academic achievement, connectedness, and pride through community events 
such as PBAT presentations and Exhibition Nights, both of which highlight the performance-based tasks that make our 
Consortium community unique. These events celebrate student accomplishments with the whole school and the 
wider community. 

 

Gotham is a Community Learning School Partner 

During the 2014-15 school year, Gotham Academy was designated a UFT Community Learning Partner School. The 
community school model is something we have been familiar with for some time. Part of our school’s founding 
mission is to serve as a connector between the students we serve and arts-based resources in the city. We have 
formed partnerships that have given students’ access to the elite arts institutions of the city. In wasn’t long after our 
founding that we learned: in order to accomplish our more student-centered goals we must engage the family and 
community as a whole. 

With that understanding we forged meaningful partnerships with community-based organizations like The Brooklyn 
Movement Center and Bailey’s Café. Both organizations have helped us increase our programs for both students and 
parents. Our work together has shown how empowering such partnerships can be and has given us insight into how 
we might expand. In particular, The Brooklyn Movement Center’s district-wide needs assessment entitled “Raising 
The Stakes: Investing in a Community School Model to Lift Student Achievement in District 16” has begun to 
illuminate the potential of our school if we are able expand our conception of a school as a connector into school as 
connector and hub.  

It is our hope that the supports provided through the Community School Learning Initiative can help us go deeper into 
the nuances of our community’s needs and build upon our strengths as a small, progressive, arts school. Fortifying 
these strengths would allow us to utilize them to support our community with increased arts programs, college and 
career services for students and families, and comprehensive health services.  

We are looking at a model for staff and community engagement which combines a themed pedagogical approach, 
community needs assessment and integrated arts programming. It is a model used by Brooklyn based arts-and-social-
change organizations such as El Puente Leadership Centers and Urban Bushwomen. Many of our in-school arts and 
academic departments have experience with this model and it offers a training opportunity for the various teaching 
artists we work with. This model marries our mission with our goal of engaging and empowering our larger 
community through the arts. 

Gotham Academy has always built curricula that investigate community issues that are relevant to our students. We 
begin each school year with a two-week intensive inquiry project that focuses on a community issue.  

Gotham Puts a Priority on Community Engagement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We have established many partnerships that align with our mission of serving as a connector between students and 
arts-based and youth-development programs. Below are highlights of our on-going partnerships that are poised for 
expansion. 

  Restorative Justice Circles: Nearly half of our staff has now received training in restorative justice practices 

and will be incorporating these protocols and strategies in advisories as well as core academic classes. 

  College Access for All: Gotham Academy is partnering with the College Access for All initiative to increase the 

supports for students on the path to college and offer more robust workshops and support for families. 

  Peer Group Connection: Gotham Academy is investing in a mulit-year peer mentoring program that pairs 

 

upper grade mentors with 9th grade mentees. The mentors will be trained to conduct circles with mentees, 
supporting the shift to restorative justice practices going on school-wide. 
Steve’s Camp and Healthy Heart, Healthy Body, Healthy Mind: Steve’s Camp is a leadership development 
program that invites groups of NYC students to summer work experiences on a farm in upstate New York. 
Based on the enthusiastic participation of our students in their camp program, the organizers of Steve’s Camp 
have written a grant proposal to launch Healthy Heart, Healthy Body, Healthy Mind at Gotham Academy. This 
new program planned for the 2017-18 school year will combine workshops in nutrition, healthy habits, 
gardening, and fitness activities with workshops promoting college readiness. 

  Expanding the Arts: In 2016 Gotham Academy applied for and received the ETA grant from the Tony Bennett 

Foundation to expand our arts programming. This four year grant comes with professional development 
support from the ETA organization and access to supplemental grants to support the arts for all students at 
Gotham Academy. 

We have also worked closely with the Brooklyn Movement Center to engage our parent community. Not only did our 
PTA executive board attend BMC’s parent leadership workshop, but BMC staff worked closely with our larger parent 
community in efforts to maximize parent leadership and voice at our school. They also advised us on parent 
engagement strategies that have helped us boost attendance at our various parent events throughout the year. 

We began the previous school year with our “Path to Graduation” parent-involvement event. At this event we created 
workshops for students and families focused on college and career readiness goals at each grade level, and brought in 
community partners that offer after-school opportunities to advertise their programs. 

Later in the year we conducted focus groups with our PTA to determine academic and non-academic needs they felt 
the school could support with time and/or resources. The information generated from that focus group initiated our 
next parent event – “Understanding the Teenage Mind.” For this event, we invited a community-based licensed social 
worker to facilitate a workshop for our parents on adolescent development. This was also an opportunity to connect 
parents to community resources and supports they could engage if needed. 

Our most recent parent event was “Launching the College Process.” Here, we invited 11th grade students and their 
parents to learn about the college application process. We also convened alumni parents and students to serve on a 
panel to answer questions on college life, financial aid and navigating the process. We ended by providing parents and 
students with a list of resources they could take advantage of this year, through the summer, and into next academic 
year. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We currently have about 24% students with IEPs. These students require additional supports in the classroom (we 
have developed a robust ICT model) as well as additional supports provided by our guidance counselor, social worker, 
and special ed. coordinator. We also have a substantial number of students who are in temporary housing, who are 
eligible for extra support in the form of school supplies provided by the school, as well as counseling services to 
support students while they are experiencing housing insecurity.

PROSE and increased Staff Collaboration: 

In addition to being designated a UFT Community Learning Partner School, Gotham Academy received designation as 
a PROSE school for the 2018-19 school year, in acknowledgement of the highly collaborative professional 
environment we have created at our school, as well as our participation in the New York Performance Standards 
Consortium, which promotes robust collaboration and inter-visitation among schools across the city. Robert Michelin, 
our newly appointed co-director, is working to expand and deepen the collaborative professional culture at our 
school. All staff are now engaged in collaborative inquiry in aligning curricula to mastery-based grading and offering 
multiple opportunities for students to present PBATs.  

 

Key Areas for Growth 

Based on the Focus School Recommendations for our school, aligned with the Framework for Great Schools, we are 
focusing on the following areas for improvement in the 2018-19 school year: 

Rigorous Instruction: Based on our most recent PPO, we have identified Danielson domain 1e (Designing Coherent 
Instruction) as our school-wide area of focus. We began our school year with a staff retreat that gave teacher teams 
time to collaboratively plan curriculum using tenets of the Buck Institute. We are planning a series of professional 
development activities for our staff to keep the focus on curriculum design as the first important step in building the 
rigor of our classes.  

Supportive Environment: We are partnering with Center for Supportive Schools to launch a peer mentoring program 
at Gotham Academy called Peer Group Connection. As part of this initiative all incoming 9th graders will be paired 
with an 11th or 12th grade mentor. 

Collaborative Teachers: As part of our PROSE status, we will be continuing to develop teacher capacity to engage in 
collaborative inquiry into student work and collaboratively develop original units of study that are common core 
aligned and promote higher order thinking. As a member of the Learning Partner Program (in a Triad with El Puente 
and Kurt Hahn), we are conducting collaborative inquiry into ways to increase student voice in the school community.  

Effective School Leadership: Based on very credit accumulation data from last year's school quality guide reports, we 
have identified credit accumulation as an area of focus. Using monies from our Extended School Day Grant, we have 
created our first am/pm credit-bearing courses and are allocating additional resources to provide academic supports 
for all our students to increase their credit accumulation. 

 

Strong Family-Community Ties: As a Community Learning School, we aim to increase the number of parent and 
community celebration days and therefore increase the number families attending school functions. We have found 
that these events, which highlight, showcase and celebrate the success of our students are the most effective way to 
increase parent involvement in all aspects of our school. We intend to increase the frequency of these events and use 
them as opportunities to further engage our parents and community members. 

 

 
 
 

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on our most recent school surveys, school quality snapshot, and PPO observations from the superintendent's 
team, our school's areas of strength are: 

 
  Trust  
 

Safe, supportive environment 

Strong Family/Community Ties 

Areas identified for improvement are: 

  Annual credit accumulation, especially among our youngest students 
  Rigorous instruction & curriculum design 
  Attendance 
  Effective Leadership  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
In an effort to promote more rigorous instruction and hold all students to higher standards, we are revising our school's 
curricular scope and sequence, focusing more attention on grade level academic targets, and using the new scope and 
sequence to anchor a transition to standards-based, mastery-based grading system. This new curricular system will 
result in 75% of students earning 10+ credits by June 2019.

Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
From our end-of-year data we focused on the challenge of supporting students in their transition to high school 
expectations. Too many of our incoming 9th graders are not earning enough credits to remain on track for 4-year 
graduation. We have a peer mentoring program to provide a peer mentor to all incoming students to better support 
them in their transition to high school (and support student leadership among the mentors). After our first year of 
mentoring, we see the need for more academic support.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, a new academic intervention program associated with the mastery-based grading providing students 
with time and space to meet goals so that there is an increase of 5% in course pass rates.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on our most recent school surveys, school quality snapshot, and PPO observations from the superintendent's 
team, our school's areas of strength are: 

 
  Trust  
 

Safe, supportive environment 

Strong Family/Community Ties 

Areas identified for improvement are: 

  Annual credit accumulation, especially among our youngest students 
  Rigorous instruction & curriculum design 
  Attendance 
  Effective Leadership  

Our own observations as well as feedback indicate a lack of alignment and coherence in the previous instructional 
program. As we move toward mastery-based grading, we see a greater need for coherence along with our staff's goal 
of thoroughly embedding the arts tracks within the academic courses.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

School surveys have indicated a desire on the part of teachers to be included in making decisions across the school. 
Informal conversations with staff and the PROSE office have led us to the decision to create a Steering Committee 
that connects to horizontal leadership systems within the school. The priority to be addressed is increasing the 
capacity of teacher leaders to be a strong and integral part of our school community.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, a steering committee will have been formed, set a purpose, and met once a month during the school 
year.

Based on an investigation into family attendance patterns at student progress conferences, family workshops, and 
school exhibition nights, our goal is to increase the number of Exhibition Nights/Celebration Days as a deliberate 
strategy to increase parent attendance at school events, especially family workshops designed to support college and 
career access. We found that parent, guardian, and family attendance at celebratory events like exhibition night as 
30% higher than parent/family attendance at parent-teacher conferences, and much, much higher than attendance at 
parent workshops focusing on college and career access. Our goal is to fold the workshops we want parents and 
families to attend into the celebratory events that have historically yielded much higher parent/family turnout. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

We provide counseling services to all students in temporary housing. We also reach out to families in temporary 
housing to ensure they have access to services in their community that can provide supports and assistance in 
finding permanent housing. We use STH set aside monies to purchase school supplies, backpacks, and warm 
clothing for students in temporary housing. And we ensure that all teachers are aware of students’ housing status 
so appropriate accommodations can be provided to students who may need additional time to complete 
homework assignments due to their lack of a consistent space at home to work in. 

 

Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your school 
(please note that your STH population may change over the course of the year).

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

Since opening our school in September 2007, we have been fortunate to retain many of our teachers. Four of our 
eight founding teachers are still teaching at our school. The average number of years our teachers have been teaching 
at Gotham Academy is 5, even though we have only been in existence for eight years. The main reason we credit for 
this high retention rate is our membership in the New York Performance Standards Consortium (the group of schools 
across the state that have received Regents waivers from the state and use performance assessments instead of 
Regents). As a member school in the consortium, our staff is connected to a professional community of educators 
who collaborate closely and frequently with each other around curriculum and best practices. The consortium runs 
monthly subject-based workshops that our teachers attend and take turns running. The consortium facilitates inter-
visitation days that encourage our staff to visit other schools and observe classes. The assessments required for 
graduation are designed by teachers and administered by teachers, giving them a high degree of ownership over the 
benchmarks students must meet in their subject to graduate. Combined, these elements provide our staff with 
support, resources, and connection to a community of educators engaged in similar work. 

Because membership in the New York Performance Standards Consortium has been such a vital part of our ability to 
retain high quality teachers, we recruit heavily among teachers who have worked at Consortium schools. Among our 
current staff are teachers who taught previously at a wide range of Consortium schools, including: Urban Academy, 
I.C.E., Essex Academy, Vanguard HS, Facing History HS, Fannie Lou Hammer HS. We also recruit from schools that are 
part of the Coalition of Essential Schools, nation-wide. 

Teachers are assigned to teach courses based on an annual needs-assessment we conduct into where our students 
need credits, by subject and level. Each department conducts inquiry into what students need which level of course in 
their department. And administration/guidance tallies credit needs by grade and department. Department chairs then 
meet with administration before each semester to finalize teaching assignments. Through this collaborative process, 
we ensure that teachers feel some ownership and control over what courses they teach. This element of choice is 
another crucial factor in our ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers. 

We are also initiating department-based hiring committees to join the interview process in selecting HQ candidates, in 
an effort to identify teachers who will be well-matched to the existing staff in each department.

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

As a member of the New York Performance Standards Consortium, we are fortunate to have access to monthly 
subject-based workshops that all our teachers attend or help facilitate. We also benefit from the PD, inter-visitations, 
and workshops offered by our “collaborative” partnership schools, Urban Academy and Humanities Prep. And we 
engage in professional development run by our staff for our staff. 

High-quality professional development for teachers, principals and paraprofessionals is collaborative, job-embedded, 
and differentiated. It focuses on: targeting the learning, varying formats for the learning, coaching the learning, 
sharing the learning and celebrating progress.

intervention services, etc.). 
N/A 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
As a Consortium school, our graduation level summative assessments must be based on the Regents-approved PBAT 
rubrics. Based on these rubrics, our staff engages in teacher-led collaborative cycles of designing summative and 
formative assessments, tasks and lessons. Staff engages in moderation studies at the Consortium, as well as

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Gotham Professional Arts Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
Gotham Professional Arts Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Gotham Professional Arts Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will 
share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We continue to work on a highly individualized plan with each of our few ELL students.  The very small cohort of students do 
not fit any one pattern for services.  As much as possible, we use our ESL teacher to assist gen ed teachers in providing 
supports for ELL students so that they can fully participate in our curriculum.  With the support we have been able to provide, 
all our ELL students have been able to complete our PBAT graduation requirements and pass the one required (ELA) regents 
examto questions here:    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate our success with ELL students as we would with any subgroup: through analysis of classroom data. And through 
evaluative comparisons between baseline assessment data and culminating assessment data, using the common rubrics used 
by all consortium schools in all subjects to capture student progress. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As stated before, the data set is so small it is difficult to identify patterns other than confirming that, with supports, ELL 
students are able to access our curriculum and advance appropriately to a regents diploma.  We have not had to administer 
the LAB-R in the past five years.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We employ push-in (co-teaching) and pull-out ESL support for the few students who require it.  The supports are 
designed to ensure that our ELL students are successfully accessing the curriculum in their classes    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Our one ESL teacher is able to meet the needs of our 6 ELL students through the pull-out and push-in model 
using the ESL model/ 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

                This is done on a highly individualized basis, with emphasis on the area where students are struggling based on 
classroom teacher data (Speaking/Writing/Reading/Listening).     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                All our ELL students are currently evaluated in English   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. We currently do not have any students who are SIFE.  In the past when students have missed large periods of school time, 
we work closely with families to use internet and other tools to allow the student to continue to receive and send work to the 
school. 
b. For newcomers, our emphasis is on language acquisition and developing proficiency at reading, writing, speaking and 
listening, but the goal is for them to gain the skills necessary to be full participants in our classroom culture. 
c.  Our experience with ELL students receving service between 4 and 6 years is that they are able to perform at a high level in 
all their classes with the basic ESL support and after school labs as needed. 
d.  Our experience with long-term ELLs is that they are able to meet standards with the supports available to all students in our 
school, in addition to the ESL services provided. 
e.  For former ELLs we have found that they are able to meet standards with the supports available to all students in our 
school.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We have only one ELL-SWD and have a team of teachers that propose scaffolds and supports for him to be successful and 
pursue a regents diploma.  He is performing at the high level on the NYSESLAT and benefits from organizational support but 
does not need language support.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We do not have any self-contained classes, so all our ELL-SWD are in gen-ed (least restrictive) environments.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention program is an individualized ESL support program delivered in pull-out and push-in model, with 
support labs as needed during our small group instruction time.   Each department offers small group instruction targeting 
students in need of additional support.  Our ESL students receive the same access to these support labs, but with the addition 
of the ESL teacher as necessary.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

None at this time, pending a review of data on our incoming students for next year.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None at this time, pending review of data on incoming students for next year. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

All our ELL students have full access to all our programs.  None are excluded from any courses due to less-than-proficient 
English language ability.  All our ELL students pursue and obtain a regents diploma.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We use internet and computer-assisted resources on a limited case-by-case basis, as well as computer based and stand-along 
recording devises that allow students to speak and then transcribe responses (this is technology we use with all students, as 
appropriate). 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Apart from having native speakers on staff who occasionally help our ELL students comprehend a set of complicated 
instructions or challenging assignment, but all our courses are taught in English and our ESL support is delivered in English. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

On the case-by-case basis described above. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We use internet and computer-assisted resources on a limited case-by-case basis, as well as computer based and stand-along 
recording devises that allow students to speak and then transcribe responses (this is technology we use with all students, as 
appropriate). 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We run a bridge program for all incoming students to acculturate them to our school's methods of teaching and curriculum in 
the week prior to school opening.  ELL students are identified during that bridge program and initial assessments are 
conducted among all incoming students, including ELLs.  We would follow a similar, but more individualized, in-take for new 
admits during the school year. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Paste response to question here:    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1. We will continue to rely on the excellent professional development opportunities offered by our affinity support network, 
three times a year. 
2. As a consortium school that uses performance assessments in lieu of Regents, we have always aligned our graduation tasks 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

(and the courses that lead up to them) with the Common Core Learning Standards.  We support our ELL students as we 
support all our students, through curriculum design, support labs, and immersion in a culture that promotes high standards for 
all students. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
3. We have developed a set of 9th grade expectations that we support through work with families, advisory teachers, and 
classroom teachers to ensure that students and families areaware of the change in expectations that accompany the transition 
from middle school to high school.   
  
4. We will be relying on affinity group support to provide these ELL training sessions.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
1. At all our PT conferences and any parent-involvement events (like our "Pathway to Graduation and Beyond" workshops we 
ran at the beginning of this year, we conduct outreach in parents home languages and provide translation services at those 
events to parents whose native language is not English. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Through direct interaction at registration meetings, p-t conferences, and any other parent-involvement events. we always 
conduct surveys of parent questions, needs, and solicit suggestions for workshops we could offer parents based on their 
needs. 
By increasing their participation in the educational culture of our school and pursuing the goal of parents as partners in the 
path to graduation and post-secondary education.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alexander White, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
