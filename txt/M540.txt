Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

A Philip Randolph Campus High School ( APRCHS) was founded in 1979 as an educational collaboration between the 
New York City Department of Education and the City College of New York. Since that time APRCHS has produced 
generations of successful students who have gone on to great success in college and their adult careers. A. Philip 
Randolph said that “A community is democratic only when the humblest and weakest person can enjoy the highest 
civil, economic, and social rights that the biggest and most powerful possess.”  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

The mission of A. Philip Randolph Campus High School is to provide the highest quality education to public high school 
students in order to provide them with the skills and experiences necessary to prepare them to succeed in our 
nation’s top competitive colleges and universities. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

APRCHS provides its students with the opportunity to pursue academic excellence by participating in advanced 
courses of study in our medical, engineering, and humanities academies. Students in the academies are expected to 
complete rigorous coursework in their respective fields that will better prepare them for their collegiate experiences 
in these areas. Students who distinguish themselves in their coursework have the opportunity to enroll in free college 
courses through CCNY, BMCC, and Touro Colleges, participate in special programs such as the GATEWAY pre-med 
honors society, and are given the opportunity to apply for internships. 

APRCHS offers a wide range of extra-curricular and athletic activities to broaden and engage our students outside of 
the classroom. Our after school activities range from activities such as musical and arts productions to exciting STEM 
activities such as the Randolph Environmental Conservation Organization (RECO) and the GCD Medical Internship 
Program. APRCHS offers a full range of PSAL endorsed sports such as varsity football baseball, basketball, track, 
lacrosse, soccer, swimming, volleyball, and wrestling.  
 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

APRCHS expanded our course offerings in 2016 to include the Dual Language Program. The Dual Language Program 
serves English Language Learner (ELL) students by placing them in an immersive environment in which they will be 
exposed to both Spanish and English language instruction in the following subject areas: History, English Language 
Arts, Science, and Mathematics. 

This program is equally exciting to non-ELL students as it allows students who are proficient in English and Spanish the 
opportunity to participate in the program and further develop their Spanish speaking and writing skills to include the 
ability to discourse in academic language as well as conversational speech. English proficient students were selected 
from incoming 9th graders who are identified as having advanced Spanish speaking abilities. 

The program places 17 Spanish speaking students with limited English ability in a classroom with 17 English 
speaking/Spanish proficient students. This allows both groups of students the ability to acquire new skills while being 
in a supportive environment. Another key feature of the program is the marriage of the English Language Arts (ELA) 
class and the Native Language Arts (NLA) class. The NLA class teaches the same reading and writing skills that students 
experience in the ELA class but conducts the class using Spanish language and texts. During the double period class 
both the ELL and non ELL students will be exposed to ELA and NLA aligned instruction which will best prepare all of 
the students to meet the Common Core State Standards. 

 

APRCHS served 204 students with Individualized Education Plans (IEP) during the 2017 - 2018 school year. The 
majority of IEP students are served in an Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) setting which best prepares them for Regents 
examinations and competitive college admissions. APRCHS continues to serve a small (20 students) population of New 
York State Alternative Assessment (NYSAA) students in small self contained settings. APRCHS employs 13 Special 
Education Teachers and the department is overseen by an Assistant Principal of Special Education. 

APRCHS continues to struggle to adapt to the needs of a changing school population. The overall academic strength of 
the incoming classes are becoming more varied causing the school’s instructional team to adapt teaching strategies to 
best meet the needs of an increasingly diverse student body.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

While we still have more work to do, APRCHS made the most progress in the area of Rigorous Instruction. During the 
2017 – 2018 school year APRCHS continued to expand our Instructional Focus on Literacy through our work with The 
Writing Revolution (Hochman Method). Professional Development was shifted from being external to internally 
driven. APRCHS Faculty members took an active role in meeting in instructional teams to deepen the implementation 
of the TWR initiatives in all classrooms. 

APRCHS also experienced significant growth with our mathematics department during the 2017 - 2018 school year. 
With the support of Columbia's Tutoring and Learning Center APRCHS expanded the number of students taking the 
Geometry Regents exam from 155 to 284 students and still managed to improve the passing rate from 55% to 57% in 
June 2018. 

The Teaching Faculty also expanded their leadership with professional development in 2017 - 2018. Led by the new 
Peer Collaborative Teacher (PCT) the Professional Studies Team (PST) met weekly and developed several teacher led 
presentations during the school year. This was part of an ongoing goal of addressing the issue of Collaborative 
Teachers. 

We have established the following annual goals which are aligned to the Capacity Framework: 

Rigorous Instruction: To improve teacher performance by leveraging the support of community partners to engage 
students and teachers in an action research project to improve Regents Geometry scores from 57% (SY18) to >65% 
(SY19).. 

Supportive Environment: To build on the success of the existing College Office by expanding into the new Student 
Success Center. The Student Success Center will leverage the support of community partners to ensure that at least 
90% of all students attend at least one College Readiness event by June 2019.  

Collaborative Teachers: To continue to leverage the resources of the Teacher center to improve the positive response 
rate for all questions on the 2018 - 2019 School Survey so that all responses have a +85% positive response rate on 
questions that were posed to teachers, and relate to the quality of teacher collaboration and professional 
development.  

Effective School Leadership: To improve to 85% the Agree or Strongly Agree response rate on the 2018 – 2019 NYC 
School Survey Report for any questions that were posed to teachers and pertain to Effective School Leadership where 
the response rate was less than 80% positive in 2017 - 2018. 

Strong Family and Community Ties: To improve the parent participation rate for the IO Education SKEDULA platform 
so that at least 80% of all parents have a registered login to the system by June 2019. 

Trust: Throughout all of the above goals the school will continue to prioritize the school wide capacity of trust which is

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
During the PPR Feedback provided by Superintendent Conyers, and the QR Feedback provided by the Quality Review 
Team, QR indicator 1.2 Pedagogy was identified as an area in need of attention and growth. While both 
Superintendent Conyers and the QR reviewer found evidence of improvement in this area, they both noted a lack of 
consistency of practices in the different classrooms they observed. Some classroom exhibited best practices while the 
same techniques were lacking, or poorly executed, in others. Both Superintendent Conyers and the QR reviewer also 
noted that the school showed strength in QR Indicator 1.3 Resource Allocation as the leadership team showed 
evidence of developing and managing community resources to improve services to an increasingly diverse group of 
students. 

Based on the above needs assessment it seems that APRCHS would best be served with leveraging its strength with 
leveraging community resources to improve rigorous instruction at the school. To this end APRCHS will continue to 
work with its partner, Columbia University, to support their grant funded Mathematics Lab throughout the 2018 – 
2019 school year. 

In 2017 - 2018 the Tutoring and Learning Center (TLC) reached 5 sections of Regents Geometry classes and supported 
the work of one APRCHS Faculty member, Mr. Robert White. Based upon the success of the project in 2017 - 2018 TLC 
has agreed to increase its support to include all 7 sections of Regents Geometry in 2018 - 2019 which will include the 
classrooms of three Math teachers, Mr. Robert White, Ms. Noelia Cespedes, and Mr. Terrence Bullock. 

 

Goals for the Math Lab: 

1) Focus on improving the Math area most in need of improvement, Geometry and Increase the Regents pass rate 

from 57% in 2018 to 65% in 2019. 

2) Provide WIFI access and laptops to all participating student’s homes to allow access to the software for homework. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

During the 2016 – 2017 School year the Administrative Team partnered with the UFT Chapter Consultative Committee 
to revisit and revise the teacher team and professional development protocols in order to respond to teacher 
feedback. Teachers had expressed concerns that professional development at the school was not differentiated to 
their needs and did not always have enough follow through to help them develop stronger skills. 

The project experienced early success with the UFT Chapter Consultative Committee meeting with teachers and 
revising the teacher team protocols and facilitating a collaborative decision on the initial professional development 
topics. Unfortunately the project began to lose steam as the year progressed as committee members had increasingly 
less time to devote to planning as their other professional responsibilities took precedent during the year. 

Based on the experiences from the 2016 – 2017 school year, and the feedback from the PPO visits and Quality Review 
which suggested the need for more teacher training, it has been decided that the school open up a Teacher Center 
with dedicated teaching staff members who will work with the administrative team to facilitate professional learning 
at A. Philip Randolph Campus High School during the 2017 – 2018 school year. 

During the 2017 - 2018 school year APRCHS staffed an existing Faculty member as a Peer Collaborative Teacher (PCT). 
The PCT was charged with establishing a Professional Studies Team (PST) and to hold weekly meetings to plan and 
facilitate Faculty led professional development throughout the school year. The PST held Faculty led professional 
development meetings during all of the Chancellor's PD days in 2017 - 2018 and during select Monday PD sessions. 
Teacher feedback on these events were largely positive and the weekly PST meetings were well attended. 

In consultation with the School Leadership Team (SLT) and the Administrative Cabinet it was decided that the Teacher 
Center, and PCT role, be continued into the 2018 - 2019 school year. The role of the Teacher Center would continue to 
support the PST but would expand to include a greater focus on mentoring new teachers to the NYCDOE and to the 
APRCHS community. 

 

Goals for the Teacher Center 

1) To improve the positive response rate for all questions on the 2018 - 2019 School Survey so that all responses have 
a +85% positive response rate on questions that were posed to teachers, and relate to the quality of teacher 
collaboration and professional development.  

2) To ensure that all new teachers are matched with a mentor and that all new teachers meet their mentoring 
requirements by June 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017 – 2018 NYC School Survey reported that the APRCHS community expressed a 87% satisfaction level in the 
area of Effective School Leadership. While the positive response level is good and reflective of 93% (83) of the 
teachers taking the survey, there is certainly room for improvement in certain areas. 

 

As a result the SLT and the Administrative Cabinet have targeted the following prompts with a low (<80%) positive 
response rate in the area of Effective School Leadership: 

 

75% of teachers reported that the principal participates in instructional planning with teams of teachers. (Q11h) 

77% of teachers reported that they have influence over the selection of instructional materials used in classrooms 
(Q12c) 

Based on the sample data above the Administrative Team and SLT of APRCHS propose the following 

GOALS FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM: 

  Collaborate with the PST and Departmental Assistant Principals to create at least one department meeting 

per year in which the Principal participates in instructional planning with each department. 

  Engage the Professional Studies Team (PST) to develop a mechanism to establish teacher voice regarding 

instructional materials 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
To improve to 85% the Agree or Strongly Agree response rate on the 2018 – 2019 NYC School Survey Report for any 
questions that were posed to teachers and pertain to Effective School Leadership where the response rate was less 
than 80% positive in 2017 - 2018.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Administrative Cabinet and School Leadership Team reviewed the 2016 - 2017 School Quality Snapshot. They 
identified the area of Strong Family Community Ties as being an area in need of growth. Specifically they identified 
the concern that only 77% of families said that school officials regularly communicated with them. As a result the SLT 
has recommended that we revisit our use of the Pupilpath student database as a means of outreaching busy parents 
and attempt to improve our communication protocols. 

A. Philip Randolph Campus High School has been using the IO Education (SKEDULA) student database for electronic 
grade books and parent communication since September 2013. This system has proven to be and effective means of 
communication for students, parents, and Faculty over the last several years. However inconsistencies with staffing of 
the Parent Coordinator office have led to a decline in participation for parents which has reduced critical elements of 
the efficacy of the system. 

 

In consultation with the School Leadership Team (SLT) and Administrative Cabinet the following goals have been 
established for the SKEDULA system 

SKEDULA GOALS:  

To improve the parent participation rate for the IO Education SKEDULA platform so that at least 80% of all parents 
have a registered login to the system by June 2019. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. A. Philip Randolph Campus High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

A. Philip Randolph Campus High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Describe the direct instruction supplemental program here and include the 

rationale 

 
  subgroups and grade levels of students to be served  
  schedule and duration 
 
language of instruction 
  # and types of certified teachers 
 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
 
The rationale for this plan is as follows:  To improve the performance of literacy and writing 
skills of our ELL students a reading and writing supplemental program will occur on Wednesday 
and Thursday, after school. Beginning on December 10th and ending on June 7th from 2:30 PM- 
4:30 P.M.  Our program will also provide the additional support to assist ENL students with 
Academic English through core content in English and Social Studies classes.  This plan will be 
provided in English and will contain various literacy training programs to provide students with 
ENL services and approach grade level literacy.  The focus of our Direct Instruction 
Supplemental Program will be identifying, acquiring and upgrading instructional materials for 
English and Social Studies classes.  The providers for this service will be a Dual Language 
content teacher, a Social Studies teacher and a certified ESL teacher.  Students will be grouped 
based on ENL Proficiency levels (flexible groupings). Dictionaries and computer translators will 
be provided for all a students. Sessions are opened to all ENL students who obtained a 55 
average or lower in their English and Social studies classes. Students have been chosen 
according to DATA collected from STARS and Social Studies and English teacher 
recommendation from grades 9-11 and the EDAT. The materials that will be used are: The 
Hochman Method (The Writing Revolution), Achieve 3000 and from Hampton-Brown Edge: 
Reading, Writing, & Language (level A for Entering and Emerging ELLS, Level B for 
Transitioning ELLS, and Level C for Expanding ELLS). The student will engage in 
differentiated literacy projects, comprehension and literary analysis, grammar, vocabulary 
acquisition and writing.  
Methodology:  Two classes; one content teacher and Integrated ENL. 
Two classes will be created according to students' levels which will allow teachers to facilitate 
and monitor student work simultaneously as they work on a designated skill or topic (English or 
Social Studies related). At the same time, selected students can receive instruction targeting their 
unique needs by the ENL teacher. Learning centers, learning stations, and guided reading groups 
also will be incorporated. One hour will be dedicated to ELA instruction and one hour will be 
dedicated to Social Studies Instruction; the ENL teacher will be collaborating with both classes. 
 
Literacy Project/Analysis Activities: 
- Research on Building the Pyramids of Egypt: Students learn how historians think the pyramids 
were built and why they were built—as doorways to the afterlife for the pharaohs. Students 
develop their literacy skills as they explore a social studies focus on ancient Egyptian society and 
how those at the top organized the rest of the population in order to build these amazing 
structures. During this process, they read informational text, learn and practice vocabulary 
words, and explore content through videos and interactive activities. 
- Writings of the Ancient Maya: Students are introduced to the ancient Mayan civilization 
through their writings. Students develop their literacy skills as they explore a social studies focus 
on the destruction of many Mayan writings by the Spanish and what archaeologists have learned 
from the writings that remain. During this process, they read informational text, learn and 
practice vocabulary words, and explore content through a video and interactive activities.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
- Character Conflict: Language Immersion: Students watch videos that tell the story of Moises, a 
fictional Spanish-speaking young immigrant who faces conflicts in his English-immersion school 
in the United States. Students develop their literacy skills as they explore an English language 
arts focus on internal and external conflict as a plot device. During this process, they read 
informational text, learn and practice vocabulary words, and explore content through videos and 
interactive activities. 
- High school ELL Shared Journey workshop at the Tenement museum: 
Workshop: Sweatshop workers.  Features the apartments of the Levines, a Jewish family running 
a garment shop from their home in the 1890s, and the Rogarshevskys, a Jewish family of eight 
with working teenagers in the 1910s. In the workshop, students tour the museum’s historic 
tenement building, learn new English vocabulary words, and participate in discussion activities 
about how their own immigrant experiences compare to those of immigrants past.  
Dates: 03/11/2019, 03/12/2019, 03/13/2019, 03/14/2019. Maximum group size is 15 people.

Begin description here:            
Research has shown a direct correlation of student improvement when parents are more involved 
in their children's education. There will be 2 - 3 sessions where parents will be invited to speak 
with our bilingual College Counselor to answer any questions they may have.  Session will be 
approximately 90 minutes in length.  Parents will be invited to college workshop presentations 
and information sessions. Topics will include the importance of a college education as well as 
ways to finance college for immigrant students.  Parents will be notified via phone blasts and 
emails of these special nights.  Such events will begin in mid - March 2019 and end in early June 
2019.  Parents will be notified for the events via phone call and email blasts by the college 
counselor. In addition, this year parent engagement activities will include efforts to recruit 
parents of ENL students to serve with staff on various committees such as the School Leadership 
Team, and the PTA so that parents will have greater involvement in the school community as a 
whole.  Data has shown that ENL student attendance rates have dropped since last year. In order 
to educate parents on the importance of Attendance for our ENL community, we are providing 
different Parent workshops that focus on Attendance. We will begin our Attendance initiative 
and our first session will take place on October 25th, 2018 from 4:00 PM -5:00 PM. The second 
session will be provided on December 13th, 2018 from 1:30 PM- 2:30 PM. The third session will 
be provided on January 31st 2019 from 4:00PM- 5:00 PM. All sessions of the Attendance 
initiative will be provided by our ENL teacher and translation services will be provided as 
needed. The teacher will have a binder with all the agendas, attendance sheets and invitations. 
During the sessions we are encouraging families to attend the workshop provided by the PTA on 
November 7th and 20th, December 11th2018.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
As our students are all in high school, we use the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to measure their literacy skills. We share the 
results with the faculty so that they can use it to plan lessons that support all students. Our teachers use the EDAT data to 
monitor overall student progress and to customize learning. The data is used to place students in small learning groups where 
they can develop and/or improve their language skills. This Data is also used in curriculum development; the assigned ENL 
teacher identifies the learning objective in which the student didn't perform well and address the gaps in students' knowledge 
and skills. Also, the teachers modify the topics and rigor of the lessons.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

We use a DATA team to examine individual student work generated from common formative assessments and DATA from 
Achieve 3000 and the Reading Plus program. The collaborative meetings take place every Tuesday after school. Teachers 
follow a protocol for analyzing the strengths and obstacles that each ELL student is facing.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs by looking at the NYSESLAT results, the Regents results and the course grades of our 
ELLs.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We use a DATA team to analyze the Data from the NYSESLAT. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data analyzed from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT demonstrate that all our ELLS are having difficulty with the writing portion 
of the exams. However, we have seen patterns of improvement in the following modalities: listening, reading and speaking. A 
high percentage of our 9th  graders (39%) and 10th graders (11%) scored low in the writing modality. We are targetting our 
incoming 9th graders because we have analyzed their scores in the ELA exams  and noticed that they are scoring between 1 
and 2 which shows that they need extra support in their English classes. Therefore our 9th grade English teachers are receiving 
push-in support services from the ENL teacher.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The DATA team uses the Data Wise Improvement Process. We follow of eight steps designed to enhance the ability of teachers 
to collaboratively analyze data in order to achieve improved classroom instruction and student learning. These steps are 
organized in three phases: Prepare, Inquire, and Act. We prepare a meeting for collaborative work and build assessment 
literacy. After we do inquiry; create data overview, look at student data and examine instruction. Afterwards, we develop an 
action plan and then assess the progress.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELLs is delivered based on the English proficiency levels using the NYSESLAT. The NYSESLAT determines 
the students proficiency according to CR Part 154 requirements at 5 different levels. According to CR Part 154 
students with an Entering proficiency level are receiving 180 minutes a day in Stand- alone ENL instruction with the 
ENL teacher. On the other hand, students in the Emerging proficiency level are receiving 90 minutes a day in Stand- 
alone ENL instruction with another ENL teacher. Students in the transitioning, expanding and commanding levels are 
receiving integrated ENL instruction through their English content area with their English teacher and the certified ENL 
teacher. All students are grouped regardless of their grade in one class and have mixed proficiency levels. Our ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

teachers differentiate instruction by using the SIOP model.     
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We offer a 50/50 ‘two-way’ dual language program. 50% of the day is spent studying in Spanish and 50% in English, 
and the language learning is going two ways: Spanish speakers are learning English and their subject areas, and 
English speakers are learning Spanish and their subject areas. Students are placed in an immersive environment in 
which they are exposed to both Spanish and English language instruction in the following subject areas: History, 
English Language Arts, Science, and Mathematics. We have 66 students in our Dual language program that are 
grouped heterogeneously. Students follow a block schedule and travel together as a group.    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels in each 
program model (ENL) as mandated that  students in the entering and emerging level receive 360 minutes a week, students in 
the transitioning and expanding level receive 180 minutes a week and students on the commanding level receive .5 unit of 
study per week. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our school's instructional focus, the entire school community is focusing on literacy across all disciplines to reflect and refine 
practices in order to strengthen the integration of initiatives to prepare all English Language learners to graduate and become 
college and career ready. Students in our ENL and Dual Language program are analyzing text and utilizing a common 
vocabulary throughout the curriculum in all subject areas. Students are annotating and decoding complex texts through 
various scaffolding techniques that foster language development. Our ENL teachers and Dual Language teachers are using the 
SIOP model. All ELL students attend classes with non-ELL students. Students work in cooperative groups, pairs, and 
independently. Teachers use technology to help students visualize concepts. Teaching methodologies used in both the SIOP 
class and in the other classes include visuals, videos, maps, graphic organizers, and higher order thinking questions. A key 
feature of the Dual language program is the marriage of the English Language Arts (ELA) class and the Native Language Arts 
(NLA) class. The NLA class teaches the same reading and writing skills that students experience in the ELA class but conducts 
the class using Spanish language and texts. During the double period class both the ELL and non-ELL students will be exposed 
to ELA and NLA aligned instruction which will best prepare all of the students to meet the Common Core State Standards. In 
addition the instruction in Algebra, Living Environment and Global studies are given one day in English and one day in Spanish. 
In both programs we are using iLIT, glossaries, dictionaries and materials in their native language to enhance their literacy 
skills.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The NYSITELL is used to assess native language proficiency. As well, students are interviewed in their native language, provided 
there is personnel capable of doing so in the students native language. All ELL's are given a choice to take the State regents in 
their native language. Our Dual language students regularly take teacher created assessments in their native language since 
instruction is given in two languages. At the beginning of the semester students took a diagnostic assessment created by the 
Dual language teacher, Ms. Martinez that evaluated their writing, reading, grammar, listening and speaking skills.   
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

A. To enrich language development of all ELLs a set of instructional practice has been set in place. One of them is through 
differentiated instructon in English.  Also, ELLs are provided with glossaries of the most commonly used words in the content 
areas. Entering students are partnered with students that are Expanding in terms of language skills and performance.  The ENL 
teacher provides support by teaching lessons that build academic and language skills in content areas such as math, science, 
social studies and language arts.B. Instruction for newcomer students is differentiated by providing students with 
accommodations in the classroom.  Entering students are partnered with Emerging, transitioning or Expanding students. 
Instruction is supported with visuals. Clear expectations are part of every lesson as well as comprehensive in-put.  Objectives 
are aligned with the Common Core State Standards. ENL lessons are carefully planned to support learning in other content 
areas (vocabulary and content as well).C. Students receiving service for four to six years would normally be able to perform, at 
least, at an transitioning level.  Their instructional plans will focus on developing confidence. Students are expected to respond 
to questions that require HOTS (higher thinking skills), in academic (classroom related/content areas) and social 
situations.  Instrucional plans and goals must be aligned with the Common Core State Standards and the New York State 
Standards.D. Students receiving service for six years or longer are ususally in the expanding or commanding category.  Their 
instruction will be scaffolded and differentiated,requiring evidence of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) in all language 
modalities (Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing).  Expanding and Commanding students are asked to show a deep level of 
understanding and performance in every academic course.E. Former ELLs are fully integrated into a regular curricular program, 
which continues to provide differentiation and scaffolding to meet their academic needs. Students may continue to be eligible 
for ELL testing accommodations and 90 minutes per week of ENL for two additional years. All ELLs are entitled to: time 
extension on all exams (time and a half) and may use bilingual glossaries and dictionaries when taking State assessments and 
on Regents exams.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our instructional plans for ELLs identified as having special needs is created in collaboration with their content area teachers 
(teacher conferences) and related service provider.  This way teachers ensure that their students Individualized Educational 
Plan (IEP) is fullfilled and his/her goals and objectives are being met.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students are placed in a least restrictive environment possible, after receiving input from the IEP team and SBST (School Based 
Support Team) to ensure our students are being placed with the most likelihood of success. Teachers are also provided with 
the most relevant and up to date professional development opportunities to support these dually mandated students.  Finally, 
much care and consideration is given to make sure students are flexibility programmed based on their strengths and 
weaknesses.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The ENL teacher provides support in all content areas: Science, Social Studies and Math by planning lessons that build 
academic language.  This way students build on content vocabulary that support content areas. Strengthening classroom 
instruction (i.e., the instructional core), is a key step to supporting ELLs at-risk or experiencing difficulties. At our school we 
implement target interventions for ELLs through the guidance counselor and with the student's teachers. If the student scores 
below specified level of performance on the State assessments then the school determines if the student requires additional 
support services. The evidence evaluated in order to provide additional support services to the student is the following: 
number of years of instruction in ENL program, English and home language literacy, content area and socio-emotional support 
needs for SIFE, ENL teacher recommendation, content area teacher recommendation and parent of guardian request. When 
students are struggling we devise a plan for intervention that includes the instructional strategies and the results, the levels of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

instructions, delivery of instruction, difficulties or struggles, family involvement and motivation. We encourage our students 
and teachers to develop strategies to support competencies in the four modalities (reading, listening, speaking and writing), 
teachers also design lessons and activities that connects to students identities and languages, and also include cultural and 
high quality literacy instruction.  Teachers take the following steps to ensure students are progressing in language acquisiton: 
always examining achievement in the classroom, drawing on multiple sources of information, analyzing data through a 
language acquisition lens, designing and implementing targeted supplemental supports, monitoring progress over time and 
planning for mid-course corrections. If the student keeps struggling after intervention and after high quality instructional 
support provided over an adequate period of time then the Special Education Assistant Principal analyzes the case in order to 
conduct a comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation to determine if a student requires special education services.       
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Currently, we have a Dual Language program that our ELL's benefit from an integrated program that encourages them to 
participate and interact with native speakers of English while engaged in their daily routines. We also have both of our ENL 
teachers pushing into our English and Global Studies classes. We are also increasing the number of ENL related workshops 
offered to the content area teachers. In addition, we are providing our Entering and Emerging ELLs an after school enrichment 
program in all academic areas.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Students have equal access to all school programs. Students have access to academic intervention services in all subject 
areas.  Posters are placed throughout the school to encourage students to join clubs and programs offered at A.P. Randolph 
Campus H.S. In addition, the bilingual COSA (Coordinator of Student Activities) and the bilingual Parent Coordinator, along with 
local CBOs (Community-Based Organizations) offer after-school activities that supplement academic learning and cultural 
enrichment opportunities. Some extracurricular activities that students can join are: National Honor Society, National Society 
for Black Engineers (NSBE), College for Every Student (CFES), College and Career Preparatory Institute (CCPI), Gateway to 
Medicine, Debate Team, Peer Mediation Program and Student Government. Also students can join  PSAL Sports Teams like: 
Baseball & JV Baseball, Basketball & JV Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Indoor Track, Lacrosse, Outdoor Track, Soccer, 
Swimming, Volleyball and tennis. Students have the opportunity to take advanced placement courses throughout their school 
career such as: Biology, Calculus AB, Computer Science A, English Language and Composition, English Literature and 
Composition, Macroeconomics, Physics B, Psychology, Spanish Language and Culture, Spanish Literature and Culture, United 
States History and World History.  In addition, we offer our ELLs tutoring every Tuesday after school. Also the Gateway 
program provides daily peer tutoring in all subject areas during every lunch period.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Some of the instructional materials, including technology, used to support ELLs are the posters, computers, and projectors in 
all content areas and are available to all our the students. We have some content area books in Spanish, that students can 
reference. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In addition to glossaries, dictionaries, and materials in the native languages teacher provide support to students by grouping 
them with students that can assist them in their home language. In the Dual Language and in the ENL program students are 
provided with computers and translated readings that they can utilize during their lunch period with the Dual Language 
coordinator. The Dual Language coordinator provides, both groups (ENL and Dual Language Students), with support in Spanish 
and English for students who may be struggling with content and concepts in their subject-area classes. According to current 
research, students who have built strong foundations in their native language will be able to transfer their language skills to 
the second or third language. Students who speak Spanish or French can take native language classes to support their culture 
and language acquisition at a higher level. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Students are programmed into grade level classes regardless of their English level. Therefore curriculum in content classes is 
age appropriate. They go to ENL to supplement their content learning.  In addition, our library, provides our students with 
authentic books and resources in several languages that appeal to a variety of age groups and language levels.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We conduct a series of orientation workshops during the months of May and June for the incoming 9th graders, where 
simultaneous translation services in Spanish are provided. Current students are important participants in these orientations 
because they help introduce new students to the layout of the school, the school curriculum, and some important adults in the 
building. Incoming 9th graders are able to connect to our student leaders, who can provide them with assistance in the coming 
years. When new ELLs arrive throughout the year, we provide a personalized orientation and we pair them with a student 
leader who speaks the same native language and is willing to help them.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At A.P. Randolph, we offer Spanish and French, as Foreign Languages. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. We use a 50-50 immersion model. Students receive instruction in a Dual language class (ELA and 
Spanish) everyday.  Students receive their content classes, Living Environment, Algebra and Global 
Studies alternating the target language, one day of instruction is in Spanish and the other day is in 
English. 
b. Student receive all their content classes in both languages. Students receive their elective class and 
physical education in English. 
c. In the Dual language class the language is separate by time, 44 minutes in English and 44 minutes in 
Spanish. In Algebra, Science and Global Studies one day instruction will be in English and another day 
instruction will be in Spanish. 
d. All classes use a technique call preview-view-review in which the languages are mixed. For example if 
the content teacher is teaching in Spanish all day, the preview will ask students to use English to respond 
to the task, then the teacher introduces the activities and focus of the class in Spanish and lastly in the 
review students can assess their English skills for assessment of the lesson.  Literacy is taught in both 
languages in a sequential order.

Ms. Martinez and other experienced instructors provide PDs, workshops, and trainings that provide strategies that 
promote  learning through the use of differentiated instruction and scaffolding. Professional Developments are designed to 
guide teachers in understanding and implementing the Common Core. The PDs address: Knowledge of the shifts, setting a 
vision for college-and career-readiness, developing clear metrics to guide student work and staying engaged in the work. 
Teachers reflect on their practices and also share best practices.  
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel and the Assistant Principal of ENL/Dual language work together in order to service all 
our ELLs and to ensure that all students are receiving the adequate time allocations according to the NYSESLAT scores. The 
Assistant Principal of PPS provides school counselors with a Professional Development on Programming, credit accumulation 
and college and career readiness for ELLs.   
  
All teaching staff require professional development of ELL training. All teachers will be provided with professional development 
in language acquisition focusing on best practices and co-teaching strategies and using language in content instruction for all 
ELLs. All of our ENL teachers are required to explore language acquisition in alignment with Common Core Standards and core 
content area instruction (all teaching staff require 15% and 50% for ENL teachers of the required professional development 
hours). The following are focus topics for professional development and co-teaching strategies: 
        1.  Assessments, Evaluation and Placement of ELL students. 
        2.  Implementation of Instructional ENL throughout the curriculum. 
        3.  Making Content Clear for ELL students-lesson planning. 
        4.  Scaffolding the reading of difficult text. 
        5.  Scaffolding instruction for English Language Learners 
        6.  Differentiating instruction for the development of literacy. 
        7.  The development of speaking skills.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We meet with parents (individually) at least once a year to discuss their child’s language development progress, the English 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. In this additional meeting, 
teachers, guidance counselor and the Assistant Principal inform parents about the language development in all content areas 
in English and for Dual Language students in English and Spanish. The meeting is conducted with a qualified 
interpreter/translator in the parents preferred language. We record attendance and we document the information on Skedula 
and ATS ILOG.             

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The parent coordinator provides workshops on different topics concerning school policies, Pupilpath, college requirements, 
After school programs and ELL support programs for students and families. All materials are translated into the parents 
preferred language. The parent coordinator contact the services of a translator if needed. Some of the parental activities that 
A. Philip Randolph offers parents: Follow Us to Success to provide a workshop on the College Process. The entire workshop is 
translated into Spanish including the presentation from Follow Us to Success.  Our parents are educated about the needs of 
their child and express that we provide them services that are readily accepted. For example we curtail our workshops so they 
are scheduled in a time period where they are relevant. A homework help workshop will be conducted in this month as 
parents may need extra support to get their children to do homework.  
   
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Answer to parental involvement question #2: Parent coordinator maintains records and sign in sheets for individual parent 
meetings. The school counselor and teachers use ILOG and skedula to document parental outreach. Also the Assistant Principal 
records the meetings and ensures that the record is kept in the student's file.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Fanning, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the home language survey and the related data on STARS and ATS to determine our translation and 
interpretation needs. As described in our LAP some of those languages are: Arabic, Bengali, French and Spanish.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

English speakers, many 
of their parents are not. 
Based on the RPOB 
report from ATS, 663 of 
our families speak 
Spanish at home. 
Therefore, we provide 
translation services in 
Spanish.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services
