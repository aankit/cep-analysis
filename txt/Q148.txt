Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to be a community school that exemplifies the best in teaching practices which in turn will empower all 
students to become strong, educated, well-rounded contributing members of society. For this reason, in addition to 
the core curriculum, we offer our students classes in art, music, theater, as well as infusing technology opportunities 
in all of our classrooms. We are committed to working collaboratively with parents, families and educators to help 
build a community of lifelong learners.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P. S. 148 is a dynamic learning environment situated in East Elmhurst, Queens, serving a population of approximately 
810 students in grades pre-kindergarten through five. Our students come from extremely diverse cultural, ethnic and 
linguistic backgrounds making our school a rich and vibrant environment.  

 

In addition to our core curriculum, we offer our students classes in visual art, music (including Music and the Brain 
keyboard training for grades Kindergarten and one), drumming, choir, chess and technology. We offer Transitional 
Bilingual classes in grades Kindergarten through 3. Each class in grades Kindergarten through five showcases their 
unique talents in a class performance each year. We are also excited to be a part of the Computer Science for All 
Initiative (For example, scratch, coding, robotics, etc.). Students are exposed to a variety of arts opportunities 
including Studio in a School, Ballet Tech, New York City Ballet Nutcracker Project, Jazz at Lincoln Center and Salsa 
Dancing. We offer Cookshop® classes to our kindergarten through grade five classes. Operation Explore (a two night, 
three day camping expedition for our fifth grade students) and dance festival for grades pre-kindergarten through 
second. Our students stay active in our after-school tennis program and our physical education offerings, which now 
include Lacrosse. Our fourth and fifth grade students are eligible to participate in our debate team and compete in 
city-wide competitions open to elementary schools. Our school boasts a state of the art library open daily to all 
classes. 

Our NYJTL after-school program offers students the opportunity to stay active through tennis and dance. A number of 
the students participate in tennis tournaments in the fall, spring and summer. The children are engaged in theatre 
arts activities, chess, STEM, crochet and creative writing. 

 

Parents are valued partners of our school community. The Parent Teacher Association holds monthly meetings 
alternating mornings and evenings which are always well attended. At these meetings, a student from each class is 
awarded a Student of the Month Certificate based on citizenship or academics. The parent leaders in our building are 
active and dedicated through their sponsorship of many events and activities for our children. Some of these include 
movie nights, fund-raising, supplementing class trips, purchasing materials needed for the physical education 
department, purchasing materials for special programs as well as classroom teachers. They are always willing to offer 
assistance when they see a need. For example, when our School Safety Officer was in need of a new chair, the PTA 
purchased the chair. They have also provided financial assistance to families who have suffered a loss, such as two 
families last year who were displaced due to fire. Parents are visible in our school on a daily basis through their 
volunteer efforts in the classroom as well as chaperoning field trips. The PTA offers activities such as Zumba classes 
which are held weekly. They work in conjunction with the administration to acquire necessary permits when our 
school has special events. Through their work with the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, planting days are held 
semi-annually to enhance the grounds of our school and promote our inviting atmosphere. Additionally, our Title 1 
Parent Committee organizes a series of workshops to support current needs of the parents. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

English as a New Language Learners (ENLs), represent one third of our student population (32.4%). Our ENLs range 
from newcomers to students who are deemed commanding in English language acquisition. Their needs therefore 
vary and we offer supports in the content areas through our focus on questioning and discussion and assessment.  

 

In order to assist our parents in helping their children, we offer adult ENL-English as a New Language in the evenings 
and make sure that personnel are available to conduct meetings in both English and Spanish.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

Our students with disabilities (SWDs) comprises 15% of the school population. Our school works to facilitate 
achievement of Next Generation Standards for our SWDs with the same educational goals as those of our general 
education population. We use students' Individualized Education Programs to ensure individualization of approaches.  

 

Teachers are analyzing student data and work products in order to reflect on the level of rigor of content and skills 
taught. At this stage of curricula and task planning, teachers throughout the school are building learning plans into 
units of study that emphasize content skills and areas of focus, such as embedding deeper problem solving strategies 
and infusing vocabulary. Culminating academic tasks address these focus areas in order to make accurate adjustments 
to curriculum based on student outcomes so that all students have access to the curriculum. Instruction reflects the 
instructional shifts in literacy and math and teachers are making modifications to surface the critical thinking 
capacities of English language learners and students with disabilities. This allows for opportunities for students with 
disabilities and English language learners to learn at high levels to maximize academic achievement. 

 

In most classrooms, all learners are speaking in front of peers and are participating fully. Teachers provide sufficient 
supports in the form of charts or sentence frames to meet students at their entry points. As a result, all students are 
able to fully engage in the learning taking place and produce as meaningful work products. When presented with 
challenging tasks, students are asked to explain how they arrived at their responses. Students work collaboratively in 
strategically organized groups and partnerships and are able to critique one another and support their claims with 
evidence.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school has engaged in the work of the Framework for Great Schools through our focus on the collaborative 
teachers' element. Our highly qualified staff members participate in professional development for our curricular 
resources - ReadyGen, GoMath and Fundations, lab-sites at our school, and attendance at workshops throughout the 
year. Staff members also participate in inquiry teams led by their colleagues. In these teams, teachers and para-
professionals work together to deepen their repertoire of teaching practices. Teachers also participate in workshops 
on Advanced Literacy, Passport for Social Studies, CUNY Creative Arts, Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Strategies 
(TCIS), Conceptual understanding in mathematics and several others for professional growth and learning. These are 
the hallmarks of Rigorous Instruction and Collaborative Teachers.  

Parents are a vital part of our school community. We continue to develop strong family-community ties - an element 
of the Framework for Great Schools. We plan workshops during the day and in the evening to help deepen our 
parents’ understanding of the curriculum so that they may have the tools necessary to help their children. Teachers 
meet with parents on a one-to-one basis to assist parents in understanding their child’s goals and offer individualized 
strategies to help meet their goals. We offer our families monthly cooking classes as well as Zumba. Strengthening the 
home-school connection is paramount.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
A review of end of year ELA i-Ready data (June 2018) reveals the following: 

 

Students across grades K-5 were assessed in six (6) components of reading: 

 
  Average of students below level in each strand across grades 

o  Phonological Awareness: 26% 
o  Phonics: 47% 
o  High-Frequency Words: 24%  
o  Vocabulary: 74% 
o  Comprehension (Literature): 65% 
o  Comprehension (Informational Text): 66% 

A review of end of year math i-Ready data reveals the following: 

 

 

Students across grades K-5 were assessed in four (4) mathematical strands 

 
  Average of students below level in each strand across grades 

o  Number and Operations: 49% 
o  Algebra and Algebraic Thinking: 51% 
o  Measurement and Data: 64% 
o  Geometry: 68% 

Priority focus will be on improving access to academic vocabulary in order to increase success across content areas as 
deficiencies in vocabulary are preventing students from comprehending both literary and informational text. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
In order to improve outcomes across grades levels we will provide students we will embed vocabulary instruction in all 
content areas so that by June 2019 there will be a minimum 5% decrease in the percentage of students performing 
below level in the Vocabulary and Comprehension components as measured by the i-Ready Diagnostic and Instruction 
system.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
A review of teacher reported incidents regarding student behavior reveals the following: The majority of incidents 
occur during transitions to and from the bathroom as well as to and from clusters programs.  
 
A review of student-related incidents reported in the Online Occurrence Reporting System (OORS) reveals the 
following: 
 
The majority of the incidents occurred during or right after arrival and during or right after lunch periods.  
 
As a result, our priority focus is a reduction in the number of teacher reported incidents for students with repeated 
occurrences of challenging behavior. 
 
PS 148 Q will continue with the PBIS program for behavior intervention.  
 
PS 148 will begin the Cloud 9 Character development program.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
In order to support students in their academic and social growth and promote positive school climate and culture we 
will establish and implement integrated safety, discipline and intervention policies and procedures so that by June 
2019 there will be a 10% reduction in the number of teacher-reported behavior incidents as measured by data in the 
School-Wide Information System (SWIS).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to Advance, the average end of year rating in components 1a: Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and 
Pedagogy, 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction, and 3c: Engaging Students in Learning is as follows: 
 

  1a: 3.05 (effective) 
  1e: 3.02 (effective) 
  3c: 2.93 (effective) 

 
However, there is a disconnect between the observed instruction and the number of students in grades 3-5 who did 
not meet promotional criteria in English Language Arts and Mathematics. This data also aligns with the i-Ready results 
and leads us to hypothesize that access to vocabulary is the key to reducing these numbers.

Our priority focus is to strengthen vocabulary instruction across content areas and increase the range of pedagogical 
skills of teachers so that student achievement improves in both ELA and math. 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
In order to ensure improvement in academic vocabulary instruction we will target a minimum of two (2) observation 
cycles to content area instruction so that by June 2019 there will be a minimum average of 3.5 in components 1a, 1e 
and 3c of the Danielson Framework for Teaching as measured by the Advance Teacher Development and Evaluation 
System.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Although the school scored above the district and citywide averages for Parent Involvement in School, the prompt – 
“families say that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school” – only 54% of parents 
responded “Sometimes” or “Often”.  
 
Our priority focus is to increase the number of parents who volunteer in the classrooms and at schoolwide events.

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
In order to collaborate with families as full partners in the learning and development of their children we will improve 
communication regarding volunteer opportunities so that by June 2019 there will be a minimum 10% increase in the

We have aligned our curriculum to coincide with the instructional shifts of the Common Core Standards that grades K-
5 are engaged in. We are in the process of closing curriculum gaps in order to address the five pillars of reading. Units 
of study implemented in Pre-K are Common Core aligned. There is vertical professional development and articulation 
between Pre-K and Kindergarten teachers. Throughout the year, Pre-K parents will be involved in workshops to 
inform them of the new Common Core Learning Standards and how they can support their children in meeting the 
standards. Pre-kindergarten teachers will hold two workshops during the year on Parent Engagement Tuesday. "Sneak 
Peek" for parents of pre-kindergarten students will be held prior to the start of the upcoming school term.

multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
A Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) committee is convened annually. In September a decision is made as to State 
and Local Measures for Advance. During grade conferences with administration and instructional coach, there is 
ongoing professional development on the use of formative and summative assessments triangulated with the MOSL 
choices. The Instructional Cabinet and grade leaders discusses the selection of formative assessments and 
benchmarks. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

PS 148 is creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the home school connection in 
support of student achievement. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them 
in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively 
participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Teacher Association, and Title I Parent Committee and are 
welcomed members of the school community.  

 

PS148 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESEA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
School day teachers work with the Lead CBO to implement academic support programming after school that aligns 
with school day instruction. Students enrolled in programming have been given 4 hours per week of additional 
academic instruction time. The Community School Director collaborates with the AP to ensure the instruction aligns 
with the school curriculum and is high quality. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By January 2019, 6 school day teachers will provide 4 hours per week of academic enrichment to students during after 
school that aligns with the school curriculum. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
The Community School Director will work with the school administration to plan and implement ELT programming, 
attendance support, family engagement activities, and mental health interventions. The ELT programming specifically 
focuses on academic enrichment in ELA and Math with the goal of improving student test scores.  

The Mental Health Counselor employed by CCNY works with students, individually and in groups, to support social-
emotional and mental health needs. Supporting student's mental health will break down any barriers they are facing 
to performing to the best of their ability in the classroom. 

Attendance outreach and support from CCNY in collaboration with the attendance team ensures that students are in 
school and receiving classroom instruction. 

Family engagement activities and workshops allow families the opportunity to meet with school and CBO staff to 
learn best practices for supporting their children in academic success. 

Finally, the Community School Forum will showcase the work that students have done this school year and give 
families the opportunity to collaborate with program planning and provide program feedback.  

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services

lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

that it aligns with school day instruction and is taught by school day teachers. CCNY provides after-school curriculum 
recommended by the school administration to support student learning that is aligned with school curriculum.  

3. CCNY runs 4 advisory boards per school year to get student, family, and stakeholder engagement on program 
activities. CCNY will run a Community School Forum at the end of the year to review programming from the past 
school year and get feedback from the community for programming for next year. At family workshops, parents have 
the opportunity to give feedback and speak with staff. 

4. By June 2019, the CSD and school admin will meet formally bi-weekly and informally on a weekly basis. Weekly 
attendance meetings are used to analyze data trends for students and create student and family action plans.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

  P.S. 148Q’s Title III Program provides English Language Learners with supplemental 
instruction in an after-school instructional academy.  Analysis of the EDAT and Star Universal 
Screener indicates a number of our ESL students at the intervention and urgent 
intervention level.  
Some of those risk factors include: achieving 1 or 2 on ELA for two years; achieving 1 or 2 on 
math for two years; at risk of becoming a long-term ELL; scored proficient in terms of scale 
score points but did not test out due to insufficient score in one or more modalities; attendance 
below 90% for the year.  
Students who did not show growth at the advanced level exhibited a decrease in the 
writing/reading strand.  Running Records and On-Demand Writing Samples for these students 
indicate a weakness in reading comprehension and mechanics. 
Analysis of admission's list  indicates 7 third grade, 4 fourth grade and 0 fifth grade students 
were admitted in September from countries outside the United States and do not speak any 
English. 
Our Title III After-school Program has been created to address the needs of the above 
students.  We will offer second, third, fourth and fifth grade classes.  Instruction will be provided 
to these students utilizing Lexia Core 5 Reading, a research-based program shown to improve 
outcomes for English as a New Language Learners in acquiring fundamental literacy skills.   
We will also offer a second grade class and a 3/4 bridge class for newcomers.  Spire 
Phonemic Awareness Program will be used to help students with limited English language skills 
to develop their foundational skills.  Additionally, a portion of the time students will spend in 
enrichment clubs based on student interest ie: dance, photography, art and drama to help them 
develop their expressive and receptive language skills as well as engage in extended 
conversation with classmates.   
The after-school instruction academy will meet a total of 21 weeks on Wednesdays and 
Thursdays from 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. beginning on November 7, 2018 through May 2019, for a 
total of five instructional hours per week.  There will be a total of 6 classes with approximately 
8-10 students per class.  Certified bilingual and ESL teachers will provide supplemental 
instruction in the development of reading behaviors aligned with students instructional levels, 
test taking strategies, mechanics and grammar in alignment with CCLS using ESL 
methodologies to enhance student achievement on the NYSESLAT and NYS ELA.  An assistant 
principal will supervise students and delivery of instruction.  The supervisor will admit and 
discharge students to the program as needed. She will also provide professional development to 
teachers.  Attendance and records to be maintained by Assistant Principal.  Notification to 
parents will be in English and Spanish.  There is no other extended day program taking place at 
the same time as the Title III program.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Teachers will first use a systematic assessment to determine children's instructional reading 
level, and then form groups of children who are reading at approximately the same 
level.  Teachers will implement daily, personalized instruction  that incorporates a variety of 
instructional approaches at students' levels:   
The lessons can provide, depending on level: 
- systematic instruction in phonemic awareness 
- systematic instruction in phonics 
- daily opportunities to increase fluency through oral re-reading of text 
- explicit instruction on comprehension 
- opportunities for writing 
- opportunities to learn a core of high frequency words 
- opportunities to expand vocabulary and develop oral language 
Classes will be set up for our newcomers where they will develop their foundational skills using 
the Spire program.

  The P.S. 148 Title III program will offer adult English classes for the parents of the students 
attending the After School Instructional Academy concurrent with the after 
school instructional academy.  Enrollment will be available to all parents of ENL students in our 
school community. The adult program will address both language immersion for the parents and 
strategies parents may utilize to help their children develop literacy skills. These classes will be 
provided by a licensed and certified ENL teacher and the supervising Assistant Principal for the 
program.   
Topics for each session will be in alignment with the ESL methodologies utilized by classroom 
teachers to enhance student achievement.  Some of the following topics will be 
addressed:  reading aloud to your child, developing conversation around a book with your child, 
moving social language skills to academic language, writing with your child, use of literacy 
strategies to strengthen fluency and reading comprehension, introduction to components of the 
NYSESLAT and ELA assessment.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The results derived from formative and normative assessments including: NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell reading 
levels, ENL Periodic Assessment, ReadyGen PBAs, MOSL, Estrellita, I-Ready and STAR (Renaissance Learning), as well as daily 
teacher observations help to drive instruction to target ELL literacy needs and to establish student learning goals.   
This data indicates a need for focusing on specific language skills to support language proficiency, ie. letter/sound recognition, 
use of temporal and sequencing words for retelling, and character analysis. Both ReadyGen and Fundations (our word work 
curricula) encourage higher order thinking in content areas with emphasis on domain specific vocabulary and academic 
language through predictable and consistent routines.  Our teachers are working to develop  strong Tier 1 core instruction 
which will increase exposure to non-fiction reading and writing.   Students who scored at level 1 or 2 on the ELA will also be 
invited to attend our ENL Afterschool and Morning Academies for instruction in reading complex text and response to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

reading.  Emerging students in second and third grade, as well as new admits with 0-1 year of service, will be invited to attend 
our ENL After-school Academy for instruction with Lexia Learning, Double Dose Fundations or S.P.I.R.E.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The Assistant Principal for ENL, Anna DeLisse, monitors the implementation of the morning and afternoon programs as well as 
the data.  The ENL committee meets weekly to review data and provide specific supports needed by either the students or 
teachers. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 In order to evaluate the success of our ENL program and to ensure that our ENL students meet the AYP goals as set, 
we  examine data derived from NYSESLAT results for each modality, NYSITELL  scores (newcomers), as well as, results from the 
NYS exams: ELA, Math, and Science.  Additionally, we use the school/district report card AMAO tool,  MOSL (administered in 
the beginning and end of the school year), ReadyGen PBAs, I-Ready, STAR (Renaissance Learning), State exams, periodic 
assessments, as well as ongoing teacher observations/assessments/tests and running records.  Students’ portfolios also inform 
teachers  of their students’ progress. 
One area of need in our school is the students that have stalled at the advanced level for more than two years. These students 
receive support within our Tier 2 push-in program and are our focus group for the Afterschool Academy.  Instruction is 
planned to provide strategies for improving vocabulary, comprehension and test taking skills.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The Assistant Principal for ENL, Anna DeLisse, monitors the implementation of the morning and afternoon programs as well as 
the data.  The ENL committee meets weekly to review data and provide specific supports needed by either the students or 
teachers. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 148's very diverse ENL population encompasses newcomers from other countries, ENLs who were born in this country and 
whose families speak limited English, and ENLs who are approaching proficiency but need support with reading and writing 
skills. Students’ acquisition of the multiple dimensions of language is closely monitored and measured so as to plan 
accordingly.  Data derived from the  LABR, NYSESLAT, MOSL assessments, ReadyGen PBAs, I-Ready, STAR (Renaissance 
Learning), ELA and MATH State Exams,  On Our Way To English Assessments, ELA and MATH State Exams , ENL Periodic 
Assessments, Estrellita, ITA assessments, and teacher observations/running records is  used to drive instruction  to meet these 
diverse needs. During grade leader common preps and instructional cabinet meetings,  data derived from the ELA and State 
Math exams is closely analyzed for trends in  State Standard achievement and instruction is planned via backwards planning, 
according to these trends throughout the grades.  Namely, if a student does not meet standards in first grade, his/her 
performanace in the second grade will continue to be below standards. Our school-wide goal continues to be to target 
instruction to ensure students achieve grade appropriate standards and are prepared for the next grade.   In an effort to limit 
referrals for special education settings, our teachers build a strong, rigorous instructional core program (Tier 1) using research 
based materials to target all students’ needs.  This Tier 1 instruction is geared towards English language development. 
Students are assessed daily with either verbal assessment or written work and every 4 - 5 weeks with the ReadyGen PBAs, 
Fountas and Pinnell benchmark, in addition to  teacher made assessments. Within the RTI infrastructure, the teacher uses "The 
Decision Tree" to determine if the student's difficulties are unusual as compared to his/her peers.  Those students who 
demonstrate a need for a more focused and intensive support may move into  a Tier 2 or 3 support - this  intervention support 
for specific skills' needs  is provided by our push-in providers and followed up with formative assessments every 3 - 6 
weeks.   We also provide additional support through the adaptive web-based reading program, I-Ready.  We administer 3 
benchmark assessments through STAR (Renaissance Learning).    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

A review of the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT data reveals that the third grade students scored high in the writing and speaking 
modalities (48 scored high in writing, 39 scored high in speaking). 
Thirty-four fourth grade students scored high in the speaking modality, nine scored high in the listening 
modality but demonstrate reading and writing as the modalities of need.  Thirty-four fifth grade students scored high in the 
speaking modality and  fifteen scored high in the listening modality, but most scored low in the writing modality.  The data 
clearly demonstrates that the areas of focus are the Reading and Writing modalities.  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

NYSESLAT and EDAT data is shared with teachers/grades. The EDAT provides risk levels for individual students.  The Assistant 
Principal for ENL, Anna DeLisse, monitors the implementation of the morning and afternoon programs as well as the 
data.  Students with higher risk levels are invited to the ENL morning and afternoon programs.  The ENL committee meets 
weekly to review data and provide specific supports needed by either the students or teachers. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 School leadership at P.S. 148 has a clear vision and high expectations for ELL student achievement. Students’ progress 
is systematically monitored, our teachers know their students and their individual needs (ie.newcomers, developing, 
and  long term ENLs, as well as SIFE and SWD) and instruction is planned accordingly.  Our teachers and 
administration share the philosophy that complex text aids in developing higher order thinking, therefore, our 
language instruction is aligned with the grade level standards in which college readiness is the goal.  Language 
instruction is delivered within the framework of the following models: Transitional Bilingual Program (TBE) and 
Freestanding ENL.  Specifically, we have the TBE model for our kindergarten, first and second grades based on parent 
choice and numbers of students with the same language background.  The freestanding ENL program for grades 
kindergarten though 5th is organized to include self-contained classes, as well as the push-in model.  The Fundations 
Double Dose program is added for the newcomer beginning group while the ReadyGen program is implemented with 
scaffolds for all ENL students.  The freestanding ENL and bilingual classes are grouped with mixed proficiency 
levels.  Students who have scored Entering or Emerging on the 2017  NYSESLAT  and receive ENL services through the 
pull-out model are grouped together based on proficiency level  to receive stand alone ENL services. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

As per CR Part 154 mandates, language support services are provided by certified teachers through the self-contained TBE 
model, self-contained Freestanding ENL model or the push-in ENL model.  Teachers provide language instruction using ENL 
methodology during the 90 minute ReadyGen literacy block. In order to address the five stages of language acquisition, ENLs 
are grouped according to proficiency level as determined by the NYSITELL/NYESESLAT results. Students who score on the 
Entering level on the NYSESLATor NYSITELL receive 360 minutes of service (180 minutes of standalone and 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL).  Students who score Emerging on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL also receive 360 minutes a week of ENL services 
(90 minutes of standalone, 180 minutes of integrated, and 90 minutes that are flexible).  Students who score Transitioning on 
the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT receive 180 minutes of ENL service per week (90 minutes integrated and 90 minutes of Flexible 
programming).  Students who score Expanding receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL services, and students who scored 
Commanding receive 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL services.  
In our ENL classrooms , ELA instruction is differentiated  within the literacy block and throughout the flow of the day.  Our 
bilingual classes receive the same ENL instruction with the addition of Home Language Instructional  minutes which are 
implemented across the content areas.   
 
 In our TBE program, the use of Home Language Instruction throughout the day varies according to student proficiency in the 
target language. Specifically, students at the Entering level of English language proficiency will receive Home Language 
Instruction  for at least 75% of instructional time.  As the student's English Proficiency level increases, more of the instructional 
day is spent learning English.  Students at the Emerging level receive 60% of instruction in their home language, students at the 
Transitioning level receive 50% of instruction in their home language, and students at the Expanding level receive 25% in their 
home language.  
Key concepts and vocabulary in the content areas of math and social studies are introduced in the home language during the 
first half of the lesson (20 minutes).  Follow-up discussions and review provide further opportunity to develop academic 
language in English as well.   In an effort to ensure that the mandated Home Language  instructional minutes are 
delivered,   Home Language Instruction is delivered within the literacy block as well as during math instruction.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 a. Our Spanish TBE classes in kindergarten through second grade are self-contained models with certified bilingual teachers 
delivering instruction.  Native language instruction is delivered in a 60% - 40% instruction model in the beginning of the 
year.  The percentage of English instruction will increase to 50% and then to 75% based on student needs.  Our Spanish 
Transitional Bilingual Program provides for  a strong Native Language Arts component.  Literacy instruction is provided within 
the Gen Ready program. Concepts are developed in math and social studies in the students’ native language to ensure 
academic progress as they acquire the second language.  Our TBE provides ENLs with full exposure to a standards based core 
curriculum which is in direct alignment with that of mainstream English speaking students.  Math and social studies concepts 
are developed in the students' native language to ensure  progress as they acquire academic vocabulary.   Both our Go Math 
and Science Fusion  programs focus on the use of manipulatives which appeal to students’ individual learning styles.  Social 
studies concepts dovetail with literacy, allowing for the development of both academic and domain specific vocabulary.  Social 
Studies instruction is developed to accommodate the Common Core Instructional Shifts.   Teachers facilitate learning through 
the use of cognates, repetition, visual aids,shared reading and vocabulary infusion.  Interactive word walls reflect vocabulary 
and sight words being learned in English and also in Spanish in all content areas. The goal of our Transitional Bilingual Program 
is to provide the tools students need to achieve English proficiency.   
b. In our ENL self-contained and push-in programs, language instruction is differentiated in order to best provide for the 
students’ language needs. The ENL teacher will provide support in the content areas through our push-in co-teaching model 
where he/she supports and scaffolds Tier I core instruction.  Content area lessons are common core aligned and our ENL 
students are immersed in this classroom structure.   ENL students receive tiered instruction within the scaffolds of the 
ReadyGen program which allows for differentiated instruction and ongoing assessment in order to promote  English language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

proficiency. This program incorporates the following qualitative measures: levels of meaning, structure and language 
conventionality and clarity. Students are provided with extensive opportunities for oral language practice, vocabulary and 
syntax development.   Content areas are presented with a focus on cognate awareness.  Math and Science instruction is 
provided through hands-on activities via the GoMath and the Science Fusion programs.  In all program models, social studies 
concepts dovetail with literacy, allowing for the development of both academic and domain specific vocabulary.  Social Studies 
instruction is developed to accommodate the Common Core Instructional Shifts.   Teachers facilitate learning through the use 
of cognates, repetition, visual aids,shared reading and vocabulary infusion. Social Studies instruction is provided with the 
NYCDOE Passport to Social Studies Curriculum.   Classes are formed to provide the optimal environment for academic language 
learning.. The use of academic language is encouraged during group work to ensure that students have ample opportunity to 
practice their communication and comprehension skills.  Exposure to high quality English language literature, poetry and music 
in our print-rich classrooms helps motivate students to attain language proficiency.  
 In order to provide NL support in the ENL programs, we provide multicultural libraries in the classrooms and  our school 
library.  Word to word glossaries and bilingual dictionaries are distributed to ELL students. Teachers of ells label objects in 
classroom (ie. chair, desk, clock etc).  Additionally, anchor charts with pictures and text are hung throughout the room as a 
reference.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

In order to ensure that ENLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, newly admitted students who are identified 
as ENLs with Spanish dominance on the HLIS are administered the Spanish LAB to determine fluency and literacy in their native 
language. Once these students have been appropriately placed, the classroom teachers/push-in teachers/SETTS and related 
services teachers use formal and informal formative assessments to drive instruction.  Within the Tier I core instruction, 
teachers set short-term goals and use informal assessments every 3 - 6 weeks to monitor progress with targeted 
students.  Teachers in our TBE program use components of the Estrellita assessment as a diagnostic tool paired with school-
wide assessments to assess  students and to plan for differentiated instruction.  Additional teacher created informal 
assessments (stemming from the ReadyGen program and Go Math), quizzes and check-ins are utilized to track students' 
home  language understanding and progress.   These assessments are in alignment with the core curriculum standards.  
Translated versions of content area state exams are available to those students who meet the criteria.  If the translated version 
is not available a qualified translator is used.  
Students in our TBE are provided with Spanish versions of the MOSL (measures of student learning) to evaluate learning.  
Our Science Fusion program and our NYCDOE K-8 Passport to Social Studies curricular program provide teachers with common 
core aligned Spanish translations of formative assessments.      
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

In order to differentiate instruction for ENL subgroups, P.S. 148 targets these students and provides support services as 
follows: 
a. SIFE students are identified during the registration process.  During the parent interview, information is collected to 
ascertain the student’s level of education.  The HLIS and the parent survey/program selection form provide information as to 
the extent of the student’s formal education.  The NYSITELL and Spanish LAB (if applicable) results determine placement in the 
appropriate language program. Parents remain involved through the support and collaboration of the ENL coordinator and 
parent coordinator 
 SIFE students may receive tiered instruction from SETTS personnel through the push-in model. Instructional needs are also 
addressed in the extended day and Title III afterschool programs.  Continuous assessment (i.e. ENL interim assessment, 
ELA/Math assessments, MOSL assessments, performance based assessments (PBA) individual conferences etc.) drive 
instruction to support social and academic language development in all content areas.  Students who demonstrate delays and 
lack age appropriate skills may be placed in a different grade for split session as an intervention step.  
b.  Newcomers identified as ENLs are placed in a language program based on their scores  and parents'  choice.  These students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

receive CCLS aligned intensive English language instruction in both the TBE and ENL program model to enhance language 
acquisition.  Scaffolds within the ReadyGen program provide additional support. Studies show that children learn from 
listening to each other. Best practices allow for this interaction through collaborative group work. One of our instructional 
plans is the pairing of newcomers with English proficient (EP) speakers.  These EP students model the target language and can 
also serve as interpreters.  
ENLs who have been in school less than one year (newcomers) take the NYSESLAT assessment in lieu of the ELA state exam, 
however, ENLs who have been in English speaking schools for more than one year must take both the NYSESLAT and the ELA 
assessments.  Our rigorous curriculum prepares these students for these mandated exams. ENL students also have the 
opportunity to attend extended day small group tutoring and the ENL Afterschool Academy to enhance their language 
acquisition and development.   
c. ENL students with 4- 6 years of language service are identified using BESIS data,  RYOS and UYRE ATS reports.  These 
students are assessed and monitored via the just right reading level assessment, MOSL, ReadyGen PBA,  ENL Periodic 
Assessment, ELA, Math, and Science State standardized exams.    This information provides teachers with the data necessary 
to differentiate instruction.   The ENL push-in teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher to ensure that strategies 
used  are in direct alignment with the students' goals and the core curriculum.  Extra periods of literacy instruction are 
scheduled each week for these students.  The ENL teacher provides language support through strategy lessons, read alouds, 
guided reading and interactive reading and writing lessons.  The SBST,  SETTS,  speech, occupational and physical therapists 
and the AIS teams may also provide support for these students as well.   Long term ENLs receive additional support in our 
extended day programs which can include small group tutoring, inquiry target teams, debate team, drumming club. 
d. Long Term ENLs  who have completed more than six years receive academic intervention with ENL, SETTS, speech, physical 
and/or occupational therapy, guidance, and  inquiry team support.  ENLs with more than 6 years of language service receive 
the same supports as noted in 6c. 
e. Former ENLs, specifically those who have tested proficient on the NYSESLAT in the past two years, may continue in their 
language program so as to help them transition into the general education environment. Additionally, these students are 
provided with the same testing modifications as the ENLs.      
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The IEP is used to determine the language goals for ENL-SWDs. All ENL-SWDs receive mandated services in the appropriate 
program.  The classroom teacher/special ed teacher/SETTS provider meet during common preps to discuss IEP mandates and 
student progress.   Students with disabilities whose IEP indicates a need for ENL service receive the mandated ENL/TBE 
instructional unit requirement based on their LAT or LABR score (see chart below).  Our ENL SWDs are afforded access to all 
language programs utilized in our mainstream classrooms.  Instructional strategies include scaffolding, higher level thinking 
(students think critically and are encouraged to explain how they arrive at a conclusion - Danielson's Framework for Teaching), 
vocabulary support with visuals for academic language proficiency (Isabel Beck  "Bringing Words to Life: Robust Vocabulary 
Instruction").  
The ReadyGen Program is used by all teachers (general and special ed) and allows for small group differentiated instruction, 
while at the same time enhancing the development of vocabulary and comprehension skills.  ENL students with special needs 
are grouped within this  program based on literacy skills.  Language service and support is provided through guided 
reading/text based conversation and the team talk routine during small group instruction.  
 The NYCDOE K-8 Passport to Social Studies Curriculum offers teachers specific strategies and activities for students needing 
extra support or challenges.  GoMath and the Science Fusion programs provide opportunities for  "hands-on" learning and 
tactile reinforcement of specific grade level concepts. Small group re-teach is embedded within the GoMath program. The 
Sonday, Orton Gillingham and Wilson programs are available as resource tools for the CTT and SETTS teachers to use as 
intervention tools for their ELL students.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our mission is to meet the diverse needs of ENL-SWDs within the least restrictive environment requires flexibility in rigorous 
curricular, instructional, and schedule planning.  ENL-SWDs are exposed to the same academic learning environment as their 
non-disabled peers. All ICT and 12:1 classes have prep periods with the same teachers and materials as the general ed 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

students.  All trips and extra-curricular activities include the special education classes. 
Our school has created a daily, common prep schedule which accommodates collaborative planning time within and across the 
grades. For example, our content area teams (comprised of  K through 5 mainstream and special education teachers), work 
together to identify IEP language goals and share instructional strategies that target students' specific needs. Curriculum teams 
attend grade appropriate professional development and then turnkey information to their colleagues.  
Our flexibility in scheduling allows for collaboration between the classroom teacher, special education teachers and the push-
in ENL teachers.  These meetings are scheduled during monthly grade leader preps, weekly common preps and lunch periods.  
ENLS-SWDs are afforded access to all school programs. 
ENL-SWDs are placed in the appropriate and least restrictive environment as mandated by their IEP.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The goal of all intervention programs is to provide differentiated instruction in a small group setting where the reduced 
student to teacher ratio allows for multiple opportunities for interaction among students to develop auditory, listening, and 
vocabulary skills around content. Active engagement and dialogue around content being learned allows students to build 
academic language and achieve higher levels of understanding of concepts taught. Our Curriculum is rigorous and level 
appropriate. The methods by which the standards based instruction is delivered is varied, differentiated, and goal driven to 
enable a match between what is being taught and the student’s ability to comprehend. 
Skills analysis of our NYS ELA and Math results allow our teachers to determine which common core standards need to be 
addressed or re-taught.  Information derived from this data helps teachers across the grades to plan accordingly. Teachers 
study trends and patterns of meeting common core standards to ensure students are meeting goals for their grade level.  For 
example,  a student  not meeting the math standard for word problems using four operations in the upper grades is a red flag 
for the lower grade teacher to ascertain that all students are proficient in solving word problems using two operations.  There 
is communication and accountability between our teachers across the grades. 
 In order to address the ENL subgroup that did not make adequate progress on the 2017 ELA and Math State exams, 
intervention programs will target these  ENLs and provide reinforcement in content areas.  This year, we will continue using 
the ReadyGen reading program. This program provides native language support through the use of  cognates and 
labeling.  Instructional strategies include scaffolding (students build upon prior knowledge as well as each other's comments 
and ideas), higher level thinking (students think critically and are encouraged to explain how they arrive at a conclusion - 
Danielson's Framework for Teaching), and vocabulary support for academic language proficiency (Isabel Beck's  "Bringing 
Words to Life: Robust Vocabulary Instruction"). 
GoMath and the Science Fusion Programs provide  "hands-on" learning and tactile reinforcement of specific grade level 
concepts. our Social Studies program is common core aligned and provides an enduring understanding focus for all units 
taught.  ENLs and ENL-SWDs benefit form the extra materials such as charts, maps, pictures and cds embedded within the 
program.  Students receive native language support within all intervention programs through the use of visuals, translated 
versions of text, cds, and verbal translation. 
To meet the needs of the ENL-SWD subgroup that did not make AYP,  the Sonday, Orton Gillingham, Wilson and S.P.I.R.E. 
programs are available as resource tools for the CTT and SETTS teachers to use as intervention. The IEP  helps to determine the 
language goals for this subgroup.  Our ENL SWDs are afforded access to all literacy programs utilized in our mainstream 
classrooms.  Instructional strategies include scaffolding (students build upon prior knowledge as well as each other's 
comments and ideas), higher level thinking (students think critically and are encouraged to explain how they arrive at a 
conclusion - Danielson's Framework for Teaching), and vocabulary support for academic language proficiency (Isabel 
Beck  "Bringing Words to Life: Robust Vocabulary Instruction"). 
 Our long-term ENLs who have stalled at the advanced level on the NYSESLAT receive language support in our Title III ENL 
Afterschool Academy. For this subgroup, emphasis will be placed on the reinforcement of grammar and writing conventions. 
ENL students (including newcomers and long-term ENLs) are also targeted  in our extended day tutoring sessions. 
The Lexia Learning computer program is used for this subgroup of ENLs. 
The Schoolwide Inquiry Teams provide reinforcement in all content areas. Teachers meet regularly with students to provide 
differentiated instruction and to determine and assess short-term goals for each student. 
ENL students who have been evaluated by our SBST and whose IEP indicates Spanish receive SETTS and related services in their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

native language. Our Spanish bilingual social worker, guidance counselor and  school psychologist provide intervention and 
counseling in the student's NL.  ENL students in our TBE classes may receive NL support across the content areas.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our reading program is the ReadyGen program and our math program is GoMath.    During the 2016-2017 school term we 
added I-Ready and STAR (Renaissance Learning).  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ENLs are part of  the following departmentalized school wide programs:  project-based learning, Theater Arts, music, 
physical education, visual arts and science.  ENLs are invited to participate in extra-curricular activities such as extended day 
small group tutoring, debate team, drumming club, social studies club, math club, chorus, band, ENL Afterschool Academy, and 
summer school.  Invitations with tear-offs are sent home in the homework folder.  Attendance is taken each day to ensure full 
participation and representation in all programs.    The principal and assistant principals work with the ENL coordinator, 
classroom teachers and parent coordinator to ensure all ENL students are accounted for and placed properly.  Parents are 
notified in writing of the commencement dates and schedule of these programs.  Attendance is taken daily to ensure full 
participation and representation of ENLs in all programs.  In the case of poor attendance, the guidance counselors will place 
follow up phone calls to ensure consistency within the program.  This year our Title III funded ENL Afterschool  and Morning 
Academy will address the ENL subgroup who did not show growth on the NYSESLAT or scored a 1 or 2 on the ELA.  Our goal for 
this program is to provide test taking strategies to promote success and address annual measurable achievement objectives 
(AMAO).   Newcomers are also invited to attend our afterschool academy.  Lexia Learning is the program used for these 
ELLs.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instruction for ENLs is planned to include additional materials, such as: anchor charts, picture graphs, vocabulary 
pictures,  Venn diagrams. Computer programs such as MyOn are used with  Ipads in an effort to support language acquisition 
and increase exposure to technology. Newcomers receive language support from our listening centers and are also invited  our 
ENL Afterschool Academy.  This program uses Lexia Learning.  Students' language acquisition skills are assessed and they are 
grouped accordingly.  The Double Dose Fundations and S.P.I.R.E. program provide practice with the phonetic and syntactic 
aspects of the English language. 
In addition to curriculum materials previously noted,  language instructional materials used as supplement may include 
Focused Reading Instruction from Teacher Created Materials, A Chorus of Cultures/Developing Literacy Through Multicultural 
poetry, Words Their Way and Fundations in the lower grades.  All students have access to enhancement program with our 
computer teacher and in their classrooms.  All classrooms have Smartboards that provide access  to websites that may 
enhance students' learning.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In addition to the aforementioned model descriptions, native language support for our ENL students in TBE and ENL programs 
is provided through labelled classrooms, bilingual word walls, translated content area materials,  multicultural libraries 
(classroom and school library), the Lexia Learning computer technology program on laptops, and bilingual word-to -word 
glossaries and dictionaries which are distributed for instructional use and as a resource for State exams.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 All required support services correspond to our ENLs' ages and grade levels.   Schedules are arranged to facilitate collaboration 
between teachers in order to address the goals outlined for students in all grades.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 All staff at P.S. 148 are expected to attend both in-house and off-site  professional development. The ENL coordinator 
provides professional development for the pupil accounting secretary and parent coordinator.  This PD is intended to provide 
sensitivity training for interaction with newly admitted students and their families, as well as, the essential components the 
LEP identification process. Our parent coordinator (Luzaida Acevedo) and secretaries (Cindy Curras and Bessie Velissarios) 
receive training to understand the components of registering a new students to our school and the paperwork that needs to 
be distributed.  These workshops also focus on creating a welcoming environment for newcomers and transfer 
students.  Additionally, our parent coordinator attends ACS, attendance and Language Access workshops.  Our school 
secretaries also attend off site workshops - ie. training for creating and understanding Excel spreadsheets. 
Additionally,  P.S. 148 offers  an array of in house and off site  professional development opportunities  for all (monolingual 
and ENL) teachers. These workshops are provided by our assistant principals, ENL coordinator, teachers assigned to turn key, 
and our field support center personnel. Last year we implemented an instructional cabinet which meets weekly on Thursday 
afternoon to address the Common Core instructional shifts,  to study complex texts and assist in implementing standards 
based and core curriculum aligned social studies and science programs.  Outside consultants are invited on an as needed 
basis. Teachers and administration personnel who are members of this cabinet also attend monthly and biweekly workshops 
and seminars (ie. Leadership Series : Implementing A Response To Intervention Model To Support ENLs' Academic 
Achievement) at various sites throughout the city.  All information is turn keyed during our designated monthly and weekly PD 
sessions.  Additionally, all staff  (related services providers, paraprofessionals, secretaries and school aides) attend ongoing 
workshops  throughout the school year.  Workshop attendees turnkey pertinent information to their colleagues during grade 
leader, common preps, Monday professional learning and full day staff development.   
Each month during the common prep, teachers and service providers (SETTS, ENL) meet to "backward" plan for writing 
within  the ReadyGen unit for informational as well as narrative writing.  Teachers are also invited to professional development 
sessions on the second week of each month to plan for any modifications needed to incorporate for ENL, ENL SWD and sped 
students to ensure that all students meet common core aligned instructional objectives. This PD will focus on using different

materials, different entry points and different layers of coaching/scaffolding. Teachers attend interdisciplinary meetings to 
work on developing systems for differentiating instruction for ENL subgroups in all curriculum areas.     
Our guidance counselors (Jennifer Lane and Zayra Gonzalez) attends PD provided by the ENL coordinator and administration 
which focuses on the ENL student needs and how to ensure these students are included in all opportunities for a positive 
transition to middle school.  Additionally, In order to provide support  to all fifth grade students as they transition from the 
elementary level to the middle school our fifth grade teachers and our guidance counselors organize an assembly in our school 
auditorium where a representatives from schools in our district provide information about the application process and special 
programs. In this assembly the students are given the opportunity for a question and answer period.  Additionally, our 
guidance counselors arrange for  fifth grade teachers and students to visit the zoned middle school where they attend an 
orientation to familiarize themselves with the school's location and school environment.  At this articulation meeting, the ENL 
students are directed to the ENL Academy to ensure appropriate placement for ENLs.  Our guidance counselors attend 
"Respect for All"  PD sessions highlighting bullying issues and during respect for all week,  the guidance counselor turnkeys this 
PD to our parents and staff including all teachers, ENL coordinator, assistant principals, parent coordinator, paraprofessionals, 
and any SETTS personnel working with our students. Additionally, the guidance counselors organize an assembly program for 
our students during Respect for All week in February which creates awareness and defines bullying while providing real life 
strategies for coping with this issue. The guidance counselors will host an assembly (Never Give Up Encourage Other, Do your 
Best) in November. This program focuses on building character and coping with bullying. Additionally,  NYPD personnel are 
invited by the guidance counselors to speak to fifth grade students about cyber-bullying.  The guidance counselors present a 
PowerPoint presentation in all fifth grade classes to help with the transition to middle school.  Topics include peer pressure, 
test anxiety, good organizational skills, how to adjust to the departmental schedule, and middle school teacher expectations.  
Teachers who require ENL training receive professional development with staff developers from the field support center to 
ensure a minimum of 7.5 hours of ENL PD as per Jose P.  All teachers sign in and receive an agenda. A minutes recorder is 
assigned and next steps are discussed at the culmination of PD session.  All records are maintained by our administrative 
staff.   This ENL training is provided to ensure that teachers will be able to address the specific language needs of their ENL 
students.  Our ReadyGen PBA backward planning provides a systematic plan for language support for our ENLs so that they will 
meet learning objectives.. Students are made aware of skills needed to master the topic and instruction is developed to align 
with meeting the common core standards.  Teachers also attend GoMath PD sessions which are CCLS aligned and address any 
scaffolding needs for ENLs.  
This PD is  provided during monthly planning meetings, during common preps, lunch periods and full day PD (Election Day, B/Q 
day).  PD will be developed to teach sensitivity to the unique needs of language learners and provide strategies for developing 
academic language for these students.   
   
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ENL and Bilingual teachers attend both on-site and off-site Professional Development workshops which are aligned to the 
common core standards and geared directly to ELL and Bilingual students needs based on the spring 2017 NYSESLAT data. We 
are participating in an ENL cohort which receives professional development from the Queens North Field Support 
Center titled "Pathways to Success - Advanced Literacy for ELLs".  In addition the teachers will receive professional 
development on QTEL strategies (Quality Teaching for English Learners).   For each PLO, teacher's attendance is tracked and 
agendas are submitted to the office secretary.  
Accordingly, teachers attend staff development workshops on site during the designated Professional Development time on 
Monday afternoons from 2:30-3:50.  These workshops are geared towards the needs of students based on the data 
results from the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT test and the ELA and Math state exams.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
All teachers of ELLs have annual individual meetings with parents.  These meetings occur during the parent engagement time 
on Tuesday afternoons.  During the meetings, teachers discuss results from the previous NYSESLAT assessment, as well as the 
individual student's language progress and language development needs.  When there is a need for interpretation or 
translation, the teachers are able to utilize available paraprofessionals.  We currently have paraprofessionals who speak a 
variety of languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, Urdu, and Chinese.  If there is a need for a different language the 
teachers call Translation Unit at the Department of Education. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our Parent Coordinator maintains an open door policy with our parents.  She works closely with the ENL Coordinator, 
Guidance Counselors and Administration to ensure that parents feel welcome and comfortable when voicing their 
concerns.  The Parent Coordinator is involved in outreach, providing orientations both before and throughout the school year. 
These orientations are presented to inform parents of the various programs and activities in our school. Notices are translated 
into  English, Spanish and the various community languages. The school staff and administrators offer a series a series of 
workshops throughout the year to address parental needs. Workshops and materials are provided in both  English and 
Spanish, and translated into any other language when requested by a parent. The Translation Service phone number has been 
provided to our staff and is also visible in the main office along with Translation Forms, Parent Preferred Language Form for 
newly admitted students and their family, I Speak Card is also available at the main entrance, Language Identification Guide, 
Language Card for the School Safety Officer to assist ENL parents.  Staff is also utilized for language and written 
translation.  Times for parent workshops vary to accommodate parent's schedules. Activities include International Food 
Festivities for our parents to share their own experiences and to familiarize themselves with the various cultures within our 
school community.   
Our school has utilized Community Based Organizations such as the Queens Public Library, Queens Child Guidance Center, 
Western Queens Consultation Center, Child Health Plus, New York Hospital/Cornell Hospital and the Corona Health Center, 
Immigration Advocacy, Advocates for Children, U.F.T. Dial A Teacher, and Financial Institutions.  We have aligned with the 
NYCDOE adult education program to provide our parents with free English classes.  These are offered two evenings per week 
including Saturdays. 
The coming 2017/18 school year,  P.S. 148 is becoming a Community School which will have the Child Center for New York as 
the main CBO and will continue our collaboration with the New York Junior Tennis League in our school.  Bilingual personnel 
are available within these organizations and these opportunities are available for all students. Through our partnership with 
these organizations, workshops given by CBO’s are informed of our ENL population and any material that is available is 
requested,duplicated and if necessary translated for our ENL population either through the CBO, staff or NYCDOE Translation 
Service Department.  All information is distributed in various languages (Spanish, Urdu, Bengali, Chinese, Hindi,and Punjabi) 
necessary to accommodate our school community.   
In the beginning of the school year, our Parent Coordinator distributes the Parents Preferred Language Form along with a 
parent assessment survey that asks for parental concerns and needs. Evaluation forms are given at the end of workshops to 
determine effectiveness and for parental input .  Information gathered then is used to plan and develop workshops throughout 
the school year in conjunction with the Administration and Staff to address those requests.  Our Parent Coordinator always 
maintains a welcoming environment, working to increase and encourage parent participation,  conducts outreach to the 
parents in all areas not just limited to academic concerns, attend meetings with staff and Administration when requested, 
serves as liaison between the school, Community Based Organizations and parents and advocates on behalf of the parent.   
Our school hosts several content specific Open Houses during the school year.  Our parents can experience first-hand, the 
instruction their children receive in literacy, mathematics, science and social studies.

1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

-All parents complete student emergency contact cards. Staff reviews parent language preference indicated on 
cards. 

-Staff reviews the RCPL report from ATS which identifies parent preferred spoken language and written language.  

-Surveys will be sent home to parents confirming language preferences. 

-We review the Home Language Identification survey which indicates the parents preferred language for 
communication.
