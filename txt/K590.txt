Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

MISSION  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of MECPS is to provide our diverse student population (grades 6-12) with a rigorous college readiness 
program involving extra and co-curricular activities, and a supportive environment that recognizes individual learning 
styles and strengths and prepares them to graduate from MECPS with both a regents high school diploma and an 
Associates Degree from Medgar Evers College. Students are immersed in an academically challenging course of study 
with requirements that include four years of English Language Arts (ELA), Mathematics, Science, Technology and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

three years of foreign language. Students must also complete at least one Advanced Placement course from the 
nineteen being offered. Student creativity, character development and social responsibility are cultivated through 
individualized guidance, college advisement, sports teams, clubs, fine and performing arts events, community service 
and mentorships. The Mission of Medgar Evers College Preparatory School is to engage students in grades 6 - 12 
college readiness program that prepares them to graduate from MECPS with both a Regents high school diploma and 
an Associates Degree from Medgar Evers College.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Some of the types of innovative, teacher-led practices that Medgar Evers College Preparatory School (MECPS) 
currently uses to promote student success are as follows: 1. Common prep time in a number of departments (English, 
Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, Foreign Language) where teachers are involved in planning of instructions and 
reviewing of students' work.  

2. Advanced Placement (AP) Summer Institute for students. Teachers lead meetings with prospective AP students 
during the summer to prepare in preparation for the AP courses that begin in the fall term. 

3. AP night, this is a program in which AP teachers meet with parents of AP students at the beginning of the term to 
educate parents about the requirements for their AP classes as well as strategies for being successful in the courses 
and on the AP examinations. 

4. The use of the Tuesday New York Times by several departments to incorporate world events in instruction across 
the curricula. This initiative illustrates to students how the various disciplines are connected. 

5. All students in grades 6 - 8 are required to study Mandarin. Teachers incorporate cultural songs, dances and short 
documentary and visits to the Chinese communities in order to give students real exposure to the language and 
culture. By the end of the eighth grade, students are able to take the LOTE in Chinese and by the end of the 10th 
grade, many students sit for the AP Chinese examination. It should be noted that these are all non-native speakers. 

 

Some of the other collaborative practices that Medgar Evers College has includes "Bring Your Parent to School." This is 
a program where all sixth grade parents are required to spend an entire day shadowing their child in the sixth grade 
during September and October of the fall term. The objective of this program is to provide the parents with firsthand 
knowledge of a typical day in the school life of their child. The parents and teachers usually develop a very special 
relationship after this visit. The parents also meet with the Principal at the end of the day and discuss their 
experience. This is a mandatory program in which 100% of the sixth grade parents participate. 

Grades 6 - 8 are considered early high school and the school year is extended to include July and a part of August. The 
extension of the school year is a necessity because of the rigor of the course of study in these grades. 

Students in grade seven take the following regents examination: a)Integrated Algebra, b)Geometry, c)Living 
Environment and d)World History. 

In the eighth grade, students take the following regents examination: a)physics or earth science, b)US History, 
c)Algebra 2 Trigonometry or Geometry, d)English or 3) LOTE in Chinese. 

Grade 9 - 10 - These grades are considered high school grades where students complete their regents examinations 
and can choose electives from 18 AP courses. 

Grades 11 - 12 - These grades are considered early college. Students who qualify can take a maximum of 16 credits 
per semester at Medgar Evers College and earn an Associate's Degree in Biology or Computer Science. Students who 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

are not in this program can continue taking AP courses and College Now courses as well as other electives offered by 
the school. 

MECPS students at Medgar Evers College take all level 200 courses except for English and they are integrated into the 
regular undergraduate population thus getting an early college experience in 11th and 12th grade. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special student populations are learning disabled and need extra academic support after school, outside of the 
regular school needs and time management. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school's academic success has been outstanding . The graduation rate of the students has been above 94.5% for 
the past five years. MECPS students are admitted into some of the most prestigious colleges and universities in the 
United States including the Ivy Leagues. The school's average SAT score in 2018 was 1000. This year, over 498 
students wrote more than 900 AP examinations.  

According to US News and World Report, the school is ranked No. 77 out of 876 schools in New York State. The school 
is also ranked in the top 10% in the United States. In 2010, the school won the College Board Inspiration Award for its 
outstanding AP program. 

The school's success is not just limited to its AP program. The school has an outstanding performing arts and athletics 
program. Despite the fact that the school lacks a gymnasium, it won the PSAL Girls Basketball Championship in 2010.  

Our greatest challenges are space and not enough resources to support the programs that we have .

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Medgar Evers College Prep, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

[Medgar Evers College Prep] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38

or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses the Scantron Corporation online Performance Series reading test to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. 
The test provides an individualized measure of student instructional reading ability. It is a computer-adaptive diagnostic test 
that is able to pinpoint the proficiency level of students. According to the data collected by the Performance Series diagnostic, 
_____% of the ELLs are at a 4th grade reading level, 50% fall between a 6th-7th grade reading level, and ____% are at or above 
a 9th grade level. Of the three students who are Intermediate ELLs, one reads at a 4th grade level and two read between a 5-
6th grade level.This means that 72% of the ELLs are below high school reading level. Since ____% of the ELLs at the school 
have tested at the Advanced level on the NYSESLAT, in order to support these students to score proficient on the exam, there 
needs to be a focus on improving literacy. In addition to content-area textbooks that are on ELLs’ instructional level, the ESL 
class focuses on building literacy skills. Teaching students strategies for approaching a text through questioning, analysis of 
details, story mapping, and using context clues, are essential. There is also a focus on teaching academic vocabulary that 
students will encounter across content areas.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The overall success of our program is measured by the quality of instruction delivered by the ESL teacher and other content 
area teachers, as observed by the school administration. It is also measured by the increase in our parent participation and 
parent involvement in the school through the SLT and PTA. ELLs' academic progress is measured by student transcripts and 
credit accumulation as well as conferencing with ELLs done by the ESL teacher and guidance counselors. We see improvement 
in our ELLs English proficiency through year-to-year growth in English proficiency levels.  This will be measured by using the 
results of both the NYSESLAT exam, as well as the students success in ELA classes and on the ELA Common Core Regents 
Exam.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Historically, 10-15% of the ELLs at the school are at the Intermediate level. The school does not usually have students at the 
Beginning level. 85-90% are Advanced. Usually a 9th grade student who has entered at the Intermediate level will move up to 
Advanced by 10th grade. This year there are _____________freshmen ELLs, ____ sophomores, ____ junior and ____ senior. In 
the last five years, the school has always had more ELLs in 9th grade than in any other grade level. This reflects the increasing 
proficiency of ELLs as they move from one grade level to the next. The ESL program has had success in improving the 
proficiency level of its ELLs.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              ENL as a stand-alone course is offered one period a day, five days a week to all ENL students, regardless of 
student proficiency level.  Integrated ENL is offered in ELA classes, with the ENL  teacher pushing in one period a day, five days 
a week, regardless of student proficiency level.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                The content area classes ELLs take are inclusive general education classes delivered by teachers certified in the 
content areas. Instruction is given in English. The self-contained ESL program supports student work in the content area classes 
of English and Social Studies. The ESL teacher provides ELLs with support in their other content area classes during push-in 
periods and tutoring sessions held during student and teacher free periods. Tutoring is also available after school. Content 
area teachers use heterogenous grouping of students during group work to support ELLs. The ESL teacher works with content 
area teachers to develop word walls in content area classrooms to support vocabulary acquisition. Teachers in social studies 
classes teach students how to annotate readings by modeling the technique and having students practice using annotation 
while they read content area texts. Teachers across content areas have begun to teach students vocabulary specific to formal 
argument and to ask students to identify details in the text that support claims students are making within the context of the 
content area. This instructional focus is aligned with the school’s adoption of the Common Core Learning Standards. These 
techniques have enriched ELL language development. 
The ESL teacher provides integrated ENL services in all ELL student ELA classes, regardless of profiency level.  The teacher 
provides support to the ELL students by providing additional CCLS aligned materials. 
Currently the ESL classroom has a library catering to both the general body and ESL students.  Books that support ELLs in 
content areas are available in the ESL classroom library as well. All content area classes offer textbooks in students’ native 
languages, when available, to support the students' native language.  In addition, glossaries designed specifically for ELLs are 
made available by the ESL teacher for individual student use to further support the students' native language. 
      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                The ESL teacher works with one of the Spanish teachers to administer a Spanish-language diagnostic at the beginning 
of the school year to measure Spanish-speaking ELLs proficiency levels in their native language. Currently there are no ELLs 
with native languages besides Spanish at the school.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We don’t currently have students identified as SIFE. An ELL identified as SIFE would be given 2 periods of self-contained ESL 
per day, as well as received 1-2 periods of push-in ESL daily. SIFEs would be paired with advanced-level ELLs in various content 
area classes as a way of providing peer-to-peer support in addition to support provided by the teacher. The ESL teacher 
currently has a collection of graphic novels of texts currently part of the school's ELA curriculum to support instruction in ELA.  
ELL Newcomers are informally interviewed by the ESL teacher to determine how comfortable the student is with attending 
school in the US. The NYSESLAT scores are also reviewed to determine English proficiency if the student has been in the US 1 
year or longer. If the student appears to be having difficulty adjusting to schooling within the US, the ESL teacher will refer the 
student to the bilingual guidance counselor, if the student's native language is Spanish. If the newcomer is in his/her junior 
year of high school and is scheduled to take the ELA Regents exam, the ESL teacher will provide additional practice with the 
exam during self-contained ESL classes. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

ELLs who have received 4-6 years of ESL services and have shown continual and steady improvement in English Language 
proficiency will be monitored to measure whether or not their proficiency continues to improve. Those whose proficiency 
levels have plateaued will be given targeted instruction in the modality in which their NYSESLAT scores are the lowest. 
ELLs who have completed 6 years of ESL services will be given targeted instruction in the modality in which their NYSESLAT 
scores are the lowest. They will also be given a reading diagnostic, such as the Bader, to give the ESL teacher additional 
information about their reading level. These students will be given additional vocabulary and reading comprehension 
instruction as necessary. 
Former ELLs are given the opportunity to continue in an ESL class in addition to the ELA class that corresponds to their grade 
level. Former ELLs are also given extended time on formal assessments, including state and district mandated testing, as well 
as the use of glossaries and dictionaries in native languages. The ESL teacher tracks the progress made by ELLs who have 
reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT, providing academic support when needed.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The guidance counselors identify who the ELL-SWDs at the school are at the beginning of each school year. They then work 
with the ESL teacher and related services teacher to program ELL-SWDs into both ESL and SETSS classes, ensuring that these 
students receive all mandated services. ELL-SWDs are often given push-in ESL services in a content area class in addition to 
their ESL and SETSS classes. The ESL teacher and related services teacher meet frequently to discuss the needs and progress of 
ELL-SWDs. Visuals are used to illustrate vocabulary lessons. Graphic organizers are used to plan writing assignments before 
students are asked to complete writing tasks. Pre-reading strategies, such as text-previewing and accessing prior knowledge by 
discussing the themes of texts, are used before read alouds and independent reading. Teachers provide ELL-SWDs with 
outlines of notes that can be annotated during direct-instruction.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Curricular flexibility is achieved through co-planning between the ESL teacher, the related services and content area teachers. 
Teachers are instructionally flexible in designing lessons for ELL-SWDS through differentiating the assessments they assign 
students. Students identified as ELL-SWD are scheduled into both self-contained ESL classes and SETSS resource room classes. 
This ensures that students are provided with both mandated services. The ESL and related services teachers review IEPs of ELL-
SWDs together to discuss what strategies work best to address student academic needs.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Currently, the ESL teacher pushes into freshmen Social Studies classes. Advanced ELLs are programmed for both ESL and ELA 
classes. Teachers from all departments are available during student lunch two days a week for tutoring. A teacher from the 
math, social studies, ELA, and science departments provide tutoring for students after school. Materials in students’ native 
language are available, as necessary. The library is available throughout the school day and after school for students who need 
extended time to complete projects or for completing online enrichment activities. Through professional development 
beginning at the start of the academic year, teachers have been made aware of which students in their classes are ELLs; they 
were given the list by grade level and language proficiency. They have also been given data about the ELLs in their classes.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year, we will be adding Integrated ENL services for our ENL students in their ELA class.  This will be done by the ENL 
teacher working collaboratively with the ELA teachers    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Currently we do not see a need to discontinue any of our services for the upcoming school year.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

Student programs are open to all students.  Students enroll in school programs via their guidance counselor or by attending 
meetings the first day the program meets. The ESL teacher offers after-school tutoring for ELLs every Tuesday and Thursday for 
an  hour. More in-depth help with homework, projects, and study skills are offered at that time. There are several music 
groups that meet after school. Participation in these groups are determined by student performance in their classes.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The school has concentrated on incorporating current technologies into classrooms for student use. SMART Boards are 
available in 95% of all classrooms.  Teachers have received ongoing training on its use during in-house professional 
development. This has enabled students to interact with lesson plans teachers have created incorporating the internet, i.e., 
planet earth, Smithsonian and skedula, etc. There are several computer carts available for classroom use, as well as a 
computer lab. These are used for research projects, word processing, testing, among other activities. The self-contained ESL 
classes have used the computers to access interactive audio files for the ESL literature textbook. The school uses Skedula. com, 
an online gradebook that gives teachers, students, and parents access to student academic progress, homework assignments, 
and daily student attendance. It also allows for email correspondence between parents and teachers. This has helped ELLs be 
more accountable for keeping track of their progress in their classes.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support for our Spanish-speaking population is offered during free-periods by the Foreign Language 
department. Spanish-English glossaries are provided to ELLs for use during their content area classes. ELLs are encouraged to 
use one another to translate concepts difficult to grasp in English. Spanish-language independent reading books are made 
available to students in the Spanish classroom library, with many popular young adult fiction titles translated from English into 
Spanish. Spanish language magazines are also available. The school has two Spanish-English bilingual guidance counselors to 
provide services to students and families whose first language is not English. The LAP team has begun discussion to prepare for 
a time when the school has ELLs whose native language is not Spanish. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All support services and resources we make available to our ELLs are designed for students between the ages of 14-19 and in 
grades 6-12. We make sure to provide services that are developmentally appropriate for our students.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The school has concentrated on incorporating current technologies into classrooms for student use. SMART Boards are 
available in 95% of all classrooms.  Teachers have received ongoing training on its use during in-house professional 
development. This has enabled students to interact with lesson plans teachers have created incorporating the internet, i.e., 
planet earth, Smithsonian and skedula, etc. There are several computer carts available for classroom use, as well as a 
computer lab. These are used for research projects, word processing, testing, among other activities. The self-contained ESL

and daily student attendance. It also allows for email correspondence between parents and teachers. This has helped ELLs be 
more accountable for keeping track of their progress in their classes.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The school conducts an open house for eighth and fifth grade students interested in attending our school. The ESL teacher and 
parent coordinator are present at the open house to answer questions ELLs and their families may have about what type of 
programming is available. At the beginning of the summer before they start 9th grade, incoming students are required to 
attend a school orientation that takes students and their families through a mock student schedule, acquainting students and 
families with what it will be like to attend the school. The ESL teacher and parent coordinator are also present at this event.

and math curriculum. ELLs are especially targeted in recruiting for this program. The summer band and orchestra familiarize 
students with the music program at our school before the fall semester begins. The LAP team has begun discussing ideas to 
recruit more ELLs to the summer bridge program. New ELLs who enroll throughout the year are paired with ELLs who are 
familiar with the school. These students help new ELLs navigate the school. New ELLs also meet regularly with their guidance 
counselor who keeps track of their integration into the school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The language classes available at our school are Spanish, French and Chinese, from beginning-level to Advanced Placement 
Spanish Language. The upperclassmen ELLs at our school are all encouraged to take the AP course. There are currently 2 
former ELLs taking the AP Spanish Language course.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All ELL personnel at our school receive professional development in strategies to support English language learners, with a 
focus on providing scaffolds and adjusting instruction to address language needs and promote reading, writing, speaking, and 
listening skills. These sessions take place on a weekly basis throughout the year and include the following topics: 
  
- Scaffolding Reading of Complex Texts for English Language Learners 
- Building Academic Vocabulary  
- Engaging and Supporting English Language Learners in Classroom Discussion 
- Using Student Self-Assessment and Rubrics 
- Planning Lessons that Integrate Universal Design for Learning Principles 
- Supporting English Language Learners in Meeting Common Core Standards in Literacy 
- Designing Lessons Implementing Achieve3000 
- Using Castle Learning to Support Regents Readiness 
- Using Student Data to Inform Instructional Adjustments that Address the Needs of English Language Learners 
  
Professional development is facilitated by the administrative team, instructional lead teachers, and a consultant from Affinity, 
and other ESL specialists from the DOE. Professional learning sessions take place during daily common planning time. Teachers 
work with facilitators in small groups, determined by department, as well as areas of need identified through analysis of 
observation data.  
We offer curriculum development PD sessions focusing on implementing the CCLS into all classes, including ENL standalone 
classes as well as Integrated ENL classes.  The activities will include planning using the Universal Design for Learning to provide 
students with multiple entry points and differentiated activities and assessments, in order to better meet the ENL student 
needs.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Medgar supports ENL staff to assist students as they transition from middle to high school by providing them time to test each 
individual student, and use this assessment data to guide their instruction for each student.    
ENL teachers will receive ELL-specific professional develpoment through city-wide and CUNY-led PD sessions, as well as 
through coaching.  All staff will receive 4 professional development sessions on ELL-specifics.  For all staff, the assistant 
principal will keep agenda and attendance records, and for ENL teachers, the teacher herself will keep all information in 
regards to the professional development session.      
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences, the ENL teacher sets up individual parent meetings as "check-ins" 
throughout the year.  At these meetings, the NYSESLAT is discussed, as well as the students progress in both his or her ENL 
class as well as their core subject area classes. The schools parent coordinator, as well as both guidance counselor's, act as a 
translator during any school meeting with parents.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We continue to see strong parental involvement in our School Leadership Team (SLT) meetings and Parent-Teacher 
Association. The school Messenger System is helpful in making mass phone calls home about upcoming school events and 
student absences. As a result of the online grading system Jupitergrades.com, communication about student academic 
progress between the school and parents has improved. Many parents are logging on and we have an increase in parent phone 
calls to the school following up on their student’s progress. The two Spanish-English bilingual guidance counselors have also 
improved contact with parents of ELLs. We are now able to increase the amount of communication between the school and 
this parent population. Parents are invited to chaperone school field trips and attend student concerts at the end of each 
semester. There is an annual International Day potluck that brings many students' families to the school. 
The parent coordinaor acts as the point-person for all communication between parents and the school.  She is bi-lingual, and 
speaks both spanish and english.  Therefore, the parent coordinator acts as a translator during any communication between 
the parents and the school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael A. Wiltshire, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
