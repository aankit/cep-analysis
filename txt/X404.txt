Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The School For Excellence will develop in all students strong intellectual and critical thinking skills in literacy, social 
studies, mathematics, and science in order to inform a strong sense of social responsibility . Through our multicultural 
curriculum that integrates the creative arts within the instruction of academic courses, students' perceptions will be 
extended beyond their immediate circles to encompass a broader world-view. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our school is located in the Morrisania region of the South Bronx. This community could be described as the 
cornucopia of American music. It has been the birthright of Jazz, Latin Jazz, Salsa and Hip Hop. According to the latest 
US Census in 2010, it is also the poorest congressional district in the United States This level of poverty can create 
social and economic challenges that undermine the stability of families and individuals who live in the neighborhoods.  

 

The Morris High School building is land-marked because of its outstanding architecture and the fact that it was the 
first co- educational High School in the Bronx. The School For Excellence was one of the first two schools that 
pioneered the wave of small schools and we are located in the Morris High School Campus where that movement 
began. Since then we have consistently remained a school in "Good Standing" according to the New York State 
Department of Education. 

 

According to the ATS RATH report 15% of our student population is living in temporary housing and approximately 1/3 
of them are living in shelters. Of our current enrollment, 26% of our students are Special Ed., 30% are English 
Language learners, and 5% are SIFE students. Many of our students are the first to earn high school diplomas in their 
families, let alone attend post secondary institutions. Some of the more reputable colleges our students have 
attended are Swathmore, Columbia, Skidmore College, Hunter College, Seton Hall, SUNY Albany, Morehouse College, 
Saint Thomas Aquinas, NYC Technical College, Lehman, and Baruch College. Since its inception in 2005, the School For 
Excellence has been able to match or exceed the graduation percentages of schools in our peer index. 

 

Our school’s focus is to integrate literacy, the arts, and technology into classroom instruction. It is our believe that 
literacy is the cornerstone of all high school success and our literacy initiatives include specific school-wide strategies 
that are adopted in every classroom. We adopted the 7 Habits of a Good Reader and the SFE Methods of Annotation 
as a school wide reading methodology which is implemented across the grades and subjects. All Departments 
incorporate research based literacy strategies to support the needs of ENL students, students with special needs, and 
students who read and write below grade level. In addition, our school purchased educational software that supports 
the needs of struggling readers such as Read 180 and this year we are training teachers in the Wilson Reading System. 
Our school also adopted the Writing Revolution/ Hochman writing methodology in order to support the writing needs 
of all of our students. This year we are focusing in the development of mathematical literacy and the use of the IXL 
Math program to align testing with the CCLS standards and ensure that the math assessments inform instructional 
practice. We are also partnering with the College Access Inquiry Institute to support our students' needs in the area of 
college and career readiness and the Elevate program that focuses on cultivating strong study skills and habits across 
all disciplines and grades. 

 

Strong Family - Community Ties 

Our parent coordinator and administration meets with the SLT monthly and outreach to parents is made through 
grade teams. We have expanded the number of open parents night per year from 2 to 4. On parents' nights, the 
school gives parents access to the Skedula Pupil Path program, which allows parents to monitor their children's 
grades and progress in all classes. Our attendance team meets weekly and reaches out to students with chronic 
absenteeism and their parents. The team makes home visits for students with persistent chronic absenteeism. . We 
have adopted an open school policy, where parents are welcome to come in without appointments or special 
permission. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

Some examples of our ties to the local community would be our partnership with Bronx Museum, and the 
Commission of Human Rights. Through our on campus Montefiore clinic students become part of a health 
committee, and parents of these students go to Albany yearly to support bills that relate to student health. This work 
is further supported through our yearly visit from a local Dietician that addresses the parent association. Other issues 
that involve the work of our Parent Association in conjunction with school security and the NYPD is gang awareness. 
Furthermore, parents are involved in restorative practices when their children are involved in a conflict. Despite our 
efforts, maintaining strong parental involvement has remained a challenge for our school. 

 

Supportive Environment 

Last year the school hired a social worker in addition to the school's 3 guidance counselors in order to meet our 
students' socio-emotional and behavioral needs. Guidance workers and the social worker work closely with our deans 
to identify students that exhibit at risk behaviors. Guidance counselor the social worker and deans work one on one 
with students and their parents/ guardians in setting up individual, behavioral goals for students. Also addressing at 
risk behaviors are the CBO Alchemy, which focuses on working with at risk female students. We also are running Boys 
Advisory and Girls Advisory classes daily that consist of our most at risk students.  

We have a peer mediation program that currently consists of 17 certified peer mediators, with 25 students currently 
in training towards certification. Last year we conducted over 53 peer mediation sessions. This marked a 10% decline 
in mediations from the previous school year. We also witnessed a reduction in suspensions. Our ability to reduce 
suspensions, increase the number of certified peer mediators (thus reducing the number of physical conflicts) and 
our ability to address the behavioral needs of our at risk students through our partnerships and Advisory programs 
are a strength for the school. 

 

Rigorous Instruction 

The year regularly administers the PSAT's to Juniors and Sophomores and this year will participate in the district's SAT 
day in April. We are also offering an AP US History class to Seniors and will expand this to AP ELA and AP Global 
classes next year. The school partners with College Now, which gives students the opportunity to earn college credit 
for classes offered at Hostos College after school. This year we are also continuing our partnership with the CUNY/ 
LINCT program through our offering of a CUNY/ LINCT ELA class. This year we are also expanding the Writing 
Revolution program that addresses writing skills across the curriculum to grade 11 and partnering with the Elevate 
program to address our students' study skills and habits through the implementation fo specific strategies across the 
curriculum and grades. At the beginning of each year students are given diagnostic tests in each subject to identify 
areas of strength and weakness, and each semester students participate in Mock Regents and Midterm tests. 
Additionally, students take SRI tests that track Lexile scores. Interventions are administered to ELL students and 
SWD's and these may take the form of additionally programmed classes that focus on literacy skills, the use of 
educational software such as Read 180 or Rosetta Stone, or after school and Saturday classes. 2014-15 School Quality 
Snapshot reported the school as Fair in this area and it is our hope that through the expansion of our intervention 
services, and through our partnerships with the Writing Revolution and Elevate we will improve in this area. 

 

Collaborative Teaching 

Teachers at the School For Excellence meet monthly as a full staff, and weekly in both Department and Grade teams. 
The school has adopted a protocol for sharing best practices and examining student work at these meetings. Likewise

the school has adopted specific instructional strategies that are implemented uniformly and across the curriculum. 
These are use of Writing Revolution strategies, annotation, and the 7 Habits of a Good Reader. Teachers also engage 
in planning interdisciplinary projects. Teachers share and analyze the resulting student work that is generated by the 
implementation of these strategies. This is an area of strength for the school and was given a "Good" rating in the 
2014-15 Snapshot.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

According to NYC DOE statistics, 90% of our students come to us with test scores of Level 1 or Level 2 on NYCDOE 8th 
grade ELA and Math assessments. In other words, they are already reading below level, or far- below level by the time 
they get here. According to the ATS RATH report, 15% of our student population is living in temporary housing and 
approximately 1/3 of them are living in shelters. Of our current enrollment for the upcoming 207-18 school year, 26% 
of our students are Special Ed., 30% are English Language learners, and 5% are SIFE students. Due to these numbers, 
instruction is appropriately scaffolded for different learner levels and teachers periodically run inquiry cycles to 
determine the most effective differentiation strategies to meet our students' needs.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Strengths And Needs As They Relate To The Framework For Great Schools 

Effective School Leadership: One key area of focus for our school is to improve literacy of our students. Our SRI Lexile 
tests indicate 80% of our population reads below grade level. As per the Framework For Great schools, the school's 
administration, in conjunction with our instructional team oversees the implementation of literacy interventions and 
strategies that are implemented across the curriculum. School leadership holds teachers accountable for 
implementation through observations/ evaluations. This is an area of strength for the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 Data on the 2016-17 QR, and 2016-17 PPO shows the school as "Developing" in 1.1 and 1.2. According to the 2016 
School performance dashboard the school was 2 percentage points below city average for the CC Algebra test. This 
past school year, Math teachers led an inquiry into the efficacy of the Meaningful Math curriculum and Think Through 
Math software; analysis indicated that both programs had no impact on student performance on diagnostic tests. 

Strengths: Math Regents scores have improved over the last 3 years. In 2017 we had a 7% increase form 2016 in 
students scoring 65% or above. 48% of our special ed. students scored 65% or above compared to %24 from the 
previous year. 

This year the Math department began using the IXL software program and did preliminary inquiry work to judge its 
effectiveness. 

Needs: School is still below city average score for the Math Regents and needs to meet or exceed city average. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

As a result of the Math department using the IXL Math program's Diagnostic tools as a an area for department inquiry , 
the average score for all students taking the Algebra 1 CC Regents will increase from 65% to above 70% by the end of 
June 2019, , as measured by the June 2018 Algebra 1 Common Core Regents.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: Last year the school partnered with the College Access For All program and was successful in administering 
the PSAT and SAT tests, administering a career survey to all students, and holding a Career Day with guest speakers 
for 9th graders. The school also partnered with the Elevate program that held workshops in classes that focused on 
study skills. 

 

Priority Needs: SY 2016-17 School snap shot data reports that the school is weak in supporting students college and 
career readiness skills. Only 4% successfully completed approved college and career preparatory courses and only 
23%, graduated college ready. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Through the school's increase of AP classes from one to three for SY 2018-19, and our partnerships with College 
Access For All and AP For All, the number of students successfully completing approved college or career preparatory 
courses and exams will increase from 4% to 8% as measured by the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Data shows: 

90% of our entering student population score at level 1 or 2 on 8th grade ELA assessments. 

In house SRI testing indicates that 80% of all students read below proficiency for their grade level 

Data analysis of Regents assessments indicates that students struggle with the written portion of the Regents exams 
they take across all subject areas (ELA, Global, US History, Liv. Env.).  

The 2016-17 QR rating for Pedagogy was Developing for 1.1 Curriculum and 1.2 Pedagogy. Though teacher practices 
are becoming aligned through the use of consistent strategies, there is an "inconsistent provision of multiple entry 
points into the curricula" leading to "uneven engagement". 

 

Data Analysis of History Regents (Global and US) show students struggle on these tests due to poor performance on 
thematic and DBQ essays. School performance dashboard indicates that average score on Global Regents is below city 
and borough and "approaching target" in the 2015-16 school quality guide. 

 

Strengths: The school has a literacy plan that is implemented across the curriculum. ELA and S.S department ran 
inquiry teams leading to scaffolded Writing Revolution outlines and straegies for CC Regents writing tasks. These were 
adjusted to different learner levels and modified for ENL and SWD's. 

Last year the students scoring 80% or better on the ELA CC Regents was 28% as compared to 16% in 2016. 

Special ed. students scoring 65% or better went from 38% in 2016 to 50% in 2017. In 2016 0% of SWD's scored 80% 
and above while in 2017 23% scored an 80% or better. 

 

Teachers successfully collaborated to implement the Writing Revolution program in the 11th grade last SY and the 9th 
grade the previous year 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

 

Need: For teachers to collaborate across the curriculum and across grade teams in the implementation of Writing 
Revolution strategies in order to improve student performance on written portions of state assessments 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

Through the implementation of Writing Revolution strategies prescribed at monthly PD sessions, students' performance 
on the written sections of the June 2019 Global History Regents (Thematic and DBQ essays) will increase by an overall 
student average of one performance level on the scoring rubric.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: During the second semester of 2017-18 SY school leadership identified the need for a vocabulary initiative. 
Teachers began to focus on various vocabulary strategies and reviewed these in a staff wide PD and during 
department meetings. 

 

Needs: 2017-18 Regents scores, SRI tests, baseline diagnostics and department's Data Analysis of these assessments 
show that students' lack of vocabulary hinders student achievement. 

 

2016-17 Spring PPO rating for 1.2 was developing: "Further support students who have IEP's, or your ENL students 
who may struggle with the language and literacy components for each content area...It is important that ICT teachers 
get training and on going support round co-planning and co-teaching models to ensure they plan optimal lessons 
together and seamlessly provide instruction in a manner where both teachers are seen leads in the classroom." 

 

1.1 from QR was developing: Curricula reflected limited use of language supports for ELL's and students with 
disabilities. Thus students have reduced opportunities to engage in rigorous tasks that emphasize critical thinking. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

Through the prioritization of teaching vocabulary as an instructional focus area, where teachers will participate in 3 
school-wide professional development workshops and receive feedback from class observations, there will be an 
increase in the passing rate of the June 2019 ELA, Living Environment, Global, US History and Algebra 1 Regents scores 
by 3%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths:  

This past year the school used the Kinvolve program that is an computer program and a smart phone application that 
allows all staff to send text messages and email to parents/ guardians of any student. 

In 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot there was an increase of 4% from last School Quality Snapshot (79% to 83%) that 
had a positive response (matching 83% citywide) to survey questions regarding Strong Family Community Ties. 

Needs: According to 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot the school fell below the borough average of 84% that 
answered the survey positively. 

The school was rated "Fair" for Strong Family Community Ties according to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot. 

On average, only 10% of parents attend open school nights and less than this for Saturday open houses. 

 

QR rating for 3.4 was "Developing", stating "parents reported they had limited opportunities or were not aware of 
opportunities to participate in workshops offering strategies to support their children on a path to college and career 
readiness" despite the fact that workshops were held regularly and correspondence sent. 

 

School needs to have a better system for communicating to parents. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

By June, 2019, all teaching staff, Guidance, administration and Parent Coordinator will use the Skedula IO Classroom 
messenger to outreach to at least 4 parents/ guardians a week regarding students' attendance, academics, behavior and 
school events, increasing the percentage of parents responding positively to questions regarding "Strong family - 
Community Ties" from 83% to over 85%, thereby exceeding the city and borough averages as indicated in the 2016-17 
School Quality Snapshot.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
New and untenured teachers are supported by state-required mentoring, professional development to meet required 
new teacher PD hours for state licensing, and our connections and programs affiliated with local college and 
universities (so they can earn required credits for certification). Veteran teachers are offered leadership opportunities 
and programs to support their continued growth within the school, and have a voice in school leadership through 
school-wide positions and as part of the SLT team. All staff will participate in ongoing Professional Development 
activities both within and outside of the school building. Some of these professional development activities will be 
facilitated by our lead teachers, model teachers ,Assistant Principal of Instruction and outside providers such as The 
Writing Revolution. 

 

Although Teachers have been recruited through NYCDOE Open Market, many of our recent hires come from 
recommendations we are given by staff from our school, staff and administration from Morris campus, and from the 
regional District Office.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

Besides teachers being engaged in on site professional development during staff, department and grade team 
meetings, teachers are trained off site at various PD’s: 

BFSC PD's on Vocabulary strategies 

CCS: Teachers have attended Bronx BFSC PD for ELA Collections (CCS curriculum) 

Math teachers have been trained for Think Through Math and Meaningful Math/ It's About Time

We have 3 teachers in the Model Teacher program that assist in providing PD's (turn keying Elevate strategies) and 
work with administration in scheduloing and developing protocols for teacher inter-visitations.  

 

PD is differentiated by reviewing teacher evaluations and finding areas of weakness/ need according to Danielson 
components. Teachers strong in particular components of the Danielson rubric work with administration to provide 
differentiated PD to teachers weak in the same components at designated staff meetings. Areas of need are also 
pinpointed/ discussed with teachers when they establish teacher goals at the start of each school year.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
During grade team, department and instructional meetings teacher teams work in collaboration with administration 
reviewing the following: 

- Teachers in each department have collaborated to create diagnostic tests for each core subject and these ar 
submitted for approval by administration 

- IXL Math program assesses students' progress in each Math unit 

- Teachers in each department collaborate to create mid term tests that mirror questions posed on State Regents 
Assessments and these are submitted for approval by administration 

- Teachers create Mock Regents exams from questions on previously adminstered Regents tests 

- Teachers share types of exit slips/ formative assessment strategies at grade and department meetings 

- Adminsitration oversees data analysis of diagnostic tests, mid term via Skedula of Regents tests, Mock Regents 
exams, mid-terms and subject specific diagnostic tests to monitor student mastery of the CCS 

- Writing Revolution writing assessments are adminstered at the beginning and end of each schoo year 

- ELA department reviews results of SRI (reading Lexile) tests that are administered at the beginning and end of each 
school year - results are disseminated to students using a specific protocol 

- analysis of student work resulting from a variety of exit tickets (which are implemented each lesson and across the 
curriculum) ,during department meetings, including those that employ Writing Revolution strategies 

- Teacher teams in collaboration with administration use above data to determine student weaknesses and strengths 
in mastery of the CCS and effectiveness of implemented assessment strategy. Teachers and admin. explore which 
instructional strategies can best address student weaknesses. Teacher input is valued in this process. 

- Departments run Inquiry Cycles to assess appropriate differentiation strategies for different learner levels and SWD's 
and ENL's. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 09X404, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 
The School For Excellence will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  

 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 
Each session will contain 1 class taught by one teacher. 
 
3 teachers are certified ENL teachers, one teacher is a Foreign Language teacher. 
 
All ENL students in this program are Entering/ Emerging. 
 
Instruction: Direct instruction and flexible groupings. Team teaching when 2nd teacher is 
available. 
 
Program notification is sent by mail and Kinvolve text messaging informing parents of program.

ENL department conducts Data analysis in regularly scheduled ENL department meetings. Data 
sources include students performance on content class diagnostics,  Writing Revolution 
diagnostics, Mock Regents, mid terms, student formative assessments. The ENL department 
identifies areas of student weakness by looking at assessment data and student work resulting 
from school adopted ENL strategies (Q-Tell, Kinsella Academic Toolkit) These strategies are 
adjusted and implemented in after school sessions. Findings from data analysis is relayed to all 
content area teachers that have ENL students during grade team and department meetings.

We plan to use the full allocation given to us to carry out the Title III initiatives. The funds 
allotted to our school this year was $13,390. We are expected to receive a small amount of 
additional funds later in the year to support language translation. It is usually less than $2,000 
that we will receive to pay per session for someone to do translation.

Throughout the school year, the ENL teachers attend ENL related professional development 
sessions.  Content area teachers are also encouraged to attend professional development that will 
support their instruction of ENL's in their classrooms. 
 
PD's regarding differentiation for ENL's will be held for the entire staff during 3 faculty 
meetings, 1 hour and 20 minutes each (a Monday in December, one in February, and one in 
April).

All 3 teachers in the program each attend 2 PD's per semester that deal with ENL strategies. 
These PD's are offered through the UFT or district. PD's deal with differentiating for ELL's, and 
ENL specific strategies.  
 
This year the school is working with an instructional coach from BFSC to provide additional PD 
for teachers of this program. 
 
Teachers attending PD's must submit PD agendas and attendance must be verified by school 
secretary. 
 
Per session is paid to teachers attending PD's outside of school hours. 
     
Attendees of PD's share turn key information/ strategies to staff at grade team, department and 
faculty meetings. 
 
 
Monthly, the ENL teacher meets with content area teachers after school to discuss research based 
strategies that can be implemented in all content area classrooms.  Such strategies include 
scaffolding techniques, differentiated instruction, testing accommodations, ENL/ELA common 
core learning standards and performance indicators, academic language for ELL's, and 
differentiated instruction for ELLs in the content area.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The SRI in Read 180 for English. Students also take a Writing Revolution writing diagnostic.To measure their Spanish literacy 
our native language teachers of those students evaluate a writing assessment designed to measure the students literacy skills. 
In addition those ELLs who have an IEP have been tested through their annuals. The data tells us that many are below reading 
level (3rd or 4th grade) in their own language. We have trained our teachers in Writing Revolution, Q-tell, and 
Kinesella Academic Vocabulary Toolkit.   This year we are training a teacher in the Wilson reading program to work with our 
lowest performing ENL students, 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

SRI reading tests determine student Lexile levels and Writing Revolution writing assessments are administered at the 
beginning and end of each school year. New admits take the NYSITELL.  ENL teachers and administration review data in data 
analysis meetings, SIFE students are identified and ENL students are programmed according to compliance rules as indicated 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

by their testing levels in NYSITELL. The data is also used to determine which students will be taking additional after school and 
Saturday tutoring sessions. The school has a bank of tested differentiation strategies to implement, and teachers have been 
trained kn Writing Revolution, Q-Tell, and Kinsella's Academic Vocabulary toolkit.  Teacher teams also run inquiry cycles to 
determine effective differentiation and teaching strategies for ENL students. This year the school is training a teacher in Wilson 
reading program to work with our lowest performing ENL students . 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments include the NYSELAT, ELA, Global History, US History and Living Environment exams. The ENL 
department use the DDC data analysis capability of the Skedula program to run item and error analysis to perform an in depth 
data analysis of these summative assessments.  Students' strengths and weaknesses are determined. Additionally, 
teachers implement diagnostic tests at the beginning of each year to determine baseline performance and identify areas of 
need. SRI scores, and Writing Revolution diagnostic tests also serve as baseline diagnostic teats and are given at the beginning 
and end of each year. These scores are used to track student progress and identify additional areas of need.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students are programmed appropriately such that each level of ENL's get required hours. Inquiry teams run inquiry cycles on 
strategies and instructional tasks to determine appropriate differentiation strategies and scaffolds to implement for 
different levels of ENL students. All ENL students have access to Rosetta Stone and those that need extra support are 
programmed for after school and Saturday ENL tutoring sessions. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We are not k - 5. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT, Regents exams , SRI Reading Level tests, teacher baseline tests and Writing Revolution writing diagnostcs all 
provide relevant data. Students are programmed according to their NYSESLAT scores.  
RLAT Report indicated the following: 
3 Entering/ 20 Emerging/ 20 Transitioning/ 37 Expanding 
 
Entering, Emerging students struggle to pass all Regents exams. Students in need of Regents exams are programmed to take 
Regents prep classes. Typically these students need to take the exams several times before they are capable of passing. 
Likewise these students are programmed for after school and Saturday school classes. 
 
All newcomer ELL's are programmed to take our after school and Saturday tutoring classes. Regents prep is also offered to 
these students on Saturdays. 
 
Newcomer ELL's, Special Ed. Ell's also need extra supports as mentioned above to pass Regents exams. 
 
All ENL students are programmed for required hours as indicated by their levels (Entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding) 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
ENL team meetings refer to the EDAT, Regents scores and NYSESLAT scores and disseminate findings in teacher team 
meetings, grade teams meetings, department meetings, and Guidance meetings where data is reviewed in order to  indicate 
students that need additional supports.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1. We have an ENL instructional program that uses a variety of approaches - push-in, pull out, and self-contained ENL 
classes. All ENL students are programmed to be in compliance with CR PART 154 and are programmed to meet the 
required number of hours in accordance to their ENL designations according to testing. Therefore these students are 
integrated into general education with a push in ENL teacher  and receive stand alone ENL classes. The main 
component of our program is collaborative team teaching that occurs between content area teachers and the ENL 
teachers. Both teachers plan are given planning time daily and during after school meeting times. and together they 
consider the special needs of ENL students in mind and implement the lesson cooperatively according to accepted 
and appropriate team teaching ENL collaborative teaching models. 
 
Students receive hours of instruction to be in compliance with CR Part 154. Within core classes, team teachers may 
use the alternate team teaching model where ENL students are pulled aside to work on differentiated instruction. 
However, as much as possible, these students are also integrated and grouped with the general ed students during 
instruction. 
 
In the stand alone ENL classes, the students are programmed according to proficiency levels. When possible entering 
and emerging ENL students are programmed together for these classes, as are transitioning and expanding. At times 
there is differentiation occurring in these classes as well. For example, although transitioning and expanding students 
may be programmed together in the same ENL stand alone class, instruction is differentiated for each group.

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

       Currently the school is hiring 2 additional ENL teachers in order to be in compliance. ENL students receive required 
minutes with push in teachers and in stand alone ENL classes. There is a period 9 class for additional ENL stand alone classes. 
There also Saturday classes for ENL students.  Students are programmed in STARS according to mandated hours they need to 
receive. Integrated ENL minutes are provided in the following content areas: ELA, History and Math. 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The ENL and content teachers plan together to ensure that ENL methodologies are infused throughout the curriculum; this 
includes scaffolding techniques, strategies to make academic literacy explicit throughout the content areas, as well as infusing 
language functions and structures into lesson plans. In the ELA class, all instruction is in English. In addition, all written 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

products of students are expected to be in English and students are encouraged to speak only in English. Of course, 
appropriate sheltering techniques based on QTEL are used in these classes. However, if with all of this support a student is 
really struggling to express him or herself, translation assistance by another student or the teacher are provided. The goal is to 
challenge students to practice their English while allowing them to feel as if they can express themselves and feel as if their 
native culture and language are respected.   For the beginners, the ENL teachers use the following resources to develop a 
curriculum: Writing Revolution strategies (Hochman method) scaffolded for different learner levels), SFE ENL Differentiation 
strategies, SFE Methods of Annotation, 7 Habits of a Good Reader, Kinsella's Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, Q-Tel strategies, 
Rosetta Stone software and Study Guide books, Continental's New York ELL's, the Northstar series, Reading Explorer series, 
English in Action series, Basic English Grammar, and Focus on Grammar. Math students use the IXL Math software program. 
This coming year our ENL teacher is being certified to implement the Wilson Reading System. These systems are incorporated 
in all classes with ENL students integrated into  ELA, Math and History classes that students need to take according to 
compliance rules. Push in ENL teachers to these classes ensure that students have access to the above mentioned 
interventions in order to assist them with meeting NYS Learning Standards. 
  
 
    
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students take the Spanish LAB when they arrive. In stand alone ENL classes, home language abilities are assessed by the ENL 
teacher in that class. Last year, one third of our students identified as Entering are SIFE students who are illiterate in both 
English and their home language. 
 
         
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  After a student is identified as SIFE, we schedule ENL teachers to provide three periods a week for homework help during 
and content assistance. This is in addition to the self contained ENL classes they are programmed for in STARS. These are 
provided 3 days a week after school. Additionally, students are asked to come in for Saturday school sessions. These extra 
classes are used to help students understand the content and keep up with the work of their core content classes.  ENL 
teachers interact with content teachers to see which students need the most help in various subjects. This year we are 
training a teacher in the Wilson program to work with these students. 
  
b.   For newcomers (who are usually beginners) we place the student in an ELL stand alone class and in core classes there is an 
ENL teacher that provides support in content classes and instructional differentiation.  Additionally, they are also programmed 
for the above mentioned after school classes and offered Saturday school.  Finally, they are given a self-contained ENL class , 
after school classes and Saturday school classes. This year we are training a teacher in the Wilson program to work wit these 
students. 
  
c.  For students who have been ENLs from four to six years, we use the model to provide support in core classes, and, 
depending on skill level, assign the student to a self-contained ENL class. 
  
d. .  In order to meet the needs of LTEs at SFE, we have implemented an ENL instructional program with ENL teachers  that 
push-in to classes and stand alone ENL classes.   
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

e. The progress of former ENL  students is monitored through the summative and formative assessments previously discussed. 
Teachers of these students are made aware of their status and accommodations and differentiation strategies are 
implemented accordingly as needed. 
 
Former ELL's s get testing accommodations, such as extended time, for up to 2 years. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Read 180, Rosetta Stone, Q-Tell strategies, Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, Writing Revolution strategies, annotation, 7 Habits of 
a Good Reader, Wilson Reading System are also programs and intervention system we use to support these students. ELL-
SWD's have a self contained class in 9th grade in addition to the stand alone ENL class. All ENL and Special Education push in 
teachers plan with co-teachers in core subject areas and develop differentiation strategies to assist these students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students with this status receive IEP accomodations and are programmed according to required number of ENL hours. 
Students who have tested out of ENL and are deemed proficient by the NYSESLAT continue to be programmed as part of the 
ELL blocks and receive ENL support in a Collaborative Team Teaching approach.   All of our ENL-SWD are evaluated by both the 
ENL and SPED teachers in the building.  f the certified teachers decide that the student's ENL needs are greater tan their special 
education needs then the student is given an ENL program fit to their proficiency with an elective that provides them with 
special education services.  If the student's special education needs are greater than their ELL needs then the reverse is true; 
the students are given a special education program fit to their needs and receives a freestanding ENL class as an elective to 
service the student's ENL needs. 
  
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELA: Writing Revolution, SFE Methods of Annotation, 7 habits if a Good Reader, SFE differentiation strategies, after school 
classes, Saturday classes, Rosetta Stone, Wilson Reading System 
Math: IXL Math program 
These are provided with translations when necessary. For example, the SFE Methods of Annotation and the 7 Habits are 
available in translated versions. IXL Math is currently upgrading their software to include Spanish translations. 
Beyond regular classes, these programs are implemented in the after school and Saturday school classes. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
The school has hired 2 new ENL teachers and is currently certifying one of these teachers in Wilson Reading System. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We never had a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ENL's are given the same access to after school programs and activities as non ENL students. Information regarding these 
programs is translated and delivered by ENL teachers and other staff members. 
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

Writing Revolution strategies (Hochman method) scaffolded for different learner levels), SFE ENL Differentiation 
strategies, SFE Methods of Annotation, 7 Habits of a Good Reader, Kinsella's Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, Q-Tel strategies, 
Rosetta Stone software and Study Guide books, Continental's Grammarly, New York ELL's, the Northstar series, Reading 
Explorer series, English in Action series, Basic English Grammar, and Focus on Grammar. This coming year our ENL teacher is 
being certified to implement the Wilson Reading System. 
 
Rosetta Stone in an interactive program that assists students with acquiring reading, speaking and listening skills. Our 
students  also use Grammarly for writing skills. This program identifies writing errors and gives feedback and suggestions for 
improving writing. 
 
All our class rooms have interactive smart boards that students can write on and on which text and visuals can be displayed. 
Teachers use these to display graphics and visuals to help ELL students with reading, writing, and speaking. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Th LAB-R  assesses home language. ENL teachers assess home language in class through testing and conversation. One 
differentiation strategy implemented often is translated texts. Students ability to understand these texts help teachers 
determine students' home language levels. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Regular review of student ENL status and student programming are regularly reviewed to ensure compliance.  Each grade level 
has stand alone, self contained ENL classes. Often these self contained ENL classes are a combination of 9th and 10th graders 
or 11th and 12th graders. ENL students are programmed into core classes offered in their grade level. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Principals' weekly meetings coordinate inter-school activities and shared programs. There is an  International school on 
campus. Teachers share instructional materials when necessary. Any professional development that is offered at either school 
is open to teachers from either school to attend. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Correspondence to home regarding resources, Rosetta Stone is accessible to students and parents at all the time.  New admits 
are given access to the Rosetta Stone program. Throughout the year the school hosts open house Saturdays that specifically 
targets the ENL population. Parents are welcome come to the school to learn the details regarding ENL programming, 
resources, and ENL accommodations their children are scheduled to receive.  Lenny Perez the parent coordinator runs an 
orientation session before the school year starts that is open to all new admits. Additionally, he meets with the parents of ENL 
students to discuss entitlement services. All parents are invited to all SLT meetings where all programs, services and 
interventions are disclosed. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 Spanish us offered as a foreign language class to fulfill graduation requirements. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

This school does no have a Dual Language program (we are an ENL program school). 
 

 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
One of our ENL teachers is being certified on the Wilson Reading System this year.  BFSC offers PD targeted to teachers of ENL 
students that teachers attend throughout the year. PD also occurs during Department and   Staff meetings. SFE keeps a 
running list of differentiation strategies, these are shared with the staff at these meetings and can be referenced on the 
SFE Teaching Strategies Google Document that is being continually updated and shared with staff. Each semester an in house 
PD is offered during faculty meeting that is led by one of our ENL teachers. These PD's usually focus on differentiation 
strategies for different levels of ELL's. Monthly the school has department meetings that focus on the use of Writing 
Revolution strategies. ENL teachers, inquiry teams and administration work together to differentiate these strategies to 
different ENL levels. Another PD topic is Team Teaching. These PD's focus on how teacher teams that are comprised of content 
area teachers and ENL teachers can work effectively together in the planning and implementation of instruction. All records of 
PD, such as attendance, agendas, and supporting materials are kept by the assistant principal. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
With our monthly staff meetings and monthly Writing Revolution meetings the school easily meets the 15% requirement for all 
teachers. ENL teachers receive additional hours through the PD's offered by BFSC and the UFT. Agendas are kept by the school 
secretary and secretary tracks the number of hours that are  required. ENL teachers regularly provide PD on differentiation 
during staff meetings and in weekly department and weekly grade team meetings. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At the beginning of each year the Parent Coordinator meets with the parents of all ELL's and provides information regarding all 
entitlement services, chancellor regulations and school programs that concern ELL students.  This parent orientation meeting 
provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program model offered in NYC; the parent video describing the three 
programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask questions so that they are informed 
about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided throughout the meeting by our bilingual Parent 
Coordinator. school has an open door policy and all parents are invited to attend the monthly SLT meetings. Additionally, once 
a month, the school hosts an open house on Saturdays where parents of ENL student are invited to learn more about our ENL 
programs and services. Parents are given access to Rosetta Stone and this year we plan to offer the parents English lessons. 
Teachers meet with parents of ELL students during the 4 parent teacher conferences held each semester. Teachers provide 
specific information regarding students to their parents such as the students' progress and additional supports that can be 
accessed outside of school. 
We have several bilingual staff members in addition to our bilingual parent coordinator. We ensure that these staff 
members  are available during the open school night/ parent teacher conferences and Saturday open houses. 
Parent Coordinator keeps records such as attendance/ sign in sheets and agendas.

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Overall, parental involvement at our school is a struggle. During the 4 open school parent teacher conferences only  a small 
fraction of the parents of ENL students attend. Likewise, few parents attend the initial orientation meeting for parents of ENL 
students, the  monthly Saturday open houses or the SLT meetings. For this reason, the school purchased Kinvolve, which 
allows any member of school staff to communicate with parents via text messaging in various languages. Staff's regular  usage 
of Kinvolve will be an expectation and it is our hope that we can increase parent attendance at orientations, Saturday open 
houses, and parent teacher -conferences. All materials are translated into home languages and there is bi-lingual staff 
available at ll the above mentioned sessions. We hope to attract more parents of ELL students to the Saturday open houses 
this year by offering English language lessons, Salsa dance lessons and Pot Luck lunches. All agendas and attendance 
records are maintained by the parent coordinator.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jeffrey Houston, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

An inventory of the different languages spoken at student's homes is taken. These surveys should be 

completed by freshmen and any other new students to the school. The HLIS is conducted by the Parent 
coordinator and/ or Guidance counselor upon admittance. Parents and students are asked to provide home 
language and preferred language. The parent coordinator cross references with the ATS RAPL. Parent coordinator 
will then determine if the parents need language assistance. The PC then compiles a list of all the language 
translations needed. 

Emergency cards are kept on file in the main office with the language information.
