Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Ditmas I.S. 62, one of eight middle schools in District 20, is located in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. This school 
has 1211 students who come from approximately 38 different countries and create a diverse student body. 

The Sheltered Instructional Observation Protocol (SIOP) teaching model has been implemented and perfected over 
the past seven years, and closely aligns with the 22 competencies of the Danielson's Framework. We have a 
partnership with the Flatbush Development Corporation. They provide an after school program for 150 students, 
Monday through Friday from 3 TO 5 p.m. They provide the following programs: varsity basketball, mixed media arts, 
homework, JV basketball, football, cooking, dance, soccer, robotics. yoga, and leadership. Under our New York State 
Extended Day-School Violence Prevention Grant we have after school and Saturday programs in Lego robotics, 
Software Engineering, Ditmas News Network, the Science of Exercise, Crocheting, Cheer leading, and a self-esteem, 
self-advocacy, self-confidence programs for female students called "Beautiful Me." As a part of these grant , we have 
teamed with the following CBOs: Global Language, Keys to Abundant Like and Creative Connections. These CBOs 
provide after school and Saturday programs in Culinary and Teen Entrepreneur as well as professional development 
to the staff.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student population is 51.47% male and 48.52% female, 21.83% African-American, 31.03 % Hispanic, 31.69 % 
Asian and 13.46% White. Recent immigrants account for about 17 % of our enrollment, coming from Uzbekistan, 
Pakistan, and Mexico. We have forty-three (43) children that are identified as Students with Interrupted Formal 
Education (SIFE), giving us approximately 24 % of our population as English Language Learners. Students with 
disabilities account for 16.58 % of the student body. Out of the 199 special education students, sixty(60) of them are 
ELL’s. While some students come from middle class backgrounds, 79.3% qualify for free lunch giving the school Title I 
status. Year to date attendance is 95.6 %. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Due to changes in the 2015-2016 grades 3-8 ELA and Math exams, the proficiency rates from exams prior to the 2015-
2016 are not directly comparable to the 2015-16 proficiency rates.

number of students in Level 2 by 40% and increased the number of students in levels 3 and 4 by 40%. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

8 th grade - Statistics show that we have reduced the number of students in Level 1 by 65% and increased the number 
of students in Level 2 by 23% and increased the number of students in levels 3 and 4 by 43%. 

Mathematics 

6 th grade - Statistics show that we have reduced the number of students in Level 1 by 13% and increased the number

Strengths noted in our most recent quality review: 

1. The majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations. 

2. Teacher teams consistently analyze assessment data and student work for students they share. 

3. Across classroom teaching practices are aligned to the curricula, reflect an articulated set of beliefs, and 
consistently provide students with multiple entry points to the curriculum. 

4. School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and integrate 
the instructional shifts. 

5. Curricula and academic tasks are planned and refined using data and student work. 

6. Teachers use common assessments to determine student progress towards goals. 

7. Across classrooms assessment practices reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding. 

8. School leaders consistently communicate high expectations and provide training to the entire staff. 

9. School leaders and staff provide ongoing feedback to families regarding their children's progress toward goals. 

Additional Strengths: 

1. The principal purposefully aligns teacher programs and assignments to ensure strategic collaboration between 
teachers; 

2. The school has three deans, three guidance counselors and three family workers. These staffs are highly visible 
throughout the building and are involved in all aspects of the school community, thus supporting the emotional and 
social growth for children while offering anti-bullying programs, high school application support and daily academic 
interventions; 

3. The principal strategically decided to create a block schedule for the 6 th and 7 th grade; 

4. The school offers a number of activities to communicate to students and families expectations about college and 
career readiness, and students’ independence via their interests and abilities.

5. The Ditmas News Network (DNN), and the Student Council provide students the opportunity to exercise their 
judgement and work independently on topics of interest. This results in an opportunity for students to develop and 
present their research studies to the school community, and video news cast on current issues using their editorial 
skills. Additional courses are integrated into the instructional program to provide advanced curriculum for students 
who meet academic criteria. In this program, students are able to take advanced placement classes in science and 
math. In addition, all students have the opportunity to use the Software Engineering Program ( SEP) to develop 
computer programming skills,  

7. Feedback to teachers is documented and leads to interim goal setting and improved student outcomes.  

8. Professional development is purposeful and is based on the trends observed across teaching practice.  

Challenges 

● There are a significant number of immigrant students that arrive at Ditmas with inconsistent formal education many 
of which are illiterate in their home language; the majority of our incoming immigrant students are at the entering 
level; 

● The lack of teaching strategies across the classrooms prevents all learners from engaging in meaningful learning and 
discussions thus hindering students ability to develop higher order thinking skills; 

● There is a need to increase the use of rigor in all classrooms; 

● Assessment data is not consistently used across classrooms to inform effective revisions to lessons with the purpose 
of improving identified learning gaps; 

● Due to the implementation of the New York State Part 154 regulations, there are many additional challenges in 
terms of time and staff.  

Key Areas of Focus 

● In English Language Arts we plan to target the white population. The majority of our white population are ELL’s 
coming from Uzbekistan, and Arab speaking countries. To address the needs of this population, we use Scholastic 
CodeX, National Geographic Inside Series, Pearson my Perspectives, and Scholastic 3-D. We must target our ELA Level 
1 Students in our after school program. Additionally, we have added Imagine Learning which is an engaging language 
and literacy software program that accelerates English learning. It is focused on oral language, academic vocabulary, 
instruction in the five essential components of reading and strategic first-language support.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In reviewing our proficiency levels in ELA, we have found that our 6th grade increased by 10%; 7th grade increased by 
13% and our 8th grade increased by 15%. Our 6th grade ELL students increased by 2%; our 7th grade ELL students 
increased by 2% but our 8th grade ELL students decreased by 2 %. Our Students with Disabilities did not show any 
increase. The 6th grade was flat, the 7th grade decreased by 14% and the 8th grade decreased by 6%.We believe that 
our general ed population increased due to the fact that there was an extended time limit on the test. The additional 
time had no effect on the SWD students. The 6th and 7th grade ELLs increased where the 8th grade decreased, 

In reviewing or proficiency levels in Math, we have found that our 6th grade increased by 6%; the 7th grade increased 
by 2 % and the 8th grade increased by 6%. Our ELL Math students declined. The 6th grade by 3%; the 7th grade by 2% 
and the 8th grade by 4%. Out Math SWD students have remained flat. There are no proficient students in the 6th, 7th 
and 8th grade. 

According to the Framework for Great Schools Report 2016, we have exceeded the Citywide Average in Common Core 
Shifts in Literacy (4.14%); Common Core Shifts in Math (4.50%); Course Clarity (3.15%) and Quality of Student 
Discussion (3.85%). 

Based upon the most recent Quality Review, we have scored Proficient in the following areas: 

1.1 How interesting and challenging is the curriculum? 

1.2 How effective is the teaching and learning? 

2.2 How well does the school assess what students are learning? 

School Strengths : 

● 95 % of our teachers use multiple forms of student achievement data to improve instructional decisions; 

● 91 % of our teachers provide students with the social and emotional skills needed to succeed in and be prepared for 
their next grade level; 

● 88 % of teachers use assessments that are relevant to my daily instruction; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

● 94 % of teachers work together on teams to improve their instructional practice; 

● 95 % of teachers set appropriately high expectations for student work in their class. 

Priority Needs:  

● Increase teacher planning time for all academic departments, vertically and horizontally, aligning curriculum in 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) 

Increase the number of Math periods for 6th, 7th and 8th graders. 

 
  Provide an intensive ELA and Math program for our ELLs and SWD students. 

● Increase professional development opportunities on a variety of instructional strategies. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June, 2019, we will increase the number of instructional periods of English Language Arts and Math for all self-
contained Students with Disabilities.  

By June, 2019, all teachers will refine the curriculum maps to properly align each lesson to the Common Core Learning 
Standards, including scaffolds and modifications as instructional tools for differentiation, thus meeting the needs of all 
learners. 

By June, 2019, we hope that the DOE will increase the band width capacity. We have made this request . 

By June, 2019, all teachers will have participated in our professional development program that was developed by the 
UFT PD Committee. This program will address the needs of our ELL and special needs populations.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
At Ditmas, we believe that student growth and success is dependent upon the strong partnership between home and 
school. Due to this, we have adopted an open door policy. Parents are informed at the beginning of the year and 
reminded throughout the yeqr that they are always welcome to come to the building. An appointment is never 
necessary to see the administration or a teacher. We are planning to have a series of Family Engagement Afternoons 
to address the following subject areas of Literacy, Math, Science and Social Studies. Translators will be present. Our 
experience with our parents indicates they want to help their children in school and they want to understand what is 
expected of their children. Through NY CARES and at no cost to Ditmas, they will be providing an adult ESL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

Many of our parents have a need to improve their English language abilities. This will help or parents have greater 
access to communicating within the community and school. Our parent coordinator and our guidance counselors will 
engage families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction.

Ditmas IS 62 has high expectations for all of our students. Teachers, students and parents know that all staff and 
students work to their highest potential. Our academic programs are standards based, differentiated and accessible to 
all students. There are systems in place that help students who are struggling academically, socially and emotionally. 
Our guidance counselors see mandated students but all students are aware that our three guidance counselors are 
always available. 

Based on the Framework for Great School Report: 

88% of our students had positive responses to questions on rigorous instruction (higher than the NYC average). 

85% of our students had positive responses to questions on collaborative teachers (higher than NYC average). 

79% of our students had positive response rate for Supportive Environment (higher than the NYC average) 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By April, 2019, students identified as At-Risk will have improved in English Language Arts and Mathematics by 5% as 
determined by grades on report cards.

At Ditmas, we believe that student growth and success is dependent upon the strong partnership between home and 
school. Due to this, we have adopted an open door policy. Parents are informed at the beginning of the year and 
reminded throughout the yeqr that they are always welcome to come to the building. An appointment is never 
necessary to see the administration or a teacher. We are planning to have a series of Family Engagement Afternoons 
to address the following subject areas of Literacy, Math, Science and Social Studies. Translators will be present. Our 
experience with our parents indicates they want to help their children in school and they want to understand what is 
expected of their children. Through NY CARES and at no cost to Ditmas, they will be providing aan adult ESL program. 
Many of our parents have a need to improve their English language abilities. This will help or parents have greater 
access to communicating within the community and school. Our parent coordinator and our guidance counselors will 
engage families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction.  

In addition, parents are encouraged to: 

1.  Attend the Parent Orientation Meeting in September, the Parent/Teacher Conferences in November and 

March and Family Night in May where translators are available if needed. 

2.  Attend Parent/Teacher Association Meeting to be better informed and to receive information that will benefit 

their child.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the Framework for Great Schools Report, we have exceeded the Citywide Average in all areas: Inclusive Leadership 
(3.29%), Teacher Influence (3.72%), Program Coherence (4.12%), Instructional Leadership (3.77%).  

Teachers feel supported by the principal and assistant principals. Teachers understand the need for targeted 
professional development and they understand that they must be reflective practitioners and constantly reassess 
their lessons for effectiveness; changing them as needed but always maintaining high standards. 

While the majority of teachers understand how to create a rigorous differentiated lesson, not all teachers are at the 
highest level of their profession. The 2015-2016 Quality Review states that there is a lack of coherence and strategic 
implementation of teaching strategies across the vast majority of classrooms limits all students from being engaged 
and demonstrating higher-order thinking. 

Many of our teachers want to be considered Highly Effective. We plan to continue our turn key professional 
development during the school year based on the needs of the teachers. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the administration will have given constructive, timely feedback to each teacher with the opportunity to 
be considered Highly Effective based on Danielso's Framework for Teaching.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Ditmas I. S. 62, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

 

Ditmas I. S. 62 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

n developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent-Teacher Association and Title I 
Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC)

Ditmas has previously used Title III funds to supplement student instruction in math, science and 
ELA. Because of student need, we have adjusted supplemental student instruction to be in ENL, 
ELA and Math.  According to the 2016-2017 New York State School Report Card, (the latest 
report card that is available ) of our Limited English Proficient Students only 38 % are 
considered proficient in math.  Only 4% of our English Language Learners who took the New 
York State ELA exam demonstrated proficiency in ELA.  Due to the low level of proficiency in 
ELA and Math, we believe it is important to offer programs to increase proficiency in these 
areas.  Our students made fared better on the NYSESLAT with 9% of students in 6th grade, 21% 
in 7th grade and 31% in 8th grade reaching the Commanding level.  In addition, 46 % of students 
in 6th grade, 54% of students in 7th grade and 40 % of students in 8th grade scored at the 
Expanding level.  We believe our use of Title III, and Title I SEP funds have supported our past 
efforts and we would like the opportunity to continue and expand this work in FY 19.    
1.  Provide a morning ELA program for Newcomer ELL students who will be taking the NYS 
ELA test for the first time. 
The ELA "Do Your Best on the Test Morning Academy"  will run for 58 sessions beginning on 
December 4, 2018 through March 29, 2019 from 7:15 to 8:00 AM.  The program will target 
approximately 40 Newcomer ELLs that were admitted to the New York City Public Schools 
after April 30, 2018.  These 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students will be taking the New York State 
Common Core ELA exam for the first time in April 2019.  The regular school day does not 
provide for enough time to prepare these students for the New York State Common Core exam in 
ELA. It is necessary that we provide these students with supplemental services in a morning 
program.  The intensive program will be taught by two (2) highly qualified ESOL teachers.The 
Language of instruction is English.  We will purchase supplementary consumable educational 
materials that focus on NYS ELA test such as Continental Get Set for Reading New York.  Get 
Set for Reading Common Core prepares students for end-of-year Common Core 
assessments.  Each book is centered on the text types identified by the CCSS at grade level and 
tests students using item types found on CCSS assessments. In addition, we will purchase 
licenses from IXL.  IXL is an immersive K-12 learning experience that provides comprehensive, 
standards-aligned content for math, language arts, and science.  At no cost to the Title 
III Program, the program will be supervised by the ENL/ELA  Assistant Principal who is funded 
by Title I SWP funds. 
2.  Provide an after school ENL "Welcome Class" program for our students who have been in the 
country for less than one year. 
The Saturday "Welcome Class" Intensive ENL Program will run for 18 three hour sessions on 
Saturdays (9:00-12:00) from December  2, 2018 to April 13, 2019.  This program will target 40 
newcomer 6th, 7th and 8th grade students who entered the country in 2018.  .  CR154 has 
reduced the number of periods of standalone ENL which does not leave enough time in the 
school day to meet the language development needs of these students.  This program is designed 
to meet  the needs of newly arrived, non-English speaking immigrant students.  Many of these

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
students have entered our school with little to no English language.  The language of instruction 
is English.  The program will be taught by two (2) highly qualified ESOL teachers in a reduced 
class size setting of up to twenty students. The students will  be instructed using ENL 
methodologies and strategies.  The program is inter-disciplinary, student-centered, and lends 
itself to mixed ability grouping.  The following skills will be taught:  sight vocabulary, phonics, 
reading, writing, listening, speaking, as well as an interdisciplinary introduction to the core 
academic areas of English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies and  Science.  We will 
purchase supplementary consumable materials such as Vocabulary Links and Attasnio & 
Associates, "Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT."  Vocabulary Links for English Language 
Development is  designed for ELLs and other students who need to strengthen their vocabulary 
skills.  Workbooks reinforce knowledge of grade-level content words in science and social 
studies.  Motivating activities and reviews expose students to target words multiple times and 
address WIDA's ELD Standards and state standards based on the Common Core.  Getting Ready 
for the NYSESLAT is fully aligned to the Common core Learning Standards and the Bilingual 
Common Core Progressions.  It includes practice at all five Performance Development 
Levels:  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding.  It includes broad-
based themes that integrate, Listening, Reading and Writing. At no cost to the Title III Program, 
the program will be supervised by the ENL/ELA Assistant Principal who is funded by Title I 
SWP funds. 
 3.  Provide an after school NYSESLAT Writing program.  This program will target 40 
transitioning and advanced ELLs and will run for 19 sessions on Thursdays beginning December 
6, 2018 through April 18, 2019 from 2:20 to 4:20.  An analysis of NYSESLAT scores and 
student writing indicates that many of our higher level ELLs are having difficulty producing 
authentic high-quality writing.  The regular school day does not provide enough time to prepare 
these students for the type of writing expected on the NYSESLAT.  It is necessary that we 
provide these students with supplementary services in an after school program.  This intensive 
program will be taught by two highly qualified teachers certified in ESOL  The language of 
instruction is English.  As CR 154 changed how students receive ENL, we have a writing 
program that we purchased that is not being used, so at no cost to the Title III grant, we will 
utilize the National Geographic Inside Writing Program and the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, 
which we already have in our book rooms.  The National Geographic Inside Writing offers in-
depth writing instruction including model study, writing traits, and writing strategies at three 
(3) academic levels. The Academic Vocabulary Toolkit is designed to help students master high-
use words for academic achievement.  It prepares students to become agile communicators in the 
Common Core State Standards era, and expand understanding of new words with embedded 
grammar and syntax targets.  Word-to-word bilingual dictionaries (ie google translate) and 
student made language glossaries will all provide home language support for students. 
4.  Provide an after school Math academy for Newcomer ELLs. 
This program will  run for 33 sessions on Wednesday and Friday from 2:20 to 3:50 PM from 
December 5, 2018 through April 17, 2019.  This program will target 30 Newcomer ELLs in the 
6th, 7th, and 8th grade who will be taking the New York State Common Core Math exam in May 
2018.  The regular school day does not provide enough time to prepare these students for 
the New York State Common Core exam in Math.  It is necessary that we provide these students 
with supplementary services in an after school program.  This intensive program will  be taught 
by two (2) highly qualified teachers certified in ESL and Math.  The language of instruction is 
English.  We will purchase supplementary consumable Math materials such as NY Progress 
Math.  Common Core Progress Mathematics is a supplemental program covers 100% of the 
Common Core and addresses our core curriculum gaps.  It deepens students' understanding of 
math using the Gradual Release of responsibility model, multiple representations, and real world 
problems.  It provides opportunities for collaborative learning and builds a deeper understanding 
of the coherence of the standards.  In addition, students will use IXL Math.  This program sets a

Begin description here:            
 Our teachers are afforded many opportunities to participate in professional development.  Most 
teachers have been trained in SIOP, and continue to attend workshops offered by the office of 
English Language Learners and the New York State Education Department.  Ditmas coaches, 
staff developers and assistant principals conduct weekly 80 minute professional development 
sessions to prepare our teachers with tools to help the LEP student. Additionally, teachers are 
invited to attend district as well as city conferences and workshops that pertain to their subject 
area and to the ELL student’s particular learning needs.  These trainings are turn-keyed to 
appropriate staff. 
 
1.  At no cost to the Title III grant, we have adopted  SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observation 
Protocol).  The cost of implementation is through our Title I SWP funds.  The SIOP Model is a 
research-based and validated instructional model that has proven effective in addressing the 
academic needs of English learners that Ditmas has adopted as part of its universal design for 
instruction.  The SIOP Model consists of eight interrelated components:  lesson preparation, 
building background, comprehensible input, strategies, interaction, practice/application, lesson 
delivery, and review & assessment.  Using instructional strategies connected to each of these 
components, teachers are able to design and deliver lessons that address the academic and 
linguistic needs of English learners.  Title III teachers who are not SIOP trained will be trained in 
the SIOP model beginning on the Chancellor's Conference Day by the school's Mentor teachers, 
Ms. Olivene McIntosh and Ms. Akira Osbourne, a NYS certified highly qualified 
teachers.  There will be three  training sessions of 45 minutes each beginning September 
2018.  These training will occur once monthly on Mondays.  This PD will have a positive impact 
on our ELLs because it creates a universal design for instruction for all classes.  All teachers will 
use the same format and language to express lesson objectives.  All teachers will have a 
vocabulary and language access focus to the lessons.  Copies of agendas and sign-in sheets are 
maintained in a binder in the main office and the office of the ELL Coordinator. Teachers will 
participate in ELL PDs/workshops through C.I.T.E. 
 
2.  Ditmas implemented the Scholastic English 3D program in 2013 with a small group of 
students.  As part of our Title III program, we will offer an English 3D after school program for 
our Long Term ELLs.  English 3D ensures all students are on a path towards college and career 
readiness through teaching high-leverage, portable academic language, engaging students with 
rigorous, increasingly complex informational texts, improving speaking andf listening skills 
through daily opportunities for accountable class discussions, and developing academic writing 
skills in summarizing, justification, argument, and research.  In addition, Dr. Kate Kinsella 
developed this program specifically for use with Long Term ELLs.  As part of this program, 
professional development  will be provided to the teacher using this program and others who find 
it of interest on the program's instructional strategies and implementation.  Prior to 
implementation, the teacher will visit the following website for a two hour training webinar: 
http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/edservicesondemand/video.asp?video=5.  Training will be 
provided at no cost to the Title III program.  There will  be four training sessions of 45 minutes 
each beginning in November on Mondays.  Training will  be provided by the ELL Coordinator, a

highly qualified NYS certified ESOL teacher.  The ELL Coordinator attended multiple training 
sessions provided by Ms. Kinsella, the programs author, and used the program over several 
years.  This training will  benefit ELLs because it is an English language acceleration program 
that will provide intensive remediation in the areas of academic vocabulary, academic reading, 
academic speaking and academic writing.  Copies of agendas and sign-in sheets are maintained 
in a binder in the main office and the office of the ELL Coordinator. 
3. At no cost to Title III funds, we have purchased professional development sessions from 
CITE.  The focus is ENL strategies and implementation of these strategies in the classroom and 
Title III programs.  CITE PDs qualify for CTLE credit and are taught by professionals from their 
partner college.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
  
At Ditmas, we believe that student growth and success is dependent upon the strong partnership 
between home and school.  Due to this we have adopted an open door policy.  Parents are 
informed at the beginning of the year and reminded throughout the year that they are always 
welcome to come to the building.  An appointment is never necessary to see administration or a 
teacher. 
1.  We are planning to have a series of Family Engagement Afternoons to address the following 
subject areas:  Literacy, Math, and Science.  Translators were present.  Our experience with our 
parents indicates they want to help their children in school and they want to understand what is 
expected of their children.  Parents of ELLs will participate in a workshop designed to help their 
child with the Common Core Curriculum in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science.  These 
workshops will be held by the following Assistant Principals: Michelle Buitrago (ELA); Beatrix 
Bortle (Math);  Marielena Santiago (Social Studies); Gina Lynch (Science). Parents will be 
notified of these activities through a translated invitation sent home as well as a phone message 
through our automated telephone system.  There will  be four sessions of one hour each.  These 
sessions will occur once a month on Mondayss beginning in November. Copies of agendas and 
sign-in sheets are maintained in a binder in the main office and the office of the ELL 
Coordinator. 
2.  Title III College and Career Readiness.  Translators will be present.  As so many of our 
parents are new to New York City, they are unaware of what is expected to be college and career 
ready.  We will use the Achieve NYC guides as a source of information.  As part of these 
afternoons, we plan to highlight the connection between academic preparedness and college and 
career readiness.  Parents of ELLs will participate in a workshop designed to increase  and 
ensure that parents understand the pathways to college and career and are able to begin planning 
for their child's future.  Parent will be notified of these activities through a translated invitation 
sent home as well as a phone message through our automated telephone system.  These sessions 
will  be facilitated by our three guidance counselors.  All three are NYS certified Guidance 
Counselors.  There will be three sessions of one hour each on Mondays.  These sessions will 
occur once monthly beginning in December 2018. Copies of agendas and sign-in sheets are 
maintained in a binder in the main office and the office of the ELL Coordinator  
3.  As part of our Title III grant, we plan to have a family celebration.  Translators will be 
present.  While it is important to understand learning expectations, it is also important to 
celebrate learning outcomes.  All students who are part of the Title III program and their parents 
will be asked to bring in a dish from their culture to share and will be encouraged to dress in the 
clothes of their home country as part of this celebration of family and learning.  Students will 
create presentations that demonstrate the learning that occurred during their time in the 
program.  These will be on display at the celebration.  Parents of students in our Title III program 
will be notified of these activities through a translated invitation sent home as well as a phone 
message through our automated telephone system.  This celebration will occur in May and will 
be facilitated by our ELL coordinator, Ms. Toni Ann Hammel.  She is a highly qualified ESOL 
teacher.  Copies of agendas and sign-in sheets are maintained in a binder in the main office and 
the office of the ELL Coordinator  
4.  Through NY CARES and at no cost to Title III, Ditmas will be providing an adult ESL 
program.  Many of our parents have a need to improve their English language abilities.  This will 
help our parents have greater access to communicating within the community and at school, 
allowing them to help their children reach academic success.  Parents will be notified of these 
activities through a translated invitation sent home as well as a phone message through our 
automated telephone system.  These sessions will be facilitated by the community organization, 
NY Cares.  Sessions are two hours long and occur weekly on Saturdays.  Sessions begin in

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
- National Geographic Inside Placement Test.  This is an assessment that is part of the Inside series.  As an  assessment it is 
used to help level students within a class.  The phonics component of the test helps to identify students in need of early 
literacy skill instruction. 
 
- Code X.  Code X has been adopted for use with the adoption of the Common Core Curriculum.  In the upcoming school year it 
will be used in grades 7 and 8 and in some grade 6 classes.  Students are systematically and explicitly assessed throughout 
Code X to ensure they are mastering the key instructional shifts of the Common Core.  Code X includes three types of

demonstrate comprehension of text, vocabulary, and measure mastery of key Common Core State Standards. 
 
-Pearson myPerspectives:  MyPerspectives is being used in grade 6 with potential to be adopted in upper grade if deemed 
successful.  The ELA program includes beginning, mid-year and end-year tests.  When taken online, remediation is 
automatically assigned.  In addition, selection tests and unit tests monitor mastery of the ELA/Literacy skills and standards 
taught in each selection, and assess all skills and standards taught within the unit. 
 
-Imagine Learning is a computer based individualized intervention program that we have adopted beginning the 2017-2018 
school year.  It includes beginning to end-of-year growth data, features for monitoring oral fluency and written responses, 
Instant intervention groups with resources as well as Common Core and ELD alignments for teacher-led remediation. 
 
- The BRIGANCE CIBS II is used as a screener for our long-term and developing ELLs who may be experiencing difficulty.   The 
criterion-referenced CIBS II includes both a Reading/ELA Inventory and a Mathematics Inventory. The CIBS II Reading/English 
Language Arts (ELA) Inventory includes reading and writing assessments that correlate to commonly tested reading and ELA 
skills and strategies that reflect state and national standards.  The CIBS II Mathematics Inventory is based on NCTM focal 
points, which align to state standards.  Results from the Brigance  CIBS II produces grade equivalents, percentiles, and 
quotients, as well as monitors growth and reports progress.  Teachers use this information to plan necessary remediation. 
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All teachers participate in inquiry teams.  At inquiry meetings teachers discuss and analyze student assessment data and 
determine next steps.  In addition, we have teams comprised of grade content and vertical content to plan units and ensure 
that students are ready for the next grade. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ELL Baseline Assessment is designed to provide teachers with detailed information about their students' strengths and 
needs in English language development and to serve as a resource to help plan individual and group instruction.  Students' 
knowledge of academic English is assessed in all four language  modalities:  listening, reading, writing and speaking. 
 
 Performance Series is Scantron's computer-adaptive diagnostic testing solution that provides educators with instant test 
results, personalized to each student, that ensure correct overall student placement.  Administered over time, these tests 
provide a longitudinal view of student growth in core curriculum areas.  It gives Grade Level Estimates, Performance Band 
Rating, reading Rate and Lexile Measure for Reading.  All which help the teacher choose appropriate materials and individually 
plan for students. 
 
The Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS).  The MLS is a multilingual suite of diagnostics designed to measure the home-
language literacy skills SIFE bring with them when they enter New York City Schools.  This information will be highly 
informative for teachers of SIFE, since students come in with a range of skills in both literacy and math, and knowing each 
individual student's strengths and weaknesses is essential for teachers to plan instruction.  Information from the MLS helps 
determine SIFE placement as well as planning for remediation of missing skills indicated by the native language test. 
 
The Spanish LAB.  The Spanish LAB gives us information about the abilities of our Newcomer Spanish speaking 
students.  Primarily, this data informs us if an individual student has difficulty or strength in their native language. 
 
Progress is measured with the NYSESLAT, the ELL Baseline Assessment, which is given twice per year, teacher given assessment 
and Performance Series. 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

All teachers participate in inquiry teams.  At inquiry meetings teachers discuss and analyze student assessment data and 
determine next steps.  In addition, Administrators monitor data, plan tiered interventions through RTI and reach out to 
parents to build school-to-home partnerships.  In addition, we have implemented an AIS reading pull-out program, which 
targets newcomer ELLs who are demonstrating difficulty with reading.  Students are chosen to participate in the program 
based on NYSESLAT scores and teacher recommendations. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We are a 6 to 8 middle school so this question is not relevant to us. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessments that we use to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are: 
 
-NYSITELL:  The NYSITELL informs us of the actual English abilities of our incoming students.  As of October 2016 we are 
registering students with a wide range of English abilities.  Students come in with no English, with others at the expanding 
level.  Using the raw score data from the NYSITELL allows teachers to understand what areas an individual student may be 
weaker or stronger in.  ENL teachers use this information to group partner and plan lessons at appropriate access points. 
 
-NYSESLAT:  Like the NYSITELL, the NYSESLAT informs us of a student's actual English ability.  Information from the NYSESLAT is 
used to initially group students, plan lessons at the appropriate access point per the New Language Progressions and plan for 
deficits in a particular modality. 
 
-New York State Common Core ELA exams:  These annual tests are designed to measure how well students are mastering the 
learning standards that guide classroom instruction.  Results are reviewed to determine areas of deficit. 
 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

At the end of August of each year, when NYSESLAT results are released, we run the RLAT to see current NYSESLAT scores.  If 
changes to programs are necessary, we try to do it before the school year begins.  Information from the NYS ELA may also 
impact classroom placement.  In addition, the ELL Coordinator runs the EDAT and shares the results with Administration to 
help make decisions regarding class placements, intervention programs and curriculum. 
 
At least once monthly, the ELL Coordinator runs an updated RLAT and RLER to ensure that all students are programmed 
appropriately. 
 
Finally, we have informational and instructional meetings at each grade level, where this information is shared, disseminated 
and discussed. 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 
At this time, we only offer Freestanding English as a New Language.  As per CR Part 154 guidelines, the ELL 
Coordinator tracts the parent option for new admits to ensure that if 15 students of the same level across two 
contiguous grades have the same program interest, we can take steps for opening the program of choice. 
 
Every class at our school is a block class, meaning that they travel together as a group for all subjects.  Information 
from the NYSESLAT is used to initially group students, plan lessons at the appropriate access point per the New 
Language Progressions and plan for deficits in a particular modality.  Students are grouped in classes as per their 
current English language development level based upon the results of the latest NYSITELL or NYSESLAT 
scores.  Entering and Emerging students are placed in homogeneous ELL only classes.  Transitioning, Expanding and 
Commanding students may be placed in an ELL only class or as part of a class with non-ELL General Education 
students.  ELLs with disabilities are placed in classes as per their IEP.  Students receive ENL instruction in accordance 
with CR 154 guidelines.  All Entering and Emerging students receive a minimum of 4 periods weekly of standalone ENL 
and 4 periods of Integrated.  Integrated ENL is co-taught with an ELA (or common branch) certified teacher and an 
ESOL certified teacher.  In a few instances Integrated ENL is taught by a highly qualified, dually-certified ENL/ELA 
teacher.  Transitioning students receive a minimum of 2 periods weekly of Standalone ENL and 2 periods of Integrated 
ENL.  Expanding students receive a minimum of 4 periods weekly of Integrated ENL and Commanding students receive 
a minimum of 2 periods weekly of Integrated ENL.  As per CR 154 guidelines for Expanding and Commanding students, 
Integrated ENL may occur with any Core Content subject, however, we try to program all Integrated ENL with 
ELA.  ICT, SETSS and self contained special education classes will receive services according to the lowest leveled ELL in 
the class.  These classes receive the requisite weekly periods of Integrated ENL.  Pull-out Standalone ENL instruction is 
necessary to service students at the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning levels in these classes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

At this time, we offer Freestanding English as a New Language.  As per CR Part 154 guidelines, the ELL Coordinator 
tracks the parent option for a new admit to insure that if 15 students of the same level across two contiguous grades 
have the same program interest, we can take steps for opening the program of choice. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At this time, we offer Freestanding English as a New Language.  As per CR Part 154 guidelines, the ELL Coordinator 
tracks the parent option for a new admit to insure that if 15 students of the same level across two contiguous grades 
have the same program interest, we can take steps for opening the program of choice. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Each August, the ELL Coordinator runs the RLAT to get current NYSESLAT results.  Students are placed in appropriate classes 
based on the results and adjustments to class programs are made as necessary.  In addition, the ELL Coordinator runs the RLAT 
and RLER monthly to ensure that all ELLs are appropriately placed. 
 
Students are programmed for ENL (standalone and integrated) in accordance with their NYSITELL or NYSESLAT 
scores.  Students who are entering and emerging receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL 
per week.  Students at the transitioning level receive a minimum of 90 minutes of standalone ENL and 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL.  Students at the expanding level receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  Students at the commanding level 
receive 90 minutes weekly of integrated ENL.  Integrated ENL is co-taught with a certified ESOL teacher and a certified ELA (or 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

common branch for 6th grade) teacher at the entering, emerging and transitional levels. All students receive between 5 and 7 
periods of ELA per week (may be in combination with integrated ENL).      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Currently, we only offer English only courses.  However, our students are encouraged to use their native languages as an asset 
in all subject areas.  This may include peer discussion in the student's native language, use of word-to-word dictionaries or 
translation given by a staff member who speaks the language of the student.   
 
All teachers, in every classroom, and every subject area, use the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) to support 
language learning for all of our students.  This ensures that there is continuity throughout the building and that our students 
are afforded high-quality core content instruction while using ELL instructional strategies and methodologies.  In all classes, it 
is expected that there be clear and comprehensible content objectives and language objectives; content concepts appropriate 
for age and educational background level of students; supplementary materials such as graphs, models, and visuals; explicit 
building of necessary background knowledge, an emphasize on key vocabulary; comprehensible input; scaffolding techniques; 
a variety of question types including those that promote higher-order thinking skills; frequent opportunities for interaction and 
discussion between teacher/student and among students; and group configurations that support language and content 
objectives of the lesson. 
 
In addition, through our partner, Power My Learning, many classes have adopted the Blended Instruction Framework.  The 
Blended Instruction Framework for Personalized Learning is a research-based set on instructional practices that, together, 
enable educators to use blended learning to improve academic mastery and ownership of learning among diverse 
learners.  The Blended Instruction Framework for Personalized Learning identifies five key areas if instructional 
practice:  Classroom Environment, Data-Driven Instruction, Student-Driven Learning, Family and Home Connections, and 
Professional Growth.  In blended learning classes, the teacher establishes strong and clear classroom routines and procedures, 
structuring class time to provide students with a balance of different learning experiences, including the integration of digital 
resources and blended learning models. 
 
In order to support these efforts, we have adopted the following programs: 
   
- National Geographic Inside: Inside is designed to increase reading/writing skills and content knowledge with National 
Geographic content paired engaging literature, informational texts and intensive instruction. 
  
- Great Source Access Science:  ACCESS Science offers students clear, standards-based, sheltered instruction in science, while 
building English proficiency.  Features include:  engaging, accessible lessons covering the big ideas in life, earth, and physical 
science; core science instruction designed to support and scaffold different levels of language proficiency; oral language and 
hands-on activities; lessons that complement classroom curriculum and build academic vocabulary; and step-by-step models 
and a highly visual design. 
 
-  Scholastic Common Core Code X is an English Language Arts Curriculum that challenges students to read, think, analyze, 
question, cite evidence, debate, and write every day. Code X was built specifically to address the rigorous demands of the 
Common Core State Standards and to ensure students become deep readers and measured writers who can translate these 
skills into success on the Next Generation Assessments. 
 
- Pearson CMP3 is a Common Core math curriculum that focuses on inquiry-based learning. The program engages students 
while driving conceptual understanding, procedural skill, and real-world applications.   CMP3 aligns to the Common Core State 
Standards and prepares students for college and careers. 
 
-Pearson myPerspectives is currently being trialed in the sixth grade and may be expanded to grades 7 and 8.  myPerspectives 
is an English language arts curriculum for Grades 6 - 12 that values the perspective of the learner, collectively and individually, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

and provides next-gen learning experiences that promote higher achievement and develop the competencies needed for 
college and career readiness.  Interactive learning blends print and technology in a student-centered, teacher-inspired 
classroom.  This program creates an interactive, engaging, and relevant learning environment through readings, meaningful 
activities, and purposeful performance tasks.  myPerspectives encourages social collaboration as well as student ownership of 
learning through goal setting, choice, and reflection. 
 
-Imagine Learning:  Imagine Learning is an engaging language and literacy software program that accelerates English 
learning.  It is focused on oral language, academic vocabulary, instruction in the five essential components of reading, and 
strategic first-language support. 
 
- Connected Mathematics Project 3, or CMP3, is an inquiry-based mathematical program for Grades 6-8.  It helps students 
actively focus on math problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation, and connections.  These math 
practices require students to look deeper and connect problem solving to practical situations. 
 
- English 3D is a powerful English language development program designed to help struggling students accelerate English 
language proficiency and develop the academic language skills they need for success in college and career.  The program builds 
students' competence and confidence through consistent instructional routines for academic vocabulary, discussion, writing 
and more. 
 
-Story Studio is a proven affective arts and English language integration program for elementary, middle and high school 
students.  Through the power of visual arts and storytelling, Story Studio advances literacy development for English Language 
Learners by increasing comprehensive ELA achievement in reading, writing, speaking and listening.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Although we do not have a bilingual or dual language classes, we evaluate the progress of our students through oral 
translations from teachers or paraprofessionals.  Students also utilize word-to-word glossaries and dictionaries.  Students are 
encouraged to respond in native language until they are comfortable using English.   Students are also given the opportunity to 
use translated test booklets on NYS Common Core assessments, when available.  In addition, for students who may be SIFE, we 
administer the LENS in the languages available:  Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Haitian Creole, and Spanish.  
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We are unwavering about differentiating for our ELL subgroups.   We have run comprehensive Title III programs for the past 
ten (10) years.  These programs run extended day and on Saturdays.    Our newcomers are placed in age appropriate Entering 
classes which are equipped with the National Geographic Inside Series.  This series includes textbooks, workbooks, native 
language libraries and other supplemental materials geared at helping our students understand challenging content and think 
critically. 
 
SIFE Students:  As SIFE students are now only at the Entering and Emerging levels these students are placed in ELL only classes 
at their English language development levels. This allows for greater differentiation of their diverse needs.  The emphasis is on 
bridging the gaps for these students to make them college and career ready.  These students use the RIGOR program and 
Imagine Learning, in addition to other curricula materials.  In addition, there is an emphasis on research based projects that 
incorporate all four modalities.   
 
Newcomer students:  The majority of our Newcomer students are at the Entering or Emerging Levels.  These students are 
placed in ELL only classes at their English Language development level.  We purchased National Geographic Inside for use with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

these students, including the phonics kit.  Students who are have difficulty mastering phonics and decoding receive small 
group pull-out instruction using the Just Read, SpellRead or Wilson curricular. These students also access Imagine Learning, 
allowing non-fiction reading and writing delivered at their lexile levels.  All teachers utilize the SIOP model with the emphasis 
on language development necessary for these students to succeed. In addition, via Title III funds, we offer extended day 
programs that focus on taking the NYSESLAT and ELA for the first time and mathematics remediation for our newcomer 
students. 
 
Developing ELLs:  ELLs who have been receiving services for 4-6 years also receive a wide range of support at our school.  The 
majority of the students in this category are at the Transitioning and Expanding level of English Language Development.  Any 
developing students who are still in Entering and Emerging levels are identified and targeted for intensive 
intervention.  Students in the Transitioning and Expanding levels continue to receive instruction from all teachers emulating 
the SIOP model.  This allows for continuity of instruction with the continued supports in language development that these 
students still need.  These students are provided with an array of instructional curricular, aligned with Common Core 
standards, that teachers utilize when designing appropriate instruction.  These include the English 3D program.  This is a 
language acceleration program designed by Kate Kinsella that focused on academic language and evidence based 
argumentative writing.  We also have the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit to use with our Transitioning Students.  Also by Kate 
Kinsella, as the name suggests, this program focuses on increasing understanding of academic vocabulary.    Another resource 
used to improve academic vocabulary and evidence based writing is Word Generation.   These students also get access to 
Imagine Learning, which delivers instruction to students at their current level.  Finally, developing ELLs use both Code X, with 
the appropriate scaffolds, and National Geographic Inside.   
 
Long Term ELLs:  We have several interventions and differentiation methods in place for our long-term ELLs.  The majority of 
these students are at the Expanding level, with some still at the Transitioning level.  Like all of our ELL populations, these 
students are instructed using the SIOP model.  This puts the focus on Language development for all of our students.  The 
English 3D program was brought into Ditmas specifically for this population of student. We expanded it to include other 
populations of ELLs after seeing success with it.  This program provides students with scaffolds needed to access complex texts 
and respond appropriately, using complex language.  It is truly a language acceleration program.   In addition, these students 
also use Imagine Learning and Word Generation as part of their curriculum. These students are also included in Title I and  Title 
III extended day programs to remediate skills needed in reading and math.  This allows for deficits to be addressed in a non-
threatening, small group setting. 
 
Former ELLs:  For the two years following exiting ELL status, our former ELLs continue to receive ELL services.  These students 
also receive instruction via the SIOP model.  The focus being on continuing to build an advanced repertoire of English 
vocabulary.  Students who may be struggling are invited to participate in Title I or Title III programs or pull-out intervention 
services. 
All ELLs and Former ELLs receive testing accommodations of time and 1/2, use of word-to-word glossaries and separate 
location.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our teachers differentiate instruction, utilize the SIOP model, refer to and follow the student's IEP and utilize many 
instructional resources. 
All teachers, in every classroom, and every subject area, use the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) to support 
language learning for all of our students.  This ensures that there is continuity throughout the building and that all students are 
afforded high-quality core content instruction while using ELL instructional strategies and methodologies.  In all classes it is 
expected that there be clear and comprehensible content objectives and language objectives; content concepts appropriate 
for age and educational background level of students; supplementary materials such as graphs, models, and visuals; explicit 
building  of necessary background knowledge, an emphasis on key vocabulary; comprehensible input;  scaffolding techniques; 
a variety of question types including those that promote higher-order thinking skills; frequent opportunities for interaction and 
discussion between teacher/student and among students; and group configurations that support language and content 
objectives of the lesson.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The student's IEP is used as a the guiding resource when making decisions about any SWD including ELLs.  Any student who 
requires a language paraprofessional, receive one.   Classroom placement is determined by the IEP, as such we have ELLS in 
12:1:1, ICT and SETSS classes.  They receive all related services either within the classroom or in a separate location as 
described in their IEP.  As this school only has a Freestanding ENL program, they receive their ELL services in alignment with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

English proficiency levels.  All students receive at least 4 periods of Integrated ENL in their primary classroom.  Students who 
require additional Standalone ENL periods would receive this instruction in their primary classroom if possible.   Some students 
may receive this instruction in a separate location if necessary based upon the composition fo the primary class.  All efforts are 
made to keep students with their primary class.  We are also proactive in moving students in less restrictive environments 
based upon student ability to be successful in that environment.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

Approximately 24% of our students are English Language Learners.  17% of our population are students with disabilities.  About 
33% of our SWDs are also ELLs.  We currently have 67 long term ELLs (26% of our ELL population) and a high number of 
Developing ELLs.  An analysis of the 2016-2017 EDAT revealed several areas of need.  104 out of 269 ELLs remained at the 
same level, while 15 students regressed one proficiency level.  In addition, it is revealed that 62 students scored low in the 
writing modality on the NYSESLAT.  In addition, the number of ELLs performing at Level 1 on the 2015 NYS ELA increased by 
17% and 18% in the 6th and 7th grades, respectively.  We decreased the number of ELLs performing at a Level one by 13%. 
 
Based on the data indicating writing needs, we have adjusted our Title III program to include a NYSESLAT writing program. 
 
To improve our ELA instruction and interventions, we have adopted the following: 
 
- Imagine Learning:  Imagine Learning is an engaging language and literacy software program that accelerates English 
learning. It focuses on oral language, academic vocabulary, instruction in the five essential components of reading, and 
strategic first-language support.  This is a targeted, differentiated intervention program that will deliver individual intervention 
based on areas of need. 
 
- Pearson myPerspectives is currently being trailed in the sixth grade and may be expanded to grades 7 and 8.  myPerspectives 
is an English language arts curriculum for Grades 6 - 12 that values the perspective of the learner, collectively and individually, 
and provides next-gen learning experiences that promote higher achievement and develop the competencies needed for 
college and career readiness.  Interactive learning blends print and technology in a student-centered teacher-inspired 
classroom.  This program creates an interactive, engaging, and relevant learning environment through readings, meaningful 
activities, and purposeful performance tasks.  myPersepectives encourages social collaboration as well as student ownership of 
learning through goal setting, choice, and reflection. 
 
- Through Press-for-Kids, News-O-Matic, an individually leveled daily news site that delivers leveled articles directly to 
students.  Teachers use the articles to deliver content on various levels, build background and assess reading comprehension.    
 
-Imagine Learning Think Through Math for all students at no cost to the Title III program.  Imagine Learning Think through 
Math includes rigorous, standards-rich instruction, based on each student's level of understanding.  It helps build confidence 
and the knowledge needed to move to the next level.  In addition to receiving immediate corrective feedback and instructional 
support, students have access to LIVE, U.S. certified math teachers in real-time, including bilingual teachers to assist students 
in their home language.  Think Through Math motivates students to do mote math with a uniquely 21st century motivation 
system -  a powerful blend of intrinsic and exteinsic motivators including contests, points, avatars and games.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not have a bilingual program this year. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELLs receive the same access to all programs during the school day as our English proficient students and receive all 
courses required by NYS Education law.  Programming currently occurs through the Freestanding ENL model, 
  
Afterschool and supplemental services that are available to our students are extensive.  Through the Title III grant, we provide 
targeted programs in ELA and Math, as well as a program just for first year Newcomers.   ELLS are identified by their area of 
need and invited to participate via a conversation with the teacher and a completed permission slip sent home.  Permission 
slips are in the home language of the parent.  If needed, a follow-up telephone call will also be made utilizing translation 
services as needed.   Our ELLS regularly participate in the supplemental and afterschool programs.  Our supplemental 
programs reach capacity. 
 
Extended Day Programs include: 
 
1.  Title III morning ELA program for Newcomer ELL students who will be taking the NYS ELA test for the first time.  The ELA "Do 
Your Best on the Test Morning Academy" runs for 68 sessions beginning on November 14, 2017 and runs through March 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68

2:20 to 4:20 from December 7, 2017 through April 26, 2018.  This program will target approximately 30 first year ELLs who are 
lacking in basic/elementary math skills. 
 
6.  Title III Afterschool Language Acceleration program for our Long-term ELLs:  Many of our long-term ELLs are strong in 
conversational English.  However, they are lacking in the academic speaking, reading and writing skills needed to be successful 
with the Common Core Curriculum and exit ELL status.  The language Acceleration Program will run for 41 sessions, 
Wednesday and Frida, beginning on November 15, 2017 running through May 4, 2018 from 2:20 - 3:50.  This program will 
target approximately 15 - 20 long-term ELLs in the 6th, 7th, and 8th grades who are in desperate need of advanced English 
literacy skills.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
At Ditmas, we have three computer labs and thirteen lap-top carts.  In addition, we have four ipad carts that were purchased 
with grant money exclusively for our ELL population.  Most of our classrooms also have SmartBoards that allow for interactive 
lessons to be delivered to students.  We have also partnered with Power My Learning to provide 6th grade students with 
computers for use at home.  We have also purchased licenses for Imagine Learning which is differentiated and common core 
aligned.  We also have many Common Core aligned instruction materials available for use with our ELLs.  These 
include:  English 3D, Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, National Geographic Inside, Code X, myPerspectives, and Word 
Generation.  We have purchased word-to-word dictionaries for ELLs as well.  We also have various intervention materials 
available for use with our ELLs.  These include: RIGOR, Just Read, Spell Read, Wilson, National Geographic Phonics, and many 
ELL books.  At this time, Ditmas only has a Freestanding ENL Program.  To support students with in their native language, we 
have purchased word-to-word native language dictionaries, native language literature - English picture dictionaries and bi-
lingual literature.  Imagine Learning  includes native language programming and native language support.  Many teachers have 
also installed apps on their ipads that allow for translations and native language support in their particular subject area. 
 
Ditmas has fully embraced STEM for all students including  our ELLs.  We currently have SEP in 6th and 7th grade with plans to 
expand it 8th grade, which many ELLs participate.  As part of SEP, instructors utilize Computer Science Discoveries.  This is an 
introductory computer science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science 
as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.  Using code.org students first learn to deconstruct 
code.  When they have mastered this skill, students move on to scratch.mit.edu where they learn to construct code.  Students 
also take part in podcasting where they create a technology rap, which is uploaded and shared with their peers.  Students 
maintain a digital portfolio with Google as the platform.  Ditmas News Network (DNN) is our student run news program.  Many 
our our ELLs participate in this program.  Students participating in this program learn to collaboratively write and research a 
news story, direct and video the segment and finally edit and upload the digital report.  Our news stories are available 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

at http://cyber62.weebly.com/dnn.html and several stories have been shared on the DOE website.  Students are taught to use 
Google to create and collaborate on digital documents.  In addition, students who are in our superintendents program (which 
includes ELLs) participate in Lego Robotics, in which they build EV3 robotics and use mindstorm to remotely program their 
robot creations.  Finally, these students use Arduino through Spark Fun Inventors Kits.  They learn to assemble circuit boards 
and program them to do various functions.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language is supported in ENL through our Native language classroom libraries, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries.  We 
also have an extensive bilingual library in our school library as well. In addition,  students are partnered with a home language 
peer to discuss and process complex topics in their home language.  Newcomers and beginners are also encouraged to write 
responses in their home language until they feel secure enough in written English.  Students are always encouraged to use 
their home language as an asset. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The expectation is that all instruction is aligned with the Common Core learning standards with the appropriate scaffolds 
needed for the content to be comprehensible for our ELLs.  All materials purchased from standard instructional and including 
intervention materials are designed for use with middle school students.  This ensures that students struggling with reading 
receive respectable instructional materials that are designed for their age level and interest range.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs and their parents meet with the registration secretary, who provides DOE documents in native languages 
and guides them through the registration documents.  They meet with the ELL Coordinator who explains their program 
options, using interpreters as necessary.  The parent coordinator provides a tour of the building.  In addition, the parent and 
student meet with their corresponding Assistant Principal.  New students are also monitored for progress or difficulty, 
including on an emotional level.  Sessions with the guidance counselor are provided as necessary.  In addition, through our 
immigrant grant, we have provided an afterschool counseling session for newly immigrated students who are experiencing 
difficulty because of the change in their environment.  Newcomer ELLs are also invited to participate in Title III programs for 
ENL and math. 
    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Spanish and French as LOTE at Ditmas IS 62.  Most studdnts receive two periods of LOTE instruction per week in 
either Spanish or French.  Newcomer ELL classes do not receive LOTE.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In consideration of the new CR 154 requirements, our professional development plan is heavily focused on effective co-
teaching models and strategies.   All staff participate in Inquiry Teams via Professional Learning Communities.   Teachers  and 
paras of ELLs form teams to evaluate learning, make plans for interventions and improve on skills. In addition, we send 
regularly send teachers out of the building to participate in professional development opportunities sponsored by the Office of 
ELLs and the Brooklyn South Field Support Center.  These teachers then turnkey their findings to other teachers of ELLS (ESOL 
teachers and content area teachers).  These turnkey trainings are planned for in the short-term, as they are regularly 
announced only a few weeks in advance.  
 
All staff participate in Inquiry Teams.  Teachers of ELLs and paras form teams to evaluate learning, make plans for interventions 
and improve on skills.  Teams meet weekly, per our Superintendent's mandate. 
 
We also offer specific professional development such as: SIOP, Imagine Learning, INSIDE series PDs, Code X, Word Generation 
and turnkey training of Professional Development opportunities offered by the Office of ELLs throughout the year. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our Professional development team meets to plan professional development activities for our teachers, including regular 
participation of a professional learning community-inquiry teams.   As part of inquiry teams, teachers and paras study 
individual students and student outcomes. 
 
In addition, ELL/ELA teams meet once monthly to discuss integrated ELA planning, turn-key instructional strategies and 
develop plans for student interventions. 
 
Finally, other staff members will participate in ELL specific training to occur four times  per year.  These trainings will be 
conducted by the ELL department and will focus on ELL instructional strategies that can be utilized in the content area. 
 
Teachers are informed about this mandate and plan activities to meet the required allotment of hours.  Professional 
development records (agendas and attendance sheets) are kept in a binder in the main office.  Copies of ELL specific PD 
records are also kept in a binder in the office of the ELL coordinator.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
As the DOE has provided 75 minutes per week (on Monday) for parental involvement, our ELL teachers use this time to provide 
annual individual meetings with the parents of their students.  A bilingual staff member or over-the-phone translation services 
will be utilized as needed.  The goal of the program is to inform parents of their child's language development progress as 
evidenced by language proficiency assessment results and share with parent's information about their child's language 
development needs.  Content area teachers are invited to attend to share information about content area specific language 
development needs or will provide specific input to the ESOL teacher to share if they cannot attend.  ESOL teachers will first 
share NYSESLAT results with the parents and provide explanations as to what those results evidence.  In addition, they will 
explain how those results affect the ELL services that the student receives.  They will then explain to parents what the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

 

language development needs of the child of in each content area based on observation, assessment results and input from 
other teachers. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our school utilizes the ILOG feature in ATS.  All parental contact is recorded in each teacher's ILOG books and also in ATS.   
  
Parental involvement has always been a priority at our school.  At the beginning of the school year we hold parent 
orientations.  To ensure that the parents of our ELLs can participate, we  provide direct translations via headsets to our 
parents.  Parents receive information about student programs,  extended day services, meet the teachers and support staff of 
the school and have any questions answered.  In addition, we also have translators present and available at parent-teacher 
conferences.  We never allow language to be a barrier to communication.  
  
Mr. Kevorkian, the Principal, has been in this building for 39 years and he takes parental and community involvement very 
seriously.   Some of his former students are teachers here and many of his former students are the parents of our current 
student population.  Mr. Kevorkian is present at all parent orientations.  He greets all students and parents at admission and 
discusses the needs and responsibilities of the student with the parents.  He also invites them to attend the next PTA meeting.  
  
We also have an active PTA.  They meet monthly to celebrate student work, present community resources and discuss issues 
of concern.  Parents of ELLs sit on PTA committees as well as the School Leadership Team.  We also connect families of ELLs 
with community resources such as the Brooklyn Public Library, New York Cares, Power My Learning and Flatbush 
Development.   
  
Our Parent Coordinator creates a welcoming environment for parents.  She meets all new students and their parents at 
admission.  She assists parents in completing admission forms and gives the parents and child a tour of the school.  She works 
to increase parental involvement by working closely with staff, parents and community organizations.  She convenes regular 
parent teacher meetings and events around topics of key concerns to parents.  In our parent coordinator's office, and our PTA 
resource room, we have a parent library that contains many resources for parents.   
  
This past year, we also held an ELL family night.  Students prepared presentations to share with their families.  Approximately 
30 families attended.   We plan to continue our annual ELL family night in 2018.  In addition we hold family 
workshops/information nights on common core curriculum for ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies and our guidance 
counselors held a high school information meeting for ELL parents to assist parents in choosing a high school and completing 
applications.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Barry Kevorkian, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Written and oral language preference data is collected via the following forms and entered by school staff in ATS: 

1. Student Registration Form – Completed by the school or enrollment office during the point of initial admissions. 

2. Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) – Completed by all parents during the point of initial enrollment. 

3. Emergency Contact Card (Blue Card) – Completed by all parents at the beginning of every school year, upon 
enrollment in a new school, and updated as needed. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

To assess language preferences for both written and oral communication, we regularly download the ATS Adult 
Preferred Language Report (RAPL) report. This data is shared with administrators,teachers and other staff 
members.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In individual student emergencies, we will have a bilingual staff member contact parents. If no bilingual staff member 
is available we will use over-the-phone communication services to contact parents. 

 

In the event of a school emergency, we will use School Messenger which makes robo calls to parents in English, 
Spanish and Russian. We also have School Connext which will provide oral or written translations to LEP Parents. We 
will solicit more parents to sign-up for this service as a means to contact them in case of an emergency. We can also 
utilize bilingual staff members and over-the-phone interpretations as a last resort. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Each September, we will dedicate a Professional Development session to training staff on the goal of the Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663. We will utilize the Language Access Resources Intranet located at 
https://intranet,nycboe.net/School Support/translation and interpretation 
unit/Languagesaccessresources/default.htm. We will view the Video titled T&I unit - Over the phone interpretation.

We will share other resources available on the Language Access Resources Intranet including the documents titled 
Best Practices for Communicating with Immigrant Families, Guidelines for working with Interpreter, Translation and 
Interpretation Unit brochure, the Language Identification Guide, Text to Accompany Documents, and a printout of the 
instructions for accessing over the phone interpretation services and Translation Services. Copies of the agendas for 
these meetings will be stored in a binder in the office of the ELL Coordinator. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

- The welcome poster is posted near the primary entrance to our school. 

 

- We provide all parents with a copy of the Parents’ Bill of Rights. We provide translated versions of the Parents’ Bill of 
Rights that are available at http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights. 

 

- We provide all parents with a copy of the Parents' Guide to Language Access 

 

- There is a Language ID Guide at the security desk and the main office 

 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys are a major mechanism that we use to gather feedback from parents. We have an open door policy 
that allows parents access to administration and teachers, at their convenience. Feedback is often given at this time 
as well. In addition, our parent coordinator is very pro-active with our parents. She is in constant contact with them 
and always gathering feedback. Finally, we have a monthly leadership meeting in which includes a diverse group of 
parents. During our meetings, we explore the services provided and seek improvement where needed.
