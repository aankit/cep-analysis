Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

World View High School mission is to develop a rigorous project-based academic program which will prepare students 
for college, career and exemplary citizenship.  

We designed project-based curriculum where students, including SWDs and ELLs, work with teachers who personalize 
curriculum based on each student’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. We aim to prepare all students to use 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

technology in a thoughtful and purposeful way. We also encourage our students to develop maturity, self-control, 
curiosity, optimism, and tolerance. Students will be immersed in a supportive environment that is nurturing, 
intellectually challenging, and conducive to learning. We strongly believe that all students have the ability to learn 
when they are provided with a welcoming and supportive family oriented environment. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Initiatives 

 

Merit System (Supportive Environment)  

The Merit System is a school-wide initiative that involves the collaboration of teachers, students and parents to 
recognize positive behaviors that will allow students to become productive members of the school community and 
successful leaders. Positive reinforcement and recognition of exemplary citizenship is critical in maintaining a positive 
school culture. The development and implementation of the merit system consist of parent outreach, data tracking, 
maintaining up-to-date and accurate records of merit points (per student), and coordinating celebratory events for 
student recognition. Every teacher is responsible for tracking merit points for each student on a daily basis. Students 
are given merit points for the demonstration of citizenship and respect toward peers and school staff. Students with 
the most points are rewarded and recognized with principal lunches, recognition ceremonies and reward trips (apple 
picking, pumpkin picking, ice skating, roller skating, medieval times and six flags).  

 

Advisory (Supportive Environment) 

The Advisory Department is a diverse team of educational professionals committed to meeting the social-emotional 
and academic needs of each student at World View High School. This committee is comprised of Social Workers, 
Guidance Counselors, College Readiness Specialists, and a Special Education Instructor. Through ongoing 
collaboration, each unit is planned with precision to provide students with the life skills they need to prepare them for 
college and post-secondary endeavors. We recognize that students benefit most from consistency, thus strive to 
maintain the similar lesson-plan format they receive in their core subject classes. Units are designed with a backward 
planning approach; each lesson builds upon the other ultimately leading to a panel discussion at the end of each unit 
(based on the Essential Question posed at the beginning of the unit) to demonstrate their understanding of the 
material presented in class. The instructors will use Bloom’s taxonomy as a guide to leading rich, meaningful, and 
differentiated class discussions that promote higher forms of thinking among all students (including those with 
cognitive disabilities, emotional disabilities, and language barriers). Students will be required to engage in collegial 
style discussions and debates about topics such as Community, Respect for All, and Integrity. Discussion forums align 
with the ELA Common Core standards, which in turn, will support students with the writing process and public 
speaking in other classes. In addition, the collegial-style debates will strengthen students’ skills in crafting valid claims 
supported by evidence, creating solid counter-claims, and writing strong rebuttals. Lessons will also be tailored to the 
meet the needs of seniors who will be provided with immense support throughout the college admissions process; 
they will be given a generous amount of instruction time to apply to multiple colleges and write college essays. Last 
but not least, Advisory will inherit components of the former WVHS mentoring program. Students will create grade 
goals for each of their classes at the beginning of the Fall and Spring Semesters. After each marking period, students 
will reflect on what they did well and what they need to improve in order to reach their semester grade goals.  

 

Peer Advisor, Leadership & Service (PALS) (Supportive Environment)  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

The purpose of the PALs program is to provide support for 9th graders and transfer students in their transition to 
World View High School. The peer mentors are juniors and seniors who have shown an interest in helping others, 
shown leadership skills and are role models in the classrooms both academically and behaviorally. All peer mentors 
are matched with student mentees based off of common interests. This is the inaugural year of the mentor 
program at World View High School.  

AP for All (Rigorous Instruction) 

World View High School has partnered with the AP for All DOE Initiative to ensure that every high school student 
will have access to a range of Advanced Placement (AP) courses. With the AP program now in its third year at 
World View, we will offer a total of six different AP courses.We also offer pre-AP courses to prepare students for 
the rigorous expectations of these college-level courses. By fall 2021, students at all high schools will have access to 
a full slate of at least five AP classes, thereby increasing college and career readiness for all students. 

 

College Now (Rigorous Instruction) 

World View High School is partnered with Lehman College’s College Now Program. College Now is a collaborative 
program between City University of New York (CUNY) and the New York City Department of Education (DOE). It is a 
FREE transition program for qualified NYC public high school students. Through College Now, qualified students get 
an early introduction to the college environment and a jump start on college coursework by taking credit-bearing 
college-level courses; students have the opportunity to earn up to 14 college credits and can start taking College 
Now classes as early as the 10th grade. College Now credits are transferable regardless of where the student 
decides to go to college. This is an experience that helps students further build the academic skills that are 
necessary to be successful in college. 

 

Parent Engagement (Strong Family-Community Ties) 

Family Nights, which are held monthly, look to further engage our school’s families in their child’s education and 
school community. We recognize the importance of parent involvement in our school and are committed to 
maintaining a welcoming and nurturing school environment. During the Student Academic Update portion of our 
Family Nights, parents have the opportunity to individually meet with their child’s teachers and guidance 
counselors to discuss their child’s academic and overall performance as well as, collaborating to ensure their child is 
meeting and exceeding the school’s expectations. 

During the Parent Association portion, an array of different speakers, workshops and activities are held to 
strengthen family ties and parent involvement. Parents are informed of school updates, partake in the selection of 
speakers and have the opportunity to voice their questions and concerns. Students and families are also recognized 
for their involvement and efforts and receive certificates. 

 

ICT Lab Site Program (Collaborative Teachers) 

The ICT Lab Site Program's purpose is to improve teaching practices in co-teaching class settings. The program 
works with teaching partners to improve teaching strategies. The co-teaching partnership will work along with

models set in place, allowing students to have access to rigorous and differentiated instruction, that meets the 
students' needs. 

 

Learning Partners Program (Effective School Leadership) 

World View High School will be partnering with two schools for the 2017-18 school year through the Learning 
Partners New Teacher Preparation Partnership (LPNTPP) and New Visions for Public Schools. Each triad will 
participate in inter-visitations and include teacher leader roles. Model teachers at World View have demonstrating 
success in achieving instructional gains with students and will share their best practices with others as "lead 
learners." The LPP Model Teachers is a school-based teacher leadership role in which the teacher uses his/her 
classroom as a laboratory classroom and resource to support the goals of World View. 

 

Instructional Support (Supportive Environment) 

World View High School offers our incoming and current ELL students to enroll in the TBE program (Transitional 
Bilingual Education). TBE programs allow ELLs of one common language to receive instruction in the students’ 
native language with intensive support in English. As students develop their English proficiency, the time allocated 
to native-language learning shifts to English-language learning until the student reaches proficiency. ELLs enrolled 
in the TBE program will have the opportunity to continue to develop and foster their academic knowledge and skills 
in their native language and transfer that knowledge into their English-language learning. Our ELL students will 
have access to rich literature in their native language and be simultaneously introduced to the rigor of the ELA 
Common Core Standards. Students will also received instructions that will prepare them to perform well in 
NYSESLAT and MOSL tests. More importantly, ELL students at WVHS will have the opportunity to receive further 
support through our tutoring programs (Lunch and Learn, After School Tutoring, and Saturday Academy). Our main 
goal is to push our ELL students to move at least one level up in their annual NYSESLAT.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Populations 

 

Here at World View High School, it is our main priority to ensure that all our students can learn and progress towards 
college and career readiness. We have an excellent staff to meet the needs of every type of learner. Our school is 
home to a variety of students who come from around the world. Many of them speak a language other than English. 
Approximately one third of our students are English Language Learners. We have two programs to meet their needs - 
English as a New Language and Transitional Bilingual Education in Spanish. We also have students who learn 
differently. Approximately one fifth are Students with Disabilities. For these students we have a variety of classroom 
settings, including Integrated Co-Teaching.  

As with every school in the New York City Department of Education, we strive to close the achievement gap, 
especially with black and Latino males. With 49 percent of our student body being male, and 96 percent being black 
and Latino, it is especially crucial that we provide additional support where there are gaps to positively impact the 
number of students we graduate ready to enter college and the workforce.

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools 

 

According to our latest Quality Review, the areas of proficiency links with elements of Rigorous Instruction and 
Collaborative Teachers. These are the hallmarks of every good school. We will maintain these as we look to enhance 
the element of Strong Family-Community Ties. This year, with the creation of a family college and career center, 
staffed with a social worker/college adviser and parent coordinator, we hope to engage our school's families even 
more as we look towards creating stronger ties.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths:  

Based on our data from SY 2016-17, our 4-year graduation rate was 85.7%, and our credit accumulation rates are over 
90%. We attribute these to the following:  

Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating and aligned to the Common Core. During the inquiry cycle teachers 
from different content classes (ie. ELA, ENL, science and FL) utilized data measuring students’ reading and writing 
skills. Inquiry teams implemented a comprehensive needs assessment by looking at all available data using a Common 
Core aligned rubric.  

Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) have been embedded in the Professional Development cycle to include 
Grade Teams, Department Teams, as well as a Differentiated PD group where teachers chose groups that were of 
interest to them. These teams include all teachers and subjects with the goal of setting high standards in their 
classrooms by addressing this high leverage skill customized to student need and inclusive of all subgroups. These 
PLCs create actions steps to implement across disciplines to address the learning gap (and subsequent learning gaps) 
identified through the Inquiry Cycle. Students are actively engaged in this ambitious intellectual activity of improving 
their performance on this high leverage skill and develop their critical thinking skills through a deep understanding of 
this important process.  

Priority Need:  

Our school is performing at or above the borough and city rates for graduation and credit accumulation but our 
college/career readiness metrics are in need of improvement. Our college and Career Prep Course Index is 21.4%, 
CCPCI Lowest 3rd (CtAG) is 11.1%, 4-year college readiness index is 18.6%, and our College Readiness Lowest 3rd 
(CtAG) is 7.4%. We are looking to maintain high expectations with regards to graduation while improving outcomes 
for college readiness.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

To increase the college/career metrics and college readiness of our graduates (including SWDs and ELLs), all seniors will 
have taken at least one Advanced Placement or College Now course by June 2019.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
In the Spring of 2018, the AP coordinator and the school's college advisor presented to families during a PA meeting 
to inform them of the AP and College Now programs. Additionally, there were four assemblies for each grade where 
the same information was disseminated. Parents of new students were invited and participated in a school-wide 
orientation where staff and students met with parents and students to familiarize them with the rigorous 
expectations at World View High School. We are ensuring that we emphasize that all students will be taking at least 
one college level course in their four years in high school.  

At orientation parents were setup and trained in the use of PupilPath accounts to monitor their child’s progress. 
Students were additionally set-up with Google school accounts with google classrooms for each teacher to facilitate 
communication, submission of classwork and to share documents for homework, projects and schoolwork with their 
families.  

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths:  

Our school’s core strength is that we have dedicated support staff who are willing to go above and beyond to meet 
the social and emotional needs of our students. When more students feel safe and supported emotionally and 
socially, the more likely that they will accumulate credits, pass NYS Regents and continue to increase attendance 
towards graduation than the previous year.  

The Guidance team members continually support and monitor progress in their cohorts throughout their four years 
and reinforce to ensure that students are on-track to graduate and meet college/career expectations. The success of 
the guidance team is reflected in the fact that students rated guidance 94 percent positive on the 2017-18 NYC School 
Survey.  

In addition to the guidance team members, the school doubled the number advisory class this passed school year by 
making smaller groups (no larger than 12-15) that were gender specific. Our guidance team pushed-in to Advisory 
classes driven by teacher and student feedback. We also collaborated with the Morningside Center for Teaching Social 
Responsibility to ensure that we provided a comprehensive curriculum for advisory.  Through ongoing collaboration, 
each unit is planned to provide students with the life skills they need to prepare them for college and post-secondary 
endeavors. Students will be required to engage in collegial style discussions and debates about topics such as 
Community, Respect for All, and Integrity.  

Priority Need:  

One area of need is that we have no structured peer-mentoring program that supports students. Students rated "Peer 
Support for Academic Work" and "Personal Attention and Support" both at 73 percent positive on the NYC School 
Survey. We look to maintain high quality support through Advisory and the guidance team and improve peer 
support/individualized attention.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 60% of incoming freshmen will have been mentored for the school year by a trained upperclassmen to 
assist in transitioning to high school through the PALS (Peer Advisor, Leadership & Service) Program. The PALS staff 
coordinators, in collaboration with the guidance team, will monitor our progress towards this goal.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength:  

One great asset that World View has is its highly collaborative staff. It was noted in our last Quality Review as an area 
of celebration. Teachers rated peer collaboration 99% positive on the 2017-18 NYC School Survey. Teachers 
collaborate in inquiry teams, department teams and grade level teams to generate interdisciplinary units, aligned to 
the CCLS.  

Priority Need:  

Although our school is performing at or above the borough and city rates for graduation and credit accumulation, our 
college/career readiness metrics are in need of improvement. As stated previously, our College and Career Prep 
Course Index is 21.4%, CCPCI Lowest 3rd (CtAG) is 11.1%, 4-year college readiness index is 18.6%, and our College 
Readiness Lowest 3rd (CtAG) is 7.4%. We are looking to maintain high expectations with regards to graduation while 
improving outcomes for college readiness. We seek to do capitalize on our teachers' collaborative nature to vertically 
align curricula and increasing rigor. We will be using the AP for All model for vertical alignment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
To better prepare students for college level coursework, all teachers will meet in vertical teams for a minimum of 10 
sessions by June 2019, to ensure alignment of content and skills in curricula, through assessment and revision. This will 
lead to a 5% increase in the school's College and Career Prep Course Index.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
The goal of vertically aligned curricula is tied to the goal of increasing student participation in AP and College Now 
courses. The following parent engagement activities also reinforces our curricular modifications:  

In the Spring of 2018, the AP coordinator and the school's college advisor presented to families during a PA meeting 
to inform them of the AP and College Now programs. Additionally, there were four assemblies for each grade where 
the same information was disseminated. Parents of new students were invited and participated in a school-wide 
orientation where staff and students met with parents and students to familiarize them with the rigorous 
expectations at World View High School. We are ensuring that we emphasize that all students will be taking at least 
one college level course in their four years in high school.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength:  

In the 2017-18 NYC School Survey, the score for Effective School Leadership (an aggregate of school staff and parent 
survey responses) was a 4, +0.53 above the borough average and +0.45 above the city average.  

Our principal received a highly effective in his overall principal rating from the superintendent overseeing our school.  

These positive evaluations from these three different sources is indicative of the institutional and managerial 
knowledge of the principal and his ability to hold school stakeholders accountable for student success.  

Need:  

In order for the school to maintain solid student credit accumulation and graduation outcomes and improve college 
and career outcomes, the school needs to place a greater focus on high academic expectations. One of the primary 
ways of ensuring high expectations is by holding teachers accountable for planning, preparing, teaching, assessing, 
and reflecting – implementing school-wide best practices that have been shown to produce improvement in student 
outcomes.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strength:  

In the 2017-18 NYC School Survey, the score for Strong Family-Community Ties (an aggregate of school staff and 
parent survey responses) was a 3.82, +0.47 above the borough average and +0.41 above the city average.  

Our school was rated "Proficient" for the Quality Review Measure for Indicator 3.4: A culture of learning that 
communicates and supports high expectations  

A) Communication of high expectations to staff, inclusive of training, and a system of accountability  

B) Communication of and support for families' understanding of high expectations for college and career readiness  

C) Staff communicates and support high expectations to students  

These positive evaluations from these three different sources is indicative of the emphasis that our school places on 
the role of families in maintaining high expectations for the children we share.  

Priority Need:  

We will be growing to our biggest size in the Fall of 2018. We anticipate a student body size of 600+ children. We will 
not only have the more students than any other school year since our inception, but we will also have more parents 
than any other school year. We need to maintain our level of outreach and communication with our existing parents 
and foster new ties with the parents of the 200+ new incoming students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

As of June 
28th, 
2017 
World 
View has 
6 
registered 
students 
in 
temporary 
housing.  

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Before the end of the school year, the school checks in with these families to see if there are any changes in their 
housing status and all updates are recorded on ATS. These students are also informed of summer meal programs as 
well as other summer programs available to students in temporary housing. Once the students resume the school 
year in September, they are provided with a free uniform package and school supplies for the school year. 
Throughout the school year, families in temporary housing are provided with numerous programs, opportunities and 
resources that will aide them as they remain in temporary housing.  

 

Students in temporary housing are given priority in applying and being hired for the student aid program. Students 
are assisted with the Summer Youth Application and work/internship application completion process. Counseling is 
offered in school an mental health services are offered in Montefiore School-Based Mental Health Center. Counselors 
and social workers collaborate with case workers at shelters to ensure open communication between agency and 
school. World view also participates in the City Harvest Food drive which donates food to families in need. 
Thanksgiving Food Baskets will be given to students in temporary Housing this November. Families in temporary 
housing are provided with resources such as food pantries list and housing agencies that assist families in temp 
housing.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

Teachers will be recruited through the Open Market Hiring DOE site as well as New Visions New Teacher Finder. 

Administration and department teachers with a team of school staff will attend hiring fairs through the DOE and the 
New Visions Affinity Group in the Spring and, if necessary, the Summer. Candidates will come to interviews with team 
of school staff and, if invited, perform a demonstration lesson for our students while school staff observe and take 
notes. 

We retain our teachers through incorporating all stakeholders in the development of the school. With their 
collaboration, input and involvement, they have more of a vested interest in the school – rather than experience a 
“top-down” approach. 

New teachers will be trained regarding the school mission, vision, expectations, grading policy, ladder of referral, 
project requirements, portfolio process, and other related procedures. They will be matched with an administrator 
that will meet with them during the planning process and observe them regularly in the class and give them feedback 
on the domains of the Danielson rubric. All teachers, including new teachers, will attend weekly PD developed by a 
team of administrators and teaching staff. The goals and focus will be shaped by school goals, teacher goals and 
needs, and the DOE Instructional Expectations. 

Teacher assignments will be determined by the administration in conjunction with the hiring team, which is 
comprised of teachers from the new teacher’s department. Each semester the teaching assignments will be 
determined by administration and the guidance counselor with input from the department teams.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We provide a rich PD experience through a three-pronged approach to allow for breadth, depth and differentiation. 
We are utilizing the Monday PD structure (with foci on the main Danielson Components) in conjunction with inquiry 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
N/A 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
 

When the school was established, it was our shared goal to be a project based school. As such, we have developed 
marking period projects centered on scaffolding a performance task. We also had envisioned end of semester 
portfolio interviews where students met with a teacher to describe their learning through their projects and other 
class materials. 

All teachers hired were on board and received professional development around creating these curricular materials 
through our New Visions Affinity Group. 

As a school, we must prepare students for Common Core aligned Regents exams in addition to MOSL assessments.  

With regards to the MOSL:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

Based off of data analysis from SY 2017-2018 inquiry work, students definitely made some gains. Nevertheless, the 
majority of our students are still not performing on grade level. We will continue to have literacy as one of our school-
wide foci. We as a school, through the MOSL committee, selected to use the NYC ELA Performance Task as our Local 
Measurement for last year’s teacher rating – knowing that if we make that our end point, we can use backwards 
planning and shared rubrics to ensure that all our students were growing in literacy and could demonstrate progress 
through this MOSL selection  

Through our inquiry groups, we will continue to gather and analyze student assessment data to see what works, what 
is not, and what we can do better to see improved student outcomes 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows:

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. World View High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

World View High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Our student body is 32% ELL. With such a significant number of students coming from Latin 
America, we made sure that we accommodate their needs through Native Language Arts, ENL 
and ELA classes as well as content teachers who speak Spanish.  
In our school, 18% students are entering, 25% are emerging , 25% are transitioning,  32% are 
expanding (as indicated by their NYSESLAT scores).  19% of our ELLs are SWDs.  6.5% of the 
student body is former ELLs. 
In order to assist our newcomers, developing ELLs, and former ELLs with meeting benchmarks 
that indicate an on-track graduation trajectory, we offer direct instruction during Saturday 
Academy classes (in English and Spanish) in the four content areas to support and enhance 
academic language acquisition. There are two time frames in which students are assigned to 
attend: 9:00 am to 10:30 am and 10:30 am - 12 pm.  Our program will end in June 2019.  We 
have two bilingual certified teachers and two ESL certified teachers teaching. 
In addition, we will offer English classes to our newcomer students starting in February (separate 
from their ELA and ENL classes) that assist in language acquisition and fluency.  We have 3 
teachers involved in the English classes (ESL certified).  Students will attend from 10:30 am - 
12:00 pm. They will practice all modalities of language - listening, speaking, reading, writing.   
Teachers have been engaged in creating their own curriculum to support the goals of material 
mastery in Algebra, ELA, Global History, Living Environment, and academic English 
acquisition.   
Attendance will be taken every Saturday and will be maintained by our school guidance 
counselor. Transportation and snacks are provided to the students at no cost to them or to Title 
III. 
The cost to Title III is $19,534 for per session for teachers for the 2018-2019 school year.

topics include strategies for addressing the needs of ELLs and SWDs. Not only is it 
differentiated, but staff may also utilizes it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  
The site is pd360.com and the vendor is Frontline Education. We purchased licenses for our 
staff. The license is valid for the school year and the records are kept electronically.  The school 
expectation is that teachers log a total of 4 hours per month. Our Assistant Principal of 
Supervision will facilitate and track usage. 
This will be at no cost to Title III for the 2018-2019 school year. 
We have 4 teachers (one math, one science, one SpEd and one social studies) involved in the 
Multilingual Learner Project - a partnership between City College and New Visions for Public 
Schools to help train teachers to get their TESOL certification. They have been taking classes 
and attending workshops to improve their instruction for English Language Learners.

Begin description here:            
We hold monthly bilingual workshops (8 in total, every second Thursday of the month) to 
educate parents with strategies to help their students.  We send out letters with the monthly 
bulletins with all important dates (including these workshops) and also use school messenger to 
do phone calls home the week of these workshops. 
We provide parents and guardians with food and gifts as incentives to attend our meetings. These 
meetings will cover a wide range of topics that are important to all students, including ELLs and 
SWDs.  Topics include FAFSA, TAP, college application process, and community resources.  
By incentivizing attendance, we get the opportunity to provide parents with information that help 
their children succeed after graduation.  Agendas of these workshops and sign in sheets will be 
maintained by the parent coordinator, who is bilingual in both English and Spanish.  The parent 
coordinator and our college advisor/social workers will be coordinating these workshops and 
inviting outside speakers to these events. 
These workshops are held for an hour and 15 minutes every month during the school year. 
This will be at no cost to Title III for the 2018-2019 school year.

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
During the first week of the academic year all English teachers administer either Achieve3000 or ThinkCerca reading software 
as a reading baseline to all students in the school.  The data they generate will provide teachers with an approximate reading 
grade level for each student.  This data shows that nearly all ELLs are reading at least three grade levels below their current 
grade.  This data is used in our instructional plan when grouping students, assigning projects, assigning text to read and to set 
the curriculum pacing.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

All ENL teachers are part of an academic-based inquiry group for each grade that gather and analyze data of WVHS students, 
including ELL students, based on their reading and writing skills and the progress they make during the year.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Every year, when the NYSESLAT data is communicated to the school the ENL teachers meet to discuss data patterns, students' 
proficiency levels and student strengths and weaknesses.  The ENL teachers then analyze the data for the number of students 
who test out of ENL services and for those who moved up one proficiency level.  If the majority of the students are making 
gains the program is concerned to be successful and changes are made to further increase student achievement.  If the data 
shows an unsuccessful program the ENL teachers will meet with administrators to discuss implementation changes, class 
changes and focus areas.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, the ENL department holds a monthly department meeting  to track the progress 
of ELL students.  ENL teachers also make a list of students who are falling behind in their progress and an individualized plan is 
deviced for them (contacting parents, meeting with student, meeting with counselor, etc.).  In addition, all inquiry groups (9th 
to 12th grades, reading and writing inquiry groups) all have an ENL teacher member to represent the needs of our ELL 
students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Across all grades and all proficiency levels the ELLS display the same pattern: their Listening and Speaking Scores on the 
NYSESLAT are higher than their Reading and Writing Scores.  For the students in the TBE program, most of their scores for all 
modalities were in the high beginner/low intermediate range.   For the students in the free standing ENL program, the majority 
of our students are testing in the Intermediate and Advanced range for all four modalities.  The pattern across all grade levels 
appears to lend itself to the bell shaped curve.       
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ELL students that demonstrate a score of Entering and Emerging in all four modalities, but especially in the Speaking and 
Listening sections would most likely be placed in a TBE program while ELL students that demonstrate a score of Transitioning 
and above in all four modalities would most likely be placed in a free standing ENL program. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Currently we have 153 ELLs; they range in skill levels from ENTERING to EXPANDING. Based on the results of the 
Spring 2017 NYSESLAT Exam most of the ENL students at WVHS scored higher on the Listening and Speaking section 
of the exam than the Reading and Writing section.  They are orally proficient but have not mastered the academic 
literacy that is required for them to pass the NYSESLAT or be successful in the content area classroom. In addition, we 
have a significant amount of our TBE ENLs who are not yet orally proficient in English whose needs are different than 
the Long Term ELLs/ ELLs who are already orally proficient in English; therefore, we have attempted to create a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Language Allocation Policy that provides the coherence needed to create a standard understanding of how language 
is used in the classroom while at the same time providing the flexibility to meet the needs of a wide range of student 
language proficiency.  To this effect we have implemented an ENL instructional program that is a hybrid push-in/pull 
out model. We have five ENL certified teachers and one ENL certified assistant principal who service the ELLs.   Most 
ELLs (whether they are short-term or long-term ELLs) in the same grade level are put into one strand that follows the 
same schedule and all ELLs in these strands receive enough support to be in compliance with CR PART 154 for 
beginner students. At times a few ENL students will come in with Regents and/or high school credit.  For these 
students their minutes are met through freestanding ENL classes.  The main component of our program is 
collaborative team teaching that occurs between content area teachers and the ENL teachers. Both teachers plan 
together with the special needs of ELLs in mind and implement the lesson cooperatively.  Students are also 
programmed for a freestanding ENL class in the afternoon based on their NYSESLAT scores.   Lower performing ENLs 
have small group tutoring with 2 to 10 students in the group either during the school day, after-school and/or on 
Saturday. Tutoring includes Math Lab using MathXL software for differentiation, ELA lab using literacy interventions 
such as ThinkCerca for struggling readers and pre-literate students.  At World View High School, each grade is divided 
into strands.  For each grade level there is an ENL strand and a TBE Spanish strand.   Although the two ELL groups are 
divided between the most proficient and least proficient students, the strands tend to be heterogeneous.   Classes are 
45 minutes long. Below is how this coherent but flexible language policy fits into the 8 principles of a strong language 
allocation policy. Principle One: A Coherent Language Policy In implementing a push-in/CTT model we have also had 
to think about how we use both languages in the classroom. We face the challenge of a diverse ELL population in 
terms of language proficiency but not sufficient numbers to make possible separate classes by language proficiency. 
However, because almost all of our ENLs come from a Spanish-speaking background,  we have mapped out how to 
strategically use both English and the native language to best support our students. The ENL teachers in conjunction 
with content teachers and the administration have developed a language policy that we feel takes into account the 
individual needs of all of our students.  Teachers regularly provide glossaries, text translated into Spanish, and 
explanations in Spanish.  Quite a few of our teachers are proficient in Spanish. Principle Two: Academic Rigor Through 
the push-in model we ensure that all ENLs at WVHS participate in instructional programs that are aligned with ENL, 
ELA, and CCLS content learning standards as well as have access to a regents prep curriculum. Through the push-in 
CTT model, teachers use ENL strategies and methodologies as well as native language support when necessary to 
address the needs of students at various proficiency levels.  Principle Three: Use of Two Languages As mentioned 
above, the native language is used as support within content area classes. The rationale behind this is that in the 
content classroom our curricular goal is to have students master the concepts in a way that they can then apply to the 
Regents exams and pass with a 65 or above. Because they can take these exams in their native language there is no 
reason we see why they cannot use their native language to make meaning out of the material in class.  In order to 
help ENLs who are at the beginner level, we assure that there is an ENL certified teacher in the classroom particularly 
for instruction in Global History. Principle Four: Explicit ENL and ELA Instruction The ENL and content teachers plan 
together to ensure that ENL methodologies are infused throughout the curriculum; this includes scaffolding 
techniques, strategies to make academic literacy explicit throughout the content areas, as well as infusing language 
functions and structures into lesson plans.  In the ELA class, all instruction is in English. In addition, all written 
products of students are expected to be in English and students are encouraged to speak only in English. Of course, 
appropriate sheltering techniques based on QTEL are used in these classes. However, if with all of this support a 
student is still struggling to express him or herself, translation assistance by another student, teacher or bilingual 
paraprofessional are provided. The goal is to challenge students to practice their English while allowing them to feel 
as if they can express themselves and feel as if their native culture and language are respected.  We have an ENL 
instructional program that uses a variety of approaches - push-in, pull out and CTT classes.  The main component of 
our program is collaborative team teaching that occurs between content area teachers and the ENL teachers. Both 
teachers plan together with the special needs of ELLs in mind and implement the lesson cooperatively. 
       

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

In the ENL  team-taught content area classes, the language policy varies based on the needs of the students. Whole 
class instruction is always given in English. In addition, reading materials are also in English. Students who have 
stronger English skills (most of our ELLs) do their assignments in English. However, our newcomer students are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

permitted to write their answers in Spanish. In addition, oral translation of the content is provided to these students 
by the ENL teacher if necessary. This comes in the form of responsible code-switching, where when it is clear the 
student does not understand the material, a summary of the material is provided in Spanish. The idea behind this is 
that in these content area classes, mastery of content is most important and if a child needs to make meaning in their 
native language this should not only be permitted but encouraged.  In the TBE program, the home language is used to 
deliver the content in the 9th and 10th grades.  Students in these grades receive their instruction for math, science 
and social studies in Spanish.  During the final semester of their 10th grade year, students begin to transition to 
English instruction.  In their 11th and 12th grade years those students in the TBE programmed have transitioned and 
take their core classes in English.  The content teacher instructs the students in English using ENL strategies (see 
above).

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

         All students receive ELA instruction for at least 45 minutes a day/5 days a week.  All ELL students are in two strands.  One 
strand is a TBE group and another strand is a Stand Alone ENL group.  Students in these strands receive ENL support in one to 
two of their content classes each day (2 classes of support per day/ 90 minutes per day/5 days a week).  Students receive NLA 
support for 45 minutes a day/5 days a week.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 The ENL and content teachers plan together to ensure that ENL methodologies are infused throughout the curriculum; this 
includes scaffolding techniques, strategies to make academic literacy aligned with the Commons Core Standards throughout 
the content areas, as well as infusing language functions and structures into lesson plans.  In the ELA and ENL classes, all 
instruction is in English. In addition, all written products of students are expected to be in English and students are encouraged 
to speak only in English. Of course, appropriate sheltering techniques based on QTEL are used in these classes. However, if 
with all of this support a student is really struggling to express him or herself, translation assistance by another student or the 
teacher are provided. The goal is to challenge students to practice their English while allowing them to feel as if they can 
express themselves and feel as if their native culture and language are respected.  In math and science classes, all instruction is 
in English.  Students written work can be in English or their native language.  Assessments are provided in English and Spanish 
but students.  Practices aligned with the Common Core Standards like summarizing, vocabulary projects, three reads, KWL, 
Frayer Model and List, Group, Label are used in class.  Also, specfically for the math class, students work on deltamath.com to 
sharpen basic math skills they may be deficient in. For beginners, the ENL teachers use the following resources to develop a 
curriculum: English Structure Practice, Sensational Sentences, Puzzle Paragraphs, Cake Looks Great (ENL reader) and Phonics 
for Older Students. For high beginners, the ENL teachers use Basic Reading Power, Daily Reading Comprehension, Password 1 
and What a World Reading. For Intermediate students the ENL program uses Visions Volume C published by Thomson Heinle. 
The book is supplemented with books from the library and internet sources.  Students also read classic novels that are adapted 
for their reading levels, such novels are "Romeo and Juliet", short stories and biographies and autobiographies, and excerpts 
from "The House on Mango Street"  For high intermediate/advanced student a series called "Ready to Write" (three books for 
three levels) is used as well as texts from "Bridges to Literature".  Students also read classic novels that are adapted for their 
reading levels, such texts are "The Scarlet Letter", "Great Expectations", and "Macbeth". Websites frequently visited by our 
ENL department include englishforeveryone.org; eslflow.com; rong-chang.com; 
usingenglish.com,  and  famouspeoplelessons.com, and vocabulary.com.      
     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?

content assistance.  These classes are used to help students understand the content and keep up with the work of their core 
content classes.  ENL teachers interact with content teachers to see which students need the most help in various 
subjects. b.  For newcomers (who are usually beginners) we place the student in an TBE class where an ENL teacher will 
provide support in content classes and students receive instruction in their native language.  Additionally, they are given an 
ENL class to work on language acquistion skills four days a week. 
c.  For Students who have been identified as developing we use the CTT model to provide support in core classes, and, 
depending on skill level, assign the student to an additional ENL class. Developing students are still typically placed in the TBE 
classes. d.   In order to meet the needs of LTEs at WVHS, we have implemented an ENL instructional program in a hybrid push-
in/pull-out model.    We have found this model to be very effective in helping and meeting the needs of LTEs to improve their 
linguistic and academic skills so that they become English proficient, meet state standards, and promotion/graduation 
programs.  ELLs who have received services for four to six years will be monitored to determine if their language acquisition is 
at the expected rate of progress. Furthermore, in order to properly instruct these students, a determination is made by the 
administration, guidance councelors and educators as to whether their proficiency is merely a surface conversational 
proficiency - they have basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) whereby students respond to contextual or 
paralinguistic cues, or cognitive language academic proficiency (CALP). If it is a surface conversational proficiency then further 
testing will be necessary to determine if the delay in language acquisition is due to other factors such as the inablity of the 
student to respond to higher cognitive demands such as writing or intellectual discussions. If the delay is skill based and not 
language based then theses students will be targeted for AIS in all content areas. If the delay is language, then more exposure 
to the English language is built into the students program.  e. Former ENL students receive ENL support through CCT in their 
core subject classes.       
      
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
*All of our ELL-SWD are evaluated by both the ENL and SPED teachers in the building.  If the certified teachers decide that the 
student's ELL needs are greater than their special education needs then the student is given an ELL program fit to their 
proficiency with an elective that provides them with Special Education services.  If the student's special education needs are 
greater than their ELL needs then the reverse is true; the students are given a special education program fit to their needs and 
receive a freestanding ENL class as an elective to service the student's ELL needs.  For beginners, the ENL teachers use the 
following resources to develop a curriculum: English Structure Practice, Sensational Sentences, Puzzle Paragraphs, Cake Looks 
Great (ENL reader) and Phonice for Older Students. For high beginners, the ESL teachers use Basic Reading Power, Daily 
Reading Comprehension, Password 1 and What a World Reading. For Intermediate students the ENL program uses Visions 
Volume C published by Thomson Heinle. The book is supplemented with books from the library and internet sources.  For high 
intermediate/advanced student a series called "Ready to Write" (three books for three levels) is used as well as texts from 
"Bridges to Literature". Websites frequently visited by our ESL department include englishforeveryone.org; eslflow.com; rong-
chang.com; usingenglish.com, famouspeoplelessons.com, vocabulary.com, and thinkcerca.com.  Two teachers, one ENL 
licensed, the other Special Education with an ENL extension co-teach for a double period each day. The class is separated into 
cooperative learning groups based on proficiency level and frequent assessments are given which drives instruction. 
Instructional strategies include previewing target text, teacher modeling of oral reading, oral reading prompts, visual spacial 
displays, text look back strategy, story mapping, context clue skill training, and story retelling, rubric 
assessments,brainistorming, pre-writing and drafting.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Carrying out PD before school begins to highlight our goal and to communicate clear expectations for effective curriculum and 
instruction for all students, including SWDs and ELLs.  Purchase and implementation of research-based differentiated 
professional development program, “PD360”, now known as “Edivation” where teachers are assigned segments, reflection 
questions and follow up questions connected to that cycles’ focus component.  Teachers also can look up strategies and 
activities in areas where they feel they need improvement which can include strategies to help SWDs and/or ELLs.  Through 
supporting teacher development administration supports the teachers to support the students to achieve their IEP goals and 
attain English Lanuage proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  ENL and Sped teachers will also be a part of PD 
groups where they will be supported in areas where they feel they need more guidance in, based on their reflection and 
observation from adminstration.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide a variety of intervention services.  After-school and Saturday tutoring will be available for all ENL students, grades 
9-12, in all content areas including ELA, United States History and Government, Integrated Algebra, and Living 
Environment.  The students will be prepared for New York State Regents examinations.  The goal is to improve language skills 
and content understanding to ensure success on state examinations.  Lunch and learn began October 5, 2016, and will run 
through June 2017.  Struggling students are mandated to attend Saturday and/or lunch tutoring in order to make up for 
deficient skills.  All students are welcome to attend Saturday school if they feel that they can benefit from the extra help and 
instruction. Deparment Inquiry teams meet every other week and identify students that are in need of academic support.       
      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

WVHS ENL and ELA teachers held informational meetings with incoming ELL students and presented them with a folder with all 
information needed in order to prepare for the upcoming school year.  Included in this folder is differentiated summer reading 
and writing assignment.  Not only will it help the students to maintain an academic mindset during the summer but also enable 
the teachers to gather data and assess students' skills in the beginning of the school year. 
 
During the school year, several content teachers, including a Global History, US History, and Science teacher (with Sped 
license), are planning on holding tutoring sessions geared specifically for ENL students.  The program will meet at least twice a 
week during lunch period and once a week after school. The purpose of this activity is to provide support for ELL students in 
several content classes, reviewing the content. They will discuss key terms and concepts. 
 
Specifically, many activities are also designed to help student's writing in Social Studies by reviewing sentence starters for 
transitions, rewriting a thesis statements and general essay organization. It will be open only to those students whose Social 
Studies class ends with a Regents because the content is focused on Regents material. We have also hired additional teacher 
that are bilingual certified, ESOL certified, and Sped certified to meet the growing needs of our ENL/TBE program.     
   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded all of the same opportunities to participate in any and all school activities.  Information from the school is 
always translated into Spanish so that all students and families have access to important notices and 
announcements.  Teachers/adminstrators/school staff communicate to the students in their native language.  ENL teachers are 
responsible for making sure that their students are included.  In fact, ELLs participate in school activities at a higher rate than 
non-ELLs.   By chance, almost the entire Community Service Club is comprised of TBE/ENL students.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
This year the school has purchased more Chromebooks for all the ELA classrooms.  This way ENL students have direct 
opportunities with technology to deepen their English skills.    Each content ENL classroom is equipped with a Smart/Tech cart 
that is used on a daily basis.  Materials used to help students develop their skills include videos that teachers download from 
the Internet (news, story summaries) and displayed on projectors and elmos.    Teachers also use guided note-taking graphic 
organizers and have students do dictation and practice note taking skills.  Native language materials are used in the math, 
science, Global and US History classes, and are provided by the teacher.  Assessments are the most commmon classroom 
material that is translated into the students' native language.  Almost all instruction is completed in English. For beginners, the 
ENL teachers use the following resources to develop a curriculum: English Structure Practice, Sensational Sentences, Puzzle 
Paragraphs, Cake Looks Great (ESL reader) and Phonice for Older Students.  For high beginners, the ENL teachers use Basic 
Reading Power, Daily Reading Comprehension, Password 1 and What a World Reading. For Intermediate students the teacher 
uses books from the library and internet sources.       
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the ENL  team-taught content area classes, the language policy varies based on the needs of the students. Whole class 
instruction is always given in English. In addition, reading materials are also in English. Students who have stronger English 
skills (most of our ELLs) do their assignments in English. However, our newcomer students are permitted to write their answers 
in Spanish. In addition, oral translation of the content is provided to these students by the ENL teacher if necessary. This comes 
in the form of responsible code-switching, where when it is clear the student does not understand the material, a summary of 
the material is provided in Spanish. ELLs in the beginner group also receives additional support in the form of a language 
paraprofessional.  The idea behind this is that in these content area classes, mastery of content is most important and if a child 
needs to make meaning in their native language this should not only be permitted but encouraged.  In the TBE program, the 
home language is used to deliver the content in the 9th and 10th grades.  Students in these grades receive their instruction for 
math, science and social studies in Spanish.  During the final semester of their 10th grade year, students begin to transition to 
English instruction.  In their 11th and 12th grade years those students in the TBE programmed have transitioned and take their 
core classes in English.  The content teacher instructs the students in English using ENL strategies (see above).    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELLs are accordingly placed based on multiple factors (age, NYSESLAT level, baseline assessment, years of services, 
etc.).  Resources speficially designed for ENL students like the Penguin Book Series have been purchased to use as mature 
reading materials for the beginner and intermediate classes.  One ENL teacher is designated to work with each grade of 
ELLs (9th grade ENL teacher, 10th grade ENL teacher, 11th grade ENL teacher, and 12th grade ENL teacher).  These ENL teacher 
then meet twice monthly in order to analyze growth of all ELLs and their strengths and need for further support.  Through 
these meetings, the ENL department, with the support administrators and guidance counselors, can determine if ELL student 
should remain in TBE program or be transferred to Stand Alone ENL program.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
As an independent school, we have been meeting the needs of our ELLs independently of the other schools in the building. 
However, this year we are trying to coordinate a campus-wide intervisitiation program such that teachers (including ENL 
Teachers and teachers of ELLs) can observe best practices in classrooms outside their home school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The school holds an orientation for new students a few days before the first day of school.  Students meet their teachers, visit 
classrooms and receive their student planners and their school uniforms.  The students and their families visit each content 
area teacher learning the expectations of each class, the clubs and activities of the school and where the gym, bathrooms and 
cafeteria are located.  ELL students participate in numerous activities including Community Service Club, Technology Club, Step 
Team, Culture Club, etc.

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Students can take Spanish Literature and Japanese and French as a foreign language as electives.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our five full-time ENL teachers are fully certified in ENL.  One assistant principal is also ENL certified.   In addition, one of them 
has attended QTEL workshops, and another teacher has attended extensive UFT workshops on supporting ELLs to pass the 
English Regents.   In addition, an on-going collaboration with the New Visions initiatives provides teachers working with ELLs 
on-going support for how to infuse literacy throughout the curriculum and how to plan for language functions.  All staff attend 
Professional Development workshops every Monday afternoon.  The focus of these workshops is literacy across the content 
areas. Included in all workshops, are discussions on how to effectively differentiate instruction for ELLs.  These sessions include 
ENL teachers, subject area teachers, Special Education teachers, guidance counselors, paraprofessionals and 
administrators.  The professional development workshops are led by one of our assistant principals, Heather Flay.  Each PD 
cycle a literacy/ENL strategy is presented to the staff and then the staff must use the strategy in their classroom and reflect on 
it.   The AP keep a binder of the sign-in sheets with the lessons taught to the staff and handouts that were given out to 
staff.  At the end of the workshops the hours are totaled by Heather Flay and she produces certificates for the teachers as 
proof they completed the 7.5 hours of training (usually teachers complete 12 hours).  Strategies are not content-specific and 
can be used in any classroom.  The workshop teacher provides the staff with examples as to how the strategies can be used. As 
part of our school wide professional development program, we give teachers the opportunity to attend professional 
development workshops outside of the school building to increase their understanding of the Common Core Standards and 
ENL instruction.  If any costs are incurred, our school pays 50% of registration fees and other associated fees.  Professional 
development opportunities include everything from inter-visitations to conferences.  As part of our school wide professional

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section.

work and department meetings accounts for 50% of professional development time on Mondays.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Every second Thursday of every month World View High School holds a family night.  Parents come into the school to meet 
with teachers to discuss their child's progress.  It is during this time individual meetings with parents of ELLs are scheduled to 
discuss goals of the program, language development, language proficiency assessment results and language development 
needs in the content areas.  Meetings are communicated to the parents through school wide calendars, Skedula and translated 
letters/flyers sent home to parents.    Answer to number 2:  sign in sheets are maintained in the ELL binder in room 305A as 
well as copies of letters, calendars, etc.

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
This year will be the first academic year when the school's Peer Inter visitation Initiative will be fully operational.  This program was 
through the initiative of the school's ENL coordinator, who is also the ENL department head, and the ELA department head.  This 
initiative will enable all pedagogues of the school to visit classrooms to observe and gather strategies to further support our ELL 
students.  ENL teachers may visit the classrooms of ELLS in different core content classes to observe their perfomance and vice 
versa.  The initiative has also been opened to pedagogues of the two other schools in the building. 
 
This year will be the second year of our school's participation in the LPP-UTR program with New Vision.  Through this program, our 
ENL teacher work closely with an Urban Teacher Resident (UTR).  The collaboration between the ENL teacher and ENL UTR will 
provide more opportunities for academic support for our ELL students.  here:

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Martin Hernandez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During the summer, or on the student’s first day of attendance, incoming students go through an on boarding 
process where they fill out all necessary information. During this process students complete the Home Language 
Identification Survey and the blue card. We use this information, as well as the information already in ATS, to 
determine language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication.
