Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

“47” ASL and English High School Mission: 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At “47”, The American Sign Language and English High School, we believe that all students have the right to learn in 
an inclusive, academically rigorous environment. Our elective courses challenge our students’ creativity and our 
graduates emerge proficient in ASL. Our school community nurtures responsible citizens of the world, addressing all 
aspects of young adult development by providing the necessary individual supports for our students to be college and 
career ready 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

 

 

 

 

  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

We have several strategic partnerships and collaborations. We partner with the College Summit program to provide 
students with the tools to apply for college. We are also active with the Advanced Placement Expansion Initiative and 
we have partnerships with Baruch College, LaGuardia College and New York University.  

We are a citywide Respect for All School and we support a culture which nurtures, challenges and respects all 
community members in a barrier free and least restrictive environment for all of our students.. By mitigating barriers, 
our students are able to more fully engage in academically rigorous instruction. In addition to our Mindfulness 
practices, we incorporate Ross Greene's Plan B Collaborative Problem Solving Approach to challenges that arise in our 
community. All teachers engage in student case studies, Grade Team Kid's Talk and cooperative group learning 
structures are employed in all classrooms. Faculty routinely engage in Courageous Conversations about Race as well 
as routine analysis of student work using New Teacher Center protocols. These tools are used to responsively plan 
and revise lessons and units as well as community events and Town Halls.  

Teachers have become adept at using formative, interim and summative data to revise lessons and units. Our 
community believes in providing equal access for all of our students. Equal access is provided through our strong 
network. We have community coordinators, a guidance counselor and a social worker who work with all of our grade 
teams and students to address the needs of specific students as well as groups of students.  

 

We collaborate with our sister school, 02M347 to provide high quality arts instruction to our community. We share 
art and dance teachers. We have also re-established our partnership with 3rd Street Music Settement with the help of 
an Arts Matters Grant to ensure that all of our community members experience multiple arts and arts enrichment.  

 

Our school serves students from all 5 boroughs and we receive Title 1 funding for school-wide programs. Our 
graduation rate and credit accumulation are above the New York City average and we have exceeded our target with 
regards to Closing the Achievement Gap, according to the High School Quality Snapshot ; improvements with regards 
to several components of the Framework for Great Schools have contributed to our growth. “47” provides daily 
tutoring in addition to weekend AP preparation, college and career focused trips and activities.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The percentage of students with Individual Education Plans (IEP’s) and 504 Plans is far higher than the Manhattan 
average. We are estimating approximately 37% of our students.. We also are estimating that 10% of our students will 
receive ENL services next semester. Supporting these populations requires strategic programming; including 
additional Integrated Co Teaching classes, SETSS supports, ENL supports, additional related services and partnerships 
with local organizations to provide internship opportunities for students. Several students qualify for both ENL 
services and Special Education Services. Our unique community serves Deaf, hearing and hard of hearing students in 
heterogenously grouped classrooms; this requires us to provide ASL interpreters as well as professional learning 
around Deaf Culture and American Sign Language.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our current area of focus is revision of Common Core learning Standards aligned units using assessment data and 
research-based best practices to ensure that all of our students are engaged in increasingly rigorous instruction (
Student Achievement, Rigorous Instruction, Effective Leadership). Departments and grade teams meet weekly to 
analyze student work and revise instructional practices. Both departments and grade teams engage in action research 
to strengthen their practices as professional learning communities (Effective Leadership, Supportive Environment, 
Trust, Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers).  

As a community, we have grown with regards to both Tenet 4 and Tenet 5. Teachers work in both vertical and 
horizontal teams to assess student learning, revise curricula and address students’ social and emotional needs 
(Rigorous Instruction, Trust, Collaboration).  

 

The tenets that continue to be areas of focus are Tenets 3 and 6. Department Teams meet weekly to engage in 
student work analysis as well as lesson and unit revisions. This year, each team is engaging in action research and all 
teachers engage in individual case studies which align with their action research. All new and developing teachers 
receive mentoring or coaching and teachers work with the administrative team to assess and plan professional 
learning. Because many of our students live far from the school, it is difficult to bring parents and families into the 
school. We have an on site parent coordinator to stays in contact with parents daily and offered parent workshops 
during the school year; we are also planning weekend social events as well as College and Career events to increase 
parent involvement.  

Our greatest area of strength is student achievement. Last year; the four year graduation rate for students at “47” this 
year was 94%; This year, nearly all students received enough credits to be promoted to the next grade level and we 
observed significant increases in the Regents exams targeted in last year's CEP. Gains were made through daily 
teacher teams meetings(Collaborative Teachers) focused on analyzing student work (Rigorous Instruction) and 
revising units in response to this analysis. The elements of the Framework that we will address will again be teacher 
teams and rigorous instruction for this year. We will work to increase pass rates and individual student scores on 
Regents and SAT’s.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths:  

● Teacher Teams work collaboratively during daily meetings to analyze student work using a common language and 
revise lessons based upon student needs and common beliefs about how students learn best. Artifacts include 
Common Core aligned and staff developed lesson plan templates, Unit Plan templates and Scope and Sequence; NTC 
Protocol for Looking at Student Work, Grading Policy, Case Studies, Conferencing Systems (School Quality Review, 
Professional Learning Calendar, Teacher Team meeting minutes).  

● Teachers work together in teacher teams to give each other feedback on lessons and units (Mentoring schedule, 
Teacher Team minutes, Google Drive artifacts).  

● All teachers non-tenured or receiving a Developing rate meet with a New Teacher Center trained mentor to review 
and revise lessons.  

● Teacher teams engage in Action Research individually and in teams as a routine professional practice, this has 
resulted in the use of a school wide essay writing tools and rubrics 

Needs:  

● Increase opportunities for interdisciplinary classroom intervisitations, sharing of best practices and units of study 
(specifically related to writing and literacy) and opportunities for content collaboration (Regents Item Analysis, Case 
Studies, NTC Analysis, Classroom Observations, MOSL, MOTP) 

● School-wide use of an array of assessment data to inform targeted instruction and revise curricula resulting in 
increases in Regents scores (Regents Item Analysis, Progress to Graduation Tracker, School Quality Guide).  

 

- Focused use of Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix to increase student engagement and rigor during lesson 
planning (classroom observation, student work review, lesson plan review)  

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Strengths: 

-Use of school wide Common Core Learning Standards and Hess’ Cognitive Rigor Matrix aligned lesson plan, Unit Plan 
and Scope and Sequence Templates, school-wide use of cooperative group learning strategies, Conferencing, NTC 
Analysis of student work and Case Studies. Teachers plan together daily in departments and weekly in grade teams 
(Student Achievement, Collaborative Teachers, Rigorous Instruction). Our strengths were identified using multiple data 
sources, which include the School Quality Review, High School Quality Snapshot and Learning Environment Survey 

 

Needs: 

 

-Continue to refine process for using data sources and interim measures to inform lesson planning and to create more 
rigorous and engaging lessons which emphasize student to student discussion (School Quality Snapshot, School 
Quality Guide, SQR, LES, Progress to Graduation Tracker) 

 

-Work together to create stronger Family-Community Ties (School Quality Snapshot, School Quality Guide, SQR, LES) 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By improving our integration of meaningful questioning and discussion strategies (3b,3c- Danielson)) and using data 
wisely (Danielson 3d) by adjusting instruction accordingly in all classes, teachers rated Developing in targeted 
components will increase by a minimum of 10% by June 2019 as evidenced by the New York City ADVANCE

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 47 The American Sign Language and English Secondary School, in 
compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[47 ASLHS] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology, such as Teacherease and NYCDOE Family Tools 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children through the incorporation of monthly family 
workshops 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress, through grade team led family engagement activities, such as on Open School Night 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; Tuesday Professional Learning dedicated to Family Engagement

The school’s Parent Involvement  
 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use  interim assessment such  Scantron Edperformance,  which we give a minimum of 3 times a year, Anchor Projects in 
each class twice a year, the NYS Regents exams, NYC MOSL content area performance tasks and Castle Learning to assess the 
literacy skills of ELL's. This data provides us generalized reading and writing levels for each student, as well as content specific 
data.  This information supports all pedagogues in determining what the needs of their ELL's are. These assessments support 
staff in focusing on students specific needs and in creating targeted learning goals for each individual student based on real-
time learning needs. This data informs our school's instructional plan in the following ways: the learning objectives given on 
Scantron are converted into measurable goals for ELL's with individualized Education Plans.  This data is used regularly to 
inform whole class instruction. For example, analysis of Scantron Language Arts showed us that one of our ELL’s weakest area 
in Language Arts is Sentence Structure. We next looked for instructional objectives based on the student’s current learning 
level and received the following Suggested Learning Objectives:    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 5-6.W.8.b/7-8.W.8.b: The learner will demonstrate knowledge of subject-verb agreement with a compound subject by 
completing a sentence.  
 4.W.3.g: The learner will edit to identify a verb tense error.  
 2-4.W.9: The learner will edit to identify incorrect word order in a sentence.  
 The learner will identify the parts of a paragraph.  
 The learner will identify an exclamatory sentence.  
  
We were then able to integrate next instructional steps into this student's learning plan.  We also shadow students, engage in 
Action Research cycles and shadow students to further assess their learning needs.  We then discuss our findings in weekly 
grade team and department meetings as we work collaboratively to address the learning needs of our English Language 
Learners.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We are able to integrate next instructional steps into this student's learning plan.  We also shadow students, engage in Action 
Research cycles and shadow students to further assess their learning needs. The data is disseminated in weekly grade team 
and department meetings as we work collaboratively to address the learning needs of our English Language Learners.  It is also 
disseminated to parents through meetings and/or parent phone calls. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Teachers look at growth through assessments such as Scantron EdPerformance, NYC performance tasks, and anchor projects. 
Teacher also meet weekly in both departments and grade teams as well as in smaller groups to discuss the student growth in 
relation to various metrics.   Teacher teams use the New Teacher Center protocols for looking at student work, as well as 
cycles of student shadowing, lesson studies, case studies and  action research projects to routinely assess and modify 
instructional programs.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Department Teams, grade teams and individual teachers work together with the support of the ENL teacher to implement 
appropriate interventions. Information is disseminated during weekly professional development, and grade/department team 
meetings. The data is used to implement new structures in the classroom that support the individual skills the students are 
struggling with.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We service grades 9-12  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across the NYSESLAT reveal that most of our ELL students are scoring between the emerging and expanding 
proficiency levels. They are struggling with reading comprehension and vocabulary; these same data patterns have been 
observed  in classes across content areas and in the results of our periodic assessment tools. The regents data is used to 
identify common skills students are struggling across the the exams and then used to create targeted instruction.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teacher teams meet daily in either a grade team or department format with administrative support. The data is disseminated 
through daily department meetings, weekly professional development and grade team meetings and the teachers make 
adjustments to their daily instruction to support the skills ELL students need support with. Adjustments are made on average 
every 3 weeks, once the cycle of looking at student work has finished and supports have been implemented and evaluated.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students receive stand alone/integrated ENL services; our certified ENL teacher works in the class with the general 
education teacher on targeted instruction with ELL's.  The ENL teacher also provides daily periods of  targeted 
instruction for each student identified as an ELL.  During the stand alone period, the teacher works with students on 
language acquisition and areas of weakness, such as vocabulary and grammar.   In class students are grouped with 
mixed proficiency levels. Teachers put students in cooperative groups of High-medium, medium-low. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

For our Deaf students, ASL interpretation and ASL instruction is provided in each class.   In class students are grouped 
with mixed proficiency levels. Teachers put students in cooperative groups of High-medium, medium-low. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our scheduling programmer identifies the scheduling needs of our English Language Learners and matches their programs 
with our appropriate classes.   ELL students receive ENL support for their mandated periods per day provided by the ENL 
teacher. Our Entering students receive 540 minutes per week, our Emerging students receive 360 minutes per week, and our 
Transitioning and Emerging students receive 180 minutes per week of ENL targeted instruction.  Our Commanding students 
receive 90 minutes per week and the ENL teacher support the ENL students with classes/skills the are struggling with.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our DL program, core content program is delivered in ASL and in our free standing ENL  core content is delivered in English. 
Content is delivered by teachers who are classified as highly qualified by NCLB with support from our bilingual/ ENL 
educators.   Content area specialists also collaborate with a UFT Master Teacher, ENL Teacher and Deaf and Hard of Hearing 
teacher weekly during common plan time to plan effective instruction delivered in English and/or ASL.  A variety of 
instructional techniques are implemented with appropriate scaffolding for complex assignments in order to meet the Common 
Core Standards. The same apply for our DL program, where the instruction is given in ASL.  The ENL teacher also provides extra 
support for the ENL students in English and Math. Through the analysis of student work, the ENL teacher identifies different 
skills the students need extra supports in. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELL’s are evaluated in their native languages via extensive interviews with pedagogues who are native language 
speakers.   When we have beginning students, we utilize formative and summative assessments that are delivered in the 
native language for subjects other than English. The school has a partnership with the NYC Public Library where the students 
have access to books and Electronic books in their native language. The department and grade committees team evaluate the 
students. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction for ELL subgroups is differentiated in many ways; some of the many strategies that we use include the use of 
station learning models to target areas of need, use of online tutorial programs, such as Castle Learning to target learning 
needs, push-in support, and scaffolding along with extended time for complex assignments.   
a.  For SIFE students, we have conducted extensive interviewing in the students native language, both oral and written to 
identify the best placement for the student based on the student’s current learning levels.   The student is then placed in a 
small self- contained class for more intensive instruction.  The student is immediately immersed in classes that involve more 
visual and kinesthetic learning, with support from school staff.  The student receives additional support from our Spanish 
bilingual Special Education teacher or ENL Teacher.  A continuous dialogue is maintained with families to update families on 
student progress.   Families are also connected with American Sign Language resources and courses to help them facilitate a 
dialogue with their children.  Instruction is differentiated by the content, ENL, Deaf and Hard of hearing  and speech teacher 
(when applicable) during weekly meetings.  
b. ELL’s in the US for less than 3 years often require more intensive support.  Plans are differentiated for individual students 
and may include additional supports such as:  one on one tutoring; additional stand alone TBE; remedial courses; additional 
intensive courses. Instruction is differentiated by the content, ENL, Deaf and Hard of hearing  and speech teacher (when 
applicable) during weekly meetings. 
c. Our developing  ELL’s receive push in TBE; the students are encouraged to communicate in English.   They receive extended 
time for assignments and additional scaffolding as necessary.  Bilingual special education teachers are made available to the 
students both before and after school for individual and small group instruction.   Our Deaf and Hard of Hearing teacher and 
ENL  teachers are very highly qualified to provide supports to our English Language Learners; they are well versed in bilingual 
education as well as special education.  Instruction is differentiated by the content, ENL, Deaf and Hard of hearing  and speech 
teacher (when applicable) during weekly meetings. 
d. Our long term ELL’s receive individualized plans.   We use assessment data as well as student and parent interviews to 
identify areas of struggle.   We then create programs that target those identified challenges.  Grade level teacher teams in 
conjunction with our TBE staff maintain constant contact regarding student progress.  Instruction is differentiated by the 
content, ENL, Deaf and Hard of hearing  and speech teacher (when applicable) during weekly meetings. 
e.   ELL’s who  have reach proficiency  still receive  .5 unit of study per week of integrated ENL in one of their core content area 
classes. They also receive an intensive remediation coursework in subject areas in which they are not successful. All Ell 
students receive extended time for all exams.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 All of our TBE staff are also certified special education teachers; they are well versed in working with students with disabilities 
as well as English Language Learners.   Some specific DOE systems that we use to assess and address individual needs 
include:   Scantron Edperformance Series, IO Skedula assessments, DYO assessments and Castle Learning tutorial program. 
ELL's have access to laptop use during class instruction, graphic organizers, vocabulary banks, and differentiated reading 
material to help with their language development.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 Part of our is to provide students with the least restrictive environment. Staff are trained in the implementation of IEP 
recommendations and mandates. Our programming is created by reviewing student transcripts along with multiple data 
sources simultaneously to identify the most appropriate courses and resources for students.  Staff participate regularly in 
professional learning and reading to assist them in creating and maintaining heterogeneous classroom structures that meet 
the needs of a diverse population of learners.       
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  
Emerging- Expanding English language learners receive tutoring both before and after school in math, ELA, science, and 
history. The targeted intervention programs for ELL's in these areas include a double period of ELA and/or Math for 9th grade 
ELL students. 
- Specialized class for at risk ELL 10-12 grade students 
- Department-wide lesson study 
- Departmental use of Readers and Writers Workshops’ 
- RTI Interventions in place for ELL students with IEP’s 
             - Prescriptive lessons incorporating UDL, DOK and Common Core Curriculum 
             - Kagan Cooperative Learning strategies to increase problem solving strategies 
- Strategies are implemented in conjunction with Action Research incorporating NTC tools for student work analysis 
  Additionally, if the school finds that the students are not succeeding in a particular subject, they are placed in small 
remediation courses which are supplemental to their core classes.    
Examples of remediation courses include a small 4 semester Algebra course which dedicates time weekly to intensive 
computer based tutorial instruction.  Another course is a document based research class which is taught by a master teacher 
focusing on both the writing process and social studies content.  
All intervention services are in English and ASL. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, across content areas courses, there will be an increase  in vocabulary that every class will target. 
Targeting vocabulary will help our ELL's perform better in the classroom and it will also help increase their SAT scores, which 
will help them become college and career ready.    We will also target analysis of text across the core content areas of ELA, 
History, Math and Science. During department and grade team meetings, teachers will use the New Teacher Center analysis of 
student work protocol to identify specific skills/needs that  ENL students have. They will then use the data to plan targeted 
instruction.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We have several staff  members  that are proficient in Spanish; bilingual adults are also available at all events. We have an  ENL 
teacher who meets with students weekly as well as provides support to other pedagogues who have ELL's in their classrooms. 
When an event occurs in the evening or during the weekend, per session is offered or interpreters are hired to ensure 
equitable access to language for all of our students. Some of the activities we offer after school are: ASL Club, Art Club, Coding, 
Book Club, Chess Club, Soccer, Volleyball, Cheer Leading, Basketball, Fashion and Photography Club, all which provide a 
trilingual interpreter for all meetings, practices and games.  We also have bilingual student aides, paraprofessionals, guidance 
counselor, interpreters and parent coordinator to provide access to families and students. The school invites ELL's by sending 
home , posting notices around the school, daily announcements and emails in their native or preferred language.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We use instructional technology to support ELL’s. We have SMART Boards in all classrooms, 3 computer labs and three laptop 
carts.   We also have video cameras and editing technology along with several books and software programs that support ENL 
instruction. Our ENL teacher has an instructional library with multiple resources that teachers can use to support their ELL 
students.   In addition, teacher use systems like News ELA, IO Skedula and other computer based programs to make material 
accessible to students.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is provided in the Dual Language classes by Sign Language interpreters. Our non-Deaf ELL students 
access material in their native language through our partnership with the NYC Public library, which allows students to rent 
books and e-books in their native language. Our online assessment program also has options for students to get translated 
work when needed.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

As a high school we assess students using grade level appropriate materials.  From the students' previous NYSESLAT scores, we 
are able to assess the different levels of each student and teachers are able to differentiate their lessons with that data, and 
data collected from Scantron and MOSL assessments. We use ATS reports to check information such as age.  The ENL teacher 
and the Assistant Principal review all required services/resources.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The ENL teachers from all schools meet to discuss different skills, resources and techniques they use with the students. Our 
ENL teacher has an instructional library with multiple resources that teachers can use to support their ENL students.   The ENL 
teacher also collaborates with the school social worker to help implement strategies for students social emotional needs.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Activities that our school offers to assist newly enrolled ENL students before the beginning of the school year include a 
summer bridge program and 9th grade orientation. During these programs there is at least one content teacher for each 
subject and the ENL teacher there to support. ELL's who enroll throughout the year attend after school tutoring and receive 
extra support during lunch by the ENL teacher. The school counselor also provides students and parents information for 
outside organizations that help support new ENL students.   All students attend an open school day and receive a tour of our 
building with their parents by the Assistant principal, ENL teacher, guidance counselor and student volunteers.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Part of the mission of our school is to educate students in the use of American Sign Language.  As such, ASL is the only 
language offered during the school day.  However, through the College Now program,  we have partnerships with Baruch 
College and LaGuardia College. Students can elect to take additional foreign language classes at the college level  for free, and 
can be awarded college credit through our partnership. Additionally, we offer the foreign language LOTE,  such as Spanish, to 
interested students.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Deaf students receive 100% instruction in ASL.  
 Students in the dual language program spend 85% of their day in Dual language classes.  
 Language is not separated for the Deaf students.  
 "47" uses the side by side Dual language model.  
 Both languages are taught simultaneously.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  The school has an ENL teacher that helps provide all teachers with the supports they need to help their ELL students. There is 
one to one coaching done by the ENL teacher for all staff that teach ELL students, including the assistant principals and the 
principal. All teachers receive extensive training in the implementation and scoring of the NYSESLAT exam. All staff including 
assistant principals and the principal also receive off site training provided by the Department of Education such as using data 
to drive instruction for ELL’s and content specific workshops offered by the DOE. The ENL teacher also attends DOE ELL training 
at least three times a year. Guidance counselors and non-instructional staff, receive Professional Learning from the ENL 
teacher in the beginning of the school year, and any time throughout the school year as needed; these PD's focus on topics 
such as communicating with ELL's and their guardians,  as well as social interventions.          
All content area teachers attend content specific professional learning, targeted towards increasing ELL performance in those 
target subject areas. Also all content teachers have been sent to NYCDOE  Common Core PD training. Some of the PD's offered 
to teachers are: using graphic organizers with ELL's, how to build vocabulary, differentiated instruction for ELL's, using Castle 
Learning with ELL's in the classroom. All Professional Development is aligned with Common Core Standards. Professional 
development will take place once a month. It will start with an introduction to ENL and then they will be monthly PD's on 
strategies teachers need supports in. We will identify these strategies through student formative and summative data.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers receive professional development on site and with the DOE. The PD's take place on Mondays during professional 
development and during department and grade team meetings. Some of the PDs offered using graphic organizers with ELL's, 
how to build vocabulary, language acquisition,reading workships, Differentiated instruction for ELL's, using Castle Learning and 
IO Skedula with ELLs in the classroom. All PDs are aligned with common core standards. Records of the professional 
development activities are kept in our internal electronic system.  Staff is supported on-site, as needed, the guidance 
counselor attends off-site PD's that focus on various areas, such as college and career readiness and transition from  middle to 
high school and from high school to college and/or career.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher sets up a mandated meeting during the fall and winter months. During these meeting, the ENL teachers 
speaks to the parents/guardians about student goals, assessment results and action research plans that teachers will use to 
guide instruction for the student. Parents who are not able to attend these meetings, have a phone conference with the ENL 
teacher to discuss the topics. Parents are shown the different things that their children are working on and are given different 
supports for parents to help their children at home. Interpreters and translated materials are requested in advance for parent 
meetings and phone conferences.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We have an on site Parent Coordinator,  Assistant Principal, and ENL Coordinator who work to increase parent involvement. 
The parent coordinator ensures that parents have received all the information of the activities in their preferred 
language.  Since we are not a community school and our students travel from the five boroughs, our parent involvement is 
typically low.  We email parents weekly, as well as send out monthly newsletters highlighting our monthly parent workshops,

school calendar and school events. Parents also communicate with us through our online communication system called 
Teacher Ease.  Parents are contacted anytime students are absent or late. The school also offers an ASL after school program 
for parents, there is also a monthly Breakfast with the Principal, in which the Principal and families share and convey 
information. Interpreters are available in every meeting and/or after school program.  Parent engagement session focused on 
ENL will happen six times a year, three in the Fall and three in the Spring. Topics will focus on: supporting ELL students at 
home, cultural celebrations, and parent based needs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Watfa Shama, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parent information sheets are distributed at the beginning of the school year to all students. The form asks 
parents to specify their preferred language for oral and written communication. We also use the adult preferred 
language report (RAPL) from ATS, parent surveys and student surveys collected by teachers.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

How does 
your school 

plan to 
provide 

interpretation 

service(s)?  

September 2017  We contract 
with NYCDOE 
to provide 
interpretation 
services 

We meet parents face to face for conferences six times per year. 
Interpreters are formally requested two weeks in advance. 
Attendance meetings, IEP meetings, Promotion in Doubt meetings 
and disciplinary meetings are scheduled as needed. We arrange for 
interpreters/translators as soon as we have a date. For informal 
meetings, we use the translators/interpreters in the school building. 
Our guidance counselor speaks Spanish and is familiar with the use of 
video phones for Deaf Parents. In the event that the attendance 
teacher needs to visit a Deaf, Mandarin, Arabic or Spanish-speaking 
home, an interpreter is requested in advance.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We will use video phones, text messaging, our website and our web-based CNXT app in addition to email and phone 
calls. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Through weekly meetings and professional learning updates 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

We have 7 full time ASL interpreters and staff members that are fluent in Spanish and Arabic. In the event that a 
parent requires a language other than the ASL, Spanish or Arabic we call the Office of Interpreting Services and 
request a translator or interpreter. In addition, most official notices and templates are available from the DOE on the 
intranet site of the Office of Translation and Interpretation.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We use electronic and paper-based parent surveys. We also have a focus group of parents, who represent all cultures 
& languages represented at our school. The group meets once a month with the Principal and they provide feedback 
regarding the quality and availability of interpretation services.
