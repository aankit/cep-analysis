Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We believe students achieve success and embrace learning when there is trust, a supportive environment, 
collaboration, and rigorous instruction.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Meyer Levin IS 285 is a performing arts middle school located in the East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York servicing 
students in grades six through eight. The student body has the following demographic breakdowns: 1% White, 4% 
Hispanic, 95% Black and 0% Asian. The school has qualified for Title I funding for the past five years and has utilized 
this funding as a School Wide Program to support the learning of the entire student body. 

 

This school is unique in that it serves as a borough-wide admission school for families who live throughout the 
designated area, but also has a screened application process. For example, students who excel academically are 
admitted in the Astral and Magnet program. This program is for the academically gifted, where the curriculum 
includes Regents courses in Algebra, Living Environment and U.S. History. In addition, students are mandated to 
audition for the Magnet Performing Arts program. It exposes students and allows them to participate in various 
aspects of show production, from set design to lighting and sound. Students may audition to be in drama, dance, steel 
pan, instrumental band, and chorus. In addition to the Astral and Magnet program, the school has the general 
academic program that offers the full array of services for all students, including English language learners and 
students with special needs. IS 285 prides itself on servicing students of all academic levels and works diligently to 
meet the needs of all of its students. 

 

Meyer Levin exposes students' to rigorous instruction in the core content areas while supplementing the arts, 
technology, language, and physical education curriculum. Our curriculum is focused on the development of the whole 
child and is emphasized through the balance of rigorous content and engaging enrichment classes that allow students 
to cultivate their interests and aptitudes in all areas of learning. Our extensive after school program also provides 
students with opportunities to experience rich extracurricular activities in academics and performing arts. At Meyer 
Levin, we are committed to developing lifelong learners and civic-minded individuals who will contribute to the 
community. The staff at Meyer Levin work tirelessly with students to create a safe learning environment where all 
members of the school community are welcomed and respected. 

 

In order to provide our students with high quality educational opportunities, we are in partnership with the following 
Community Based Organizations: Sports and Arts Foundation, Urban Advantage Program, Medgar Evers Science and 
Technology Entry Program, Interboro Counseling Program, Ifetayo Cultural Arts Academy, East-Flatbush Village, 
Higher Levin, Prime Time Basketball, and Why Not Now Mentorship Program. The Sports and Arts program offer our 
students an after school program rich in academics and arts. This program offers our students academic intervention, 
academic enrichment, homework help, and international learning tours abroad. Urban Advantage allows our teachers 
to engage in professional development at various science institutions (Hall of Science, Museum of Natural History, NY, 
Brooklyn and Queens Botanical Gardens, Bronx and Staten Island Zoo and the NY Aquarium) throughout the city 
allowing them to utilize the institutions to connect classroom learning to real world examples. The Medgar Evers STEP 
involves our staff and students in robotics, gaming and other education enrichment work related to the targeted 
fields of science, technology and medicine.  

 

This school received a Proficient on it’s most recent quality review. Our learning community believes in rigorous 
instruction, horizontal and vertical alignment and the commitment to ensuring that all learners will have access to the 
curriculum. We have achieved this by consistently assessing students and using the results from the assessments to 
improve teaching and learning. This school has a culture where collaboration amongst the staff has helped develop 
precise curriculum, assessments and the ongoing review of student progress. Time is allotted into each teacher’s

programs to ensure that they are able to work with and across grade levels. Our school’s organizational structure also 
allows for greater knowledge of students.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Meyer Levin I.S. 285 serves a diverse population of students which includes: 

Students with disabilities - learning disabilities, autism, hearing impaired, visually impaired, ADHD 
 
  English Language Learners (ELL) - whose first languages are Italian, Arabic, Haitian-Creole, Spanish 
  Economically Disadvantaged - students that are eligible for free or reduced-priced meals, low income, 

students in temporary housing and children of immigrant parents from the Caribbean.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

a) Collaborative Teachers and Trust are elements of the Framework in which our school has made the most progress 
over the past year.  

 

b) Our key area of focus for this school year is Rigorous Instruction. This year our primary focus is to integrate new 
approaches, including explicitly explaining strategies, modeling specific strategies, followed by guided instruction, 
cooperative work and then independent work. Staples in our instructional approach are engaging students and 
creating more opportunities for student to student interactions within the classrooms. Research has shown that one 
of the best ways that students learn is when conversing with other students or giving a demonstration. At Meyer 
Levin we will closely monitor the implementation of this practice to assess its impact on student learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
ELA  

Strengths:  

(Will be update when 2017-18 state assessment results are posted) 

Literacy" is emphasized across the content areas. 

 
  The ELA state test results indicates that our "performance index" increased significantly from last school year 
state test results to this year results. The "performance index" also indicates that overall we went from 108.3 
to 111.478. 

  Our general education students according to the performance index went from 118.7 in 2015-16 to 120.935 

in 2016-2017. In addition, our IEP students increased in from 47.31 in 2015-16 to 55.422 in 2016-2017; 
Limited English Proficient Students went from 50.0 in 2015-16 to 60.0 in 2016-2017; Economical 
Disadvantaged students went from 107.6 in 2015-16 to 109.812 in 2016-2017. Consequently, according to the 
performance index, when it comes to all students, the school moved from a 108.3 to 111.478. 

  An increase over the past two years on state assessment in the following standards for grade 8 students: 

 

RI.8.1, 8.2, 8.5, 8.6; RL.8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.6; grade 7 students RI.7.1, 7.2, 7.5, 7.6; RL.7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 
and 7.6 
Interim assessments are administered quarterly, common formative assessments are administered in 6-week 
intervals, as well as other forms of assessments. Results from these assessments are used to differentiate and 
drive instruction in classrooms. 

  Teachers and students have access to cultural relevant novels and/or trade books. We have a plethora of 

literacy materials and resources, including Codex, Rally, and IReady. In addition, for the 2018-19 school year, 
students are provided with new text books in science and social studies. 

  Teachers are provided with on-going professional development throughout the 2018-19 school year that 
focuses on Domain 1 and Domain 3, and close reading strategies. This will enable horizontal and vertical 
alignment throughout the various content areas  

  Teachers conducted and completed inter-visitation cycles with two other schools within the district. The focus 

was on high quality questioning and discussion and student engagement. 

  Curriculum units and lesson plans are fully aligned to the Common Core Standards 
 

Intervention and support system are in place to assist in teaching and learning. For example, the Instructional 
Coach visits classroom and models effective strategies in ELA.

Strengths:  

(Will be updated when 2017-18 state assessment results come in) 

  We made significant progress according to the performance index in grade 8.  
 
  Our students with disabilities, had an increase of progress of 3 percentage points. 

In grades 6 and 7, many of our low level 1s moved to high level 1s and our low level 2s to high level 2s. 

 

Weaknesses  

  The "performance index" also indicates that according to the state test scores, the school performance in 

math decreased. 

  The performance index indicates a decrease in overall performance of all students. 
 
  A significant amount of our IEP students are performing at level 1 in mathematics.  

In 2015-16 our PI score was 67.2; In 2016-17 our score dropped to 67.1. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths 

According to the NYC school survey, we are 8% points above the city average in supporting environment (we scored 
an above average) 

  Because we understand the challenges teachers face in the classroom, we continuously provide high quality 

 

professional development in various academic areas. 
Last school year, teachers received training in Restorative Practices. Over the summer, selected teachers 
receive addition trainings in Restorative Practices. 

  Workshops are offered to staff members in an effort to support instructional practices. 
  New Materials for teachers and students in math, ELA, and science. 
  Common planning ie is built in to the teacher's schedule so that they can meet consistently to discuss 

academic endeavors. 

  Collaborative Inquiry team was created last year and will continue this year with an ultimate goal to improve 

the academic performance of students 

  Teachers collaborate to create Unit Plans as exemplified in our end of the year (2016-2017) unit, Juneteeth 

Project. 
Library books and class sets of books were purchased to support our literacy efforts 

 
  Their is on-going communication with staff members through the principals' open door policy, monthly 

faculty meetings, email correspondence, and memos. 

  Principal is visible in all classrooms and consistently covers classes for absent teachers. This is so that many 

staff members do not miss their preps. 

  Teachers have access to their own copy machine. 
  Part of the improvement plan is to develop other pedagogues thorough inter-visitation. 
  We are in partnership with other district schools to develop staff members in Domain 3b and 3c. 
  There is strong collaboration between the school community. We received an above average score of 92% on 

the school survey in the category of trust. 

  Common core aligned Curriculum was purchased in math and Science, 
 

School utilizes a positive behavioral intervention system to reinforce positive behavior and realign negative 
behavior 

  Mentorship program for boys and girls to redirect students with consistent behavioral problems 
  Celebratory events such as dances, Honor Roll assemblies, Science Fairs, Winter, Spring and Black History 

Concerts, Performing Arts Showcases and Awards Nights are used to celebrate student progress

To improve Student Performance in Mathematics as evident on the State Math Exam and other Common Formative 
Assessments as well as: 

  Provide student who need additional time and support to become proficient 
 

Identify teachers who help students achieve at high levels so team members can examine those teacher’s 
practice and visit their classrooms. 
Identify teachers who struggle to help students become proficient so team members can assist in addressing 
the problem. 
Identify skills or concepts that none of the teachers were able to help students achieve at the intended level 
so the team can expand its learning beyond its members to become more effective in teaching those skills 
and concepts. 

 

 

  Creating a coordinated intervention plan that ensures that students who struggle receive additional time and 

support for learning in a way that is timely, directive, diagnostic, precise, and most important systematic. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

 

 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. I.S. 285 Meyer Levin, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.  

 

The school's policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate in the school community 
such as School Leadership Team, Parent Teacher Association, Restorative Practice, Title I Parent Committee, and 
Individualized Education Program (IEP). Meyer Levin, IS 285 support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child's progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

The school's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school's Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school's Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school's 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school's Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school's Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In order to access student's early literacy skills an IRI (Informal Reading Inventory) is used to measure the student's 
instructional reading level.  Based on the results of the data teachers are able to identify student's needs and provide support 
services accordingly. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

The aforementioned program plan being achieved, the ELLs enrolled in the co-teaching  program at I.S. 285 will achieve a high 
English proficiency level, which will be evidenced by their score on the upcoming spring 2018 NYSESLAT exam. Students will 
score at or above the grade level on the standardized city and state content area test as well.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data results from the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) results directly influence 
the instruction of skills that need to be reinforced through instruction in the ELL program. Through analyzing the past 
NYSESLAT data – it is evident that the sixth grade students are able to reach expanding or commanding levels in writing and 
speaking much faster than that of reading and listening skills.  Based on the data, seventy percent of the sixth and eighth grade 
students were able to reach expanding or commanding language levels in each of the modalities, however their total 
combined raw scale score did not reach that of the commanding requirement.  This data directly implements class grouping 
and instruction – and allows the teacher to see how students tend to progress in one modality over another. The students, 
who take the NYSITELL and LAB-R exams, tend to prominently score at the beginning level of language learning. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

One unit of study in ENL is implemented by a K-12 certified ESOL teacher as a Stand-Alone model for entering and 
emerging Ell's.  For Entering, Emerging Transitioning, and Expanding Ell's, one unit of Integrated ENL is implemented 
bya certified ESOL teacher and a K-6 certified elementary school teacher.   
         For Entering, Emerging Transitioning, and Expanding Ell's, one unit of Integrated ENL is implemented by a 
certified ESOL teacher and a 7-8 certified content area teacher (ELA,Math, Science, or Social Studies)  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

                              For Entering, Emerging Transitioning, and Expanding Ell's, one unit of Integrated ENL is implemented bya 
certified ESOL teacher and      a K-6 certified elementary school teacher.   
         For Entering, Emerging Transitioning, and Expanding Ell's, one unit of Integrated ENL is implemented bya certified ESOL 
teacher and a 7-8 certified content area teacher (ELA,Math, Science, or Social Studies) Paste response to questions here:    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                ELL students attend mainstream classes in their core content area subjects. These classes are taught in English and 
the teacher of these classes work with the ESL teacher/ coordinator in order to best differentiate instruction and meet the 
language needs for their students. Students will receive content area based instruction through the use of scaffolding with 
authentic texts and resources. Students will be taught to use bilingual glossaries and materials in order to aid their overall 
comprehension of the content. ELLs will receive time and a half on mainstream classroom test at the discretion of the 
teacher.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                The R-LAB is administered when Spanish-speaking ELLs are first admitted into the NYC school system. This tool helps 
teachers determine language skills in Spanish. The student's performance on the Spanish LAB helps the ESL teachers to better 
understands his/her native language academic background and schooling skills. If applicable, the SIFE Oral Interview 
Questionnaire is also used to further collect data on the student's schooling history. The information collected from the R-LAB 
and other assessments on the student's first language is utilized by the ESL and subject teachers when planning instruction and 
group work. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Parents of students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) will have the option to enroll their student in the ESL program at 
I.S. 285 or accept a reference to a school with a bilingual or native language program. If parents choose I.S. 285 for their child’s 
education – students will receive accommodations based on their initial needs defined through appropriate assessment. 
Students may be pul led from mainstream classes to ensure they are receiving the necessary resources and services available. 
Through this, it can be ensured that the student is able to work to his or her ability in their regularly scheduled program of 
classes. In order to ensure students are emerged in a college ready curriculum and adhering to the NCLB – all students who 
have been in the country for one year or more are required to participate in the appropriate ELA state testing. Preparation for 
this exam is regularly incorporated into the daily curriculum of the students. Furthermore, students will be given rigorous test 
taking preparation opportunity – before, during and after school - in order to prepare the students. Lastly, students will 
participate in the schools Uniform Assessments – which mirror the ELA exam - as well as practice ELA test and Periodic 
Assessment which allow teacher to gather data to drive instruction. ELLs who receive services for 4 to 6 year will be closely 
evaluated and have their attendance, effort and mainstream class grades closely monitored to ensure that a comprehensive 
approach to their education is being followed. This will in turn enable the students to score proficient on the NYSESLAT exam 
and perform well on assessments that their mainstream peers participate in. Lastly, these students will also be involved in 
SMART goal setting, which encourages them to make progress and personally accountable for academic growth. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Long-term ELLs, who have been in the NYC school system for six or more year, will attend the aforementioned extended day 
program and early extra help services to receive the needed support services. They also will have the option to participate in 
the after school reading and math intervention programs to ensure they are receiving the needed academic help. Again, 
SMART goal setting will be utilized to encourage them to make progress and be held accountable for academic growth.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs with special needs will receive the needed academic support though close attention to their IEP’s. The ELL 
teacher/coordinator works closely with the parents and support service provided to ensure that student is meeting their goals 
and receiving the best accommodations. If additional accommodations are noticed, these will be immediately provided after 
consulting with a guardian or parent. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In order to ensure the academic success of the I.S. 285 ELL population, the ELL coordinator/teacher and content area teacher 
work closely together to make certain that instruction is differentiated for all language learners. I.S. 285 provides an academic 
intervention program that aids students in enhancing their literacy skills in both Math and ELA and other content areas. This 
enables teacher to work closely with students to address and instruct specific skills that the student is in need of. The Saturday 
Academy program reinforces the same core curriculum skills. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

I.S. 285 provides “breakout classes” which allow ELL students to excel in the visual and performing arts, technology and hobby 
courses outside of their academic contents. Students are able to take classes ranging from Chorus, Computer Technology to 
Health and Fitness – that allows them to interact with their mainstream peers and expand on their language skills outside of 
the typical classroom. These programs will continue for the next year, and have room to grow with the current selections.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
There are no programs/services for ELLs that will be discontinued.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
I.S. 285 offers ELL students targeted intervention program that includes enrollment in the Sports and Art Foundation After 
School Program, Afterschool Academic Intervention Program, and Hour of Power. ELLs who have IEP's may also be scheduled 
for one 46 minute period of resource room to supplement a specific skill or subject area. As needed, if an ELL student needs a 
more restrictive special education environment, while continuing language services, this is available as well.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Resources and instructional material are always available to ELL students. ELL students have a vast variety of content area text 
books (ELA and Math), as well as a classroom library with a variety of leveled works and genres. The library has a collection of 
works, level reading series, phonics based selections, bilingual dictionaries, thesauruses, glossaries, and educational 
magazines. Students also have laptop computers, online resources for home and school, computer software and listening 
centers readily available to them. The goal of these resources is to overall aid the student in making content comprehensible 
and enriching, while also enhancing the language development in ELLs. here:    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ELL students are encouraged to speak and keep up literacy skills in their native language. There is a clear connection between 
strong literacy skills in the home language to that of the English language. Students are permitted to use their native language 
with peers in order to facilitate comprehension of material and to build a bridge toward English language acquisition. During 
instruction, no explicit native speaking occurs in the Freestanding ELL program 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services support and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. All novels, informational texts and 
computer-based resources selected and implemented in class are at middle school level of complexity and student interest. 
Were the school to enroll older ELLs, the school would purchase appropriate materials suited to these students.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Resources and instructional material are always available to ELL students. ELL students have a vast variety of content area text 
books (ELA and Math), as well as a classroom library with a variety of leveled works and genres. The library has a collection of 
works, level reading series, phonics based selections, bilingual dictionaries, thesauruses, glossaries, and educational magaz 
ines. Students also have laptop computers, online resources for home and school, computer software and listening centers 
readily available to them. The goal of these resources is to overall aid the student in making content comprehensible and 
enriching, while also enhancing the language development in ELLs. here:    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In order to ease the transition in a new school setting, newly enrolled ELLs who arrive during the school year will be paired 
with a student who speaks their native language. This “buddy student” will help the new ELL student transition into the school 
environment and mainstream classroom. Students will be paired together in the ELL classroom as well – in order to create a 
comfortable environment for the new Ell students so that effective language learning and can take place. Newly enrolled ELL 
students will more than likely be pulled from mainstream classroom to provide extra language support and facilitate language 
acquisition. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

When scheduling permits, ELL students have the opportunity to take a course in Spanish.  This course would serve as a middle 
school language elective.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
In order to better accommodate the ELL population of students at I.S. 285 the ESL teacher - a fully licensed and certified 
teacher – will work closely with the other content area teachers. Content area teachers will participate in ongoing staff 
development sessions that clarify and teach skills and strategies, such as differentiated instruction and scaffolding, that will 
ultimately have a positive impact on the social and academic achieve of the ELL student. The ELL teacher regularly meets with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

and discusses the progress of an ELL student with content area teachers. The ELL teacher will attend weekly team meetings in 
the various contents (which collaborate together three or more times a week) in order to be aware of the current 
expectations, content and overall lessons that are occurring in the mainstream classroom. Further, detailed cu rriculum maps 
from all content areas (ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies) are readily available thro ugh I.S. 285's collaborative network on 
Shutterfly. This allows the ESL teacher to develop and differentiate instruction for the language learners – and keep them in 
line with the curriculum of their mainstream peers. Overall collaborations between all staff members and administrators is an 
integral component of the academic success of the ELL population at I.S. 285. Teachers share a variety of materials, as some 
ESL material and strategies prove to be effective in helping a range of students – particularly non ELLs struggling with Literacy 
skills. Mainstream and content rich materials aligned with the Common Core Standards also provide the needed academic 
rigor by which ELLs can achieve English progress faster. Bilingual teachers, paraprofessional, and other support services are 
made available to the school community. If parents and students prefer to speak Spanish, French or Haitian Creole - these 
mentioned staff members offer support to the non English speaking population. As needed, translations services and resources 
are made available to parent. They are provided with links and internet resources to the translation services provided by the 
New York City Department of Education. ELL students who are currently in the 8th grade are provided with the support to 
transition and choose their high school for the following school year. They will meet with guidance counselors and the ELL 
teacher on an individual basis in order to make a high school selection and have assistance with the overall high school 
selection process. ELLs in grade six regularly interact with peers of higher grades due to the mix of a language based classroom 
– opposed to grade based. This allows students to make an easier transition grade to grade. Content area teachers and 
administrators provide support as well to all ELL students as needed. With the emergence of the Common Core Standards in 
the curriculum – changes in standards and material have and will be taking place in order to serve ELLs. The ELL teacher is 
regularly informed and attends workshops in order to relay information to teachers who have not met their 7.5 hours of ELL 
training. The ELL teacher serves as a resource of knowledge for teacher in instructing and addressing the ELL population. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
   

 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, George Patterson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use a variety of methods to obtain the data to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and 
timely information in a language they can understand. The primary resource is the Home Language Aggregation 
Report in ATS. This report provides the breakdown of languages by grade of all the students.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

During staff meetings and common planning time meetings we will discuss the goal of A-663 and discuss resources 
that are available. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Students registering to the school have to complete a Home Language Identification Survey which is collected and fed 
into the Home Language Report. Whenever possible the nine most common primary languages other than English is 
adhered in the lobby as well as the main office to offer parents the opportunity to identify the language they speak so 
that we may be able to further assist them. If a written or oral translator is available amongst our in-house staff, we 
certainly make use of their expertise. In situations where this may not be the case, an external vendor is used to 
provide the translation services. These services are provided upon request of the parent at any meetings or scheduled 
visits to the school building.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will use in-house parent surveys periodically throughout the year as well as review the end of year and the 
summative parent survey distributed by the city.
