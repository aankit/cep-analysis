Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 
M.S. 88 is a three-year, Title I School-wide (6-8) middle school located in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. We are 
a comprehensive middle school divided into small learning communities of lifelong learners who will experience 
success by receiving personalized attention that remains beyond the scope of traditional schools. 

 

We have created an environment that allows all students to respect themselves and their abilities. Our aim is to 
give all students the necessary emotional and academic support to build their self-esteem by setting high 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

expectations that will lead to a sense of personal responsibility. M.S. 88 is strategically aligned with major 
universities, along with public and private companies to support teacher development and enrich the learning 
experiences of our students. 
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

M.S. 88 has three themed houses that offer students the opportunity to pursue their individual interests and 
personalize their learning. 

The School for Integrated Studies Through the Arts (SISTA) offers students the opportunity to learn through an 
integrated curriculum that includes literacy, mathematics, social studies and science with a strong emphasis on the 
performance, visual and dramatic arts. The first goal of SISTA is for students to acquire critical thinking and 
processing skills. These skills incorporate logic, reasoning and problem solving, comprehension, inferring, authentic 
research, inquiry-based learning, experimentation and cooperative group work. Focus is placed on the integration 
of reading and writing strategies into all subject areas. The arts will be a motivating force that creates opportunities 
for active and meaningful learning as students acquire those basic skills. Once students acquire critical thinking and 
processing skills, they proceed to the second goal of SISTA. This goal is the application of skills and knowledge 
through project-based learning led by interdisciplinary and collaborative teaching. Performance, dramatic and 
visual arts will remain the underlying focus to support all projects in a variety of ways. Teachers will plan and 
integrate units of study using the Arts as a medium of student expression and to provide meaningful, authentic 
learning. The culminating goal of SISTA is for students to apply the skills and knowledge they have acquired to 
produce projects, dramatic performances and exhibits that feature literary publications and art presentations 
spanning the subject areas. 

Students in the School for Media Arts and Technology (SMART) House will become well versed in using tools of 
communication including computers, scanners, and both digital and video cameras. They will prepare for a career 
in graphic arts, animation or graphic design. Some opportunities that SMART HOUSE students will have include: 

Interning with graphic arts designers 

Studying the history of media 

 
  Creating and archiving records, videotapes, and broadcasts of school-wide events 
 
  Participating in research and robot design as part of the First Lego League Robotics team 
  Publishing a school newspaper and senior magazine 
  A SMART House student is a focused learner who uses technology to enhance the learning experience. 

The Medical and Health Careers House offers students the opportunity to learn through an integrated curriculum 
that includes literacy, mathematics, social studies, and science with a strong emphasis on science and health 
awareness. Additionally, STEM learning is embedded throughout the curriculum through the use of our state-of-
the-art science labs, which are equipped to provide student with project-based learning centered on bio-medical 
concepts. The first goal of Medical is for students to acquire critical thinking and process skills. These skills 
incorporate logic, reasoning, and problem solving, as well as comprehension, inferring, authentic research, inquiry 
based learning, experimentation and cooperative group work. Focus is placed on the integration of reading and 
writing strategies into all subject areas. The health curriculum will be a motivating force that creates opportunities 
for active and meaningful learning as students acquire both basic skills, and higher order thinking skills. Once 
students acquire skills, they proceed to the next goal of Medical. This goal is the application of skills and knowledge 
through project-based learning led by interdisciplinary, collaborative teaching. Participation in partnerships with 
community-based organizations will foster an environment that allows for the application of these skills. The 
culminating goal of the Medical House is for students to apply the skills and knowledge they have acquired to 
produce projects, and participate in internships with community hospitals and health facilities. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We have always had a large population of students with disabilities, and have met their diverse needs with an 
extensive toolbox of resources. Over one third of our classes are ICT, and we have students in the 12:1 self-
contained, ACES program and SETSS services. Dynamic Learning Maps with Essential Elements and learning targets 
are designed for the ACES program to bridge from grade-level content standards to academic expectations for 
students with cognitive disabilities. Similarly, with our other SwD populations, the Universal Design for Learning 
model provides multiple entry points for all learners, and choice for student work products. 

Our English Language Learner population is just over 15% of the school population and ranges from newcomers 
who enroll when they arrive in the country to students who are born in the United States. Many of our ELLs are 
long term ELLs, some of whom also have an IEP. About two-thirds of our students are former ELLs who speak their 
family’s home language. Language support is provided in classroom across content areas with through language 
objectives and intervention programs before, during, and after school. 

In revising and improving our ELA, math, science and social studies curricula, we paid particular attention to the 
learning needs of ELLs, SWDs and struggling learners. Our efforts have resulted in significant academic gains by 
students in the subgroups through innovative teaching models of personalized, blended learning and project-based 
learning with application of skills to solve real-life scenarios. An emphasis on formative assessment ensures that 
student progress is consistently monitored, and that lesson and unit plans are revised to ensure growth in our ELLs 
and SwDs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

1.  Based on a review of the past two years of Common Core aligned state assessment data, we anticipate 

increasing our proficiency rates in 2017-18. The data for 2016-2017 is: 

  Proficiency in ELA -Overall: 44% 
  Proficiency in Math - Overall: 36 %  

This reflects a 9% growth in ELA and 0% growth in Math from 2015-2016. 

According to data from the 2017-18 School Quality Survey: 

  Common Core Shifts in Literacy results- 95% positive in SY 2017-18 

This reflects a +10% change from the 2016-17 school year and +2% compared to the City Average 

  Common Core Shifts in Math results- 95% positive in SY 2017-18 

This reflects a +5% change from the 2016-17 school year and +2% compared to the City Average 

On our SY2017-18 Quality Review Report, the school’s Area of Celebration was indicator 1.2 (Develop teacher 
pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts 
and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that 
all students produce meaningful work products). The school received a Well Developed rating. 

 

2. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Survey, the data reveals: 

  Quality of Student Discussion- Overall 77% positive in SY 2017-18 

This reflects a -6% change from the 2016-17 school year  

  Academic Press- Overall 68% positive in SY 2017-18 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

This reflects a -2% change from the 2016-17 school year 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, students in grades 6-8 will show an increase in the number of level 2 students achieving a level 3 or 
higher on the 2018-19 New York State ELA and Math assessments when compared to the 2017-18 NYS ELA and Math 
results. 

By June 2019, the amount of students showing proficiency on the NYS 8th grade Science exam will increase by 20% 
when compared to the 2017-18 NYS 8th grade science results.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers use various sections of the DOK wheel and LCI Criteria 
for Rigor within a lesson to cognitively challenge students, and 
cognitively challenging questions are formulated by both 
students and teachers. 

Professional Development in ELA, Math, Science, SpEd and ENL 
will have a focus of deepening teachers’ understanding of 
student-centered pedagogy that allows diverse learners to access 
content, and exhibit reasoning with high levels of student 
participation.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Staff will move toward student centered conferences that encourages all members of a family to become 
stakeholders in the learning process alongside M.S. 88 staff. In preparing students to present their work and 
problems of practice to families, our school will build the language needed for increased communication regarding 
CCSS and the Next Generation Learning Standards and ways to support work at home.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Based on a comprehensive analysis of our school population and a review of our most recent School Quality Survey 
and Quality Review, we have targeted these areas separate from our curricular focus in order to address how we can 
best utilize our partnerships and parent programs.  

 

 

1.  According to our Learning Environment Survey, 87% of the school community responded positively to survey 

questions about our Guidance department, and 85% responded positively to questions about Social-
Emotional learning at our school. Additionally, on our SY2017-18 Quality Review, the school was rated Well 
Developed around indicators 1.4 (Maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports 
the academic and personal growth of students and adults) and 3.4 (Establish a culture for learning that 
communicates high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve those 
expectations). 

M.S. 88’s commitment to social and emotional learning for all community members is foundational to ensuring a 
positive learning environment for all. Discourse with students emphasizes responsibility, choice, support, and 
encouragement. This is reflected in instructional teaching practices that center on cooperative learning, classroom 
discussions, self-assessment, and self-reflection. Teachers help students develop social and emotional skills through 
the instruction cycle with multiple entry points for students. Additionally, with professional development, all staff 
are trained in supports that create an inclusive culture and build confidence throughout our school community 

 

Our Core Values increase inclusive communication within a safe space so that everyone can express themselves 
authentically. A common language around social and emotional learning encourages relationship-building and a 
culture of respect and understanding throughout the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
1.  Goals for the school are layered into feedback to teachers. Teacher support is customized for teachers’ 
individual professional goals with and offers next steps to grow teacher capacity. The three components 
addressed in teachers development plans that include support in content, student centered practice, and 
leadership development and adult learning. This work is completed by teachers through an inquiry lens. 

 

 

According to the 2017-18 School Quality Survey, our school has shown grown in Cultural Awareness and 
Inclusive Classroom Instruction (89% positive response), Quality of Professional Development (79% positive 
response) and School Commitment (90% positive response). Teachers regularly receive feedback that 
addresses strengths, areas of improvement and next steps using language from the Danielson rubric in 
combination with pedagogical best practices. Leadership is leveled to ensure strategic and transparent 
systems to ensure teachers always know where to get support and our efforts are aligned.  

 

Along with administration and coaches, teacher leaders at the grade and department level have built a culture 
of collaboration that has resulted in coherence and cohesion in units of study within and across content, and 
cohesion of strong instructional practices to engage all learners by using data and protocols for studying 
student work to identify and address student learning gaps. Year-on-year, the teacher collaboration and 
inquiry has led to an increase in student achievement as indicated by rising scores on the state Math and ELA 
and ELA. 

 

2. Priority need(s) that will be address in the goal and action plan include Innovation and Collective  

Responsibility with an increased number of teachers positively responding to questions on the School Quality Guide 
survey about staff’s collective responsibility for all students to learn and support each others’ professional practices 
through intervisitations, reflective feedback, and analysis of student work. Additionally, we will continue to reassess 
and modify our professional development system in order to increase teacher and staff collaboration while continuing 
to norm common, coherent assessments that support rigorous instruction.

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all content area professional learning communities will participate in customized intervistation and 
inquiry-based cycles of learning that increase data-driven peer collaboration and a collective responsibility for student 
achievement that will result in increased academic interventions for students, and increased structured feedback 
opportunities among teachers for self-identified supports to build capacity with the expectations of the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Continuing protocols around data analysis for teacher teams to 
utilize in conjunction with network support will assist teachers in 
making informed instructional decisions based on analyzing 
student work and modifying curriculum and assessments. 

Administration, lead teachers, and coaches will identify learning 
gaps based on state assessment, MasteryConnect, and content 
baselines. Based on these identified gaps, lead teachers and 
coaches will collaboratively make customizations to curricula that 
provide access for all learners to higher order critical thinking 
skills. 

Inquiry-based professional development with consultants such as 
Giselle O. Martin-Kniep and Ellie Drago-Severson will increase 
time and resources for teachers to talk with one another about 
instruction, as well as deepen their understandings of adult 
learning. 

Families will receive messages on Skedula and be able to 
message staff to increase opportunities for staff-family 
collaboration.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on our 2017-18 Quality Review and our designation as a model middle school, we successfully support a range 
of diverse learners. We consistently see a decrease in students on level 1 in ELA and math during their time at our 
school, and leadership works cohesively to ensure all staff is supported inside and outside of the classroom. 

 

1.  According to our 2017-18 School Quality Survey, our school showed a 5% increase in the percent of positive 

responses to questions regarding Instructional Leadership and Program Coherence, and a 4% increase to 
positive answers regarding Teacher Influence. Most of staff agree or strongly agree that the principal sets high 
standards for student learning, and sets clear expectations for teachers about implementing what they have 
learned in professional development. Additionally, on our 2017-18 Quality Review, our school received a 
rating of Well Developed across all Systems of Improvement, including 1.3 (Strategic organizational decisions 
to support the school’s instructional goals and meet student learning needs,) 3.1 (Establish a coherent vision 
of school improvement that is reflected in data-based goals,) and 4.1 (Observe teachers using the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching along with the analysis of learning outcomes to elevate school-wide instructional 
practices and implement strategies that promote professional growth and reflection). 

 

2. A priority need that will be addressed this year will be continued support for all staff to receive effective feedback 
through strategic use of feedback cycles that identify strengths and next steps. Additionally, continuing to give 
support to build capacity for top tier teachers and spread leadership throughout the building will be part of our action 
plan. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all staff will participate in inquiry-based PLCs that increase teacher understanding of how to integrate 
21st Century learning into customized classroom projects, as measured through staff surveys about the 21st century 
skills and data driven classroom planning, and student surveys measuring understanding of how content skills link to 
deeper critical thinking during project based learning.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
1.  Based on 2017-2018 family attendance at parent teacher conferences, we saw the highest number of families 

return to all three PTCs. Additionally, moving 6th grade orientation from June to April increased attendance 
and ensured many more incoming 6th graders have filled out a House Preference sheet and opted into a 
range of programs offered during and after school. Additionally, family communication through PupilPath has 
increased teacher correspondence with families and allowed for increased engagement in school activities. 

 

 

2.  We want parents to come up to the school more regularly during the Tuesday parent engagement time from 
2:40-3:20 p.m. We want to use parent attendance on Tuesday afternoon to inform them of upcoming events 
and volunteer opportunities as well as learning about their child’s progress and learning outside of the parent 
teacher conferences. As well, parents will use this time to email or call parents in cycles. 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will have 90% of parents respond on both internal school surveys and the NYC DOE Quality Guide 
Survey that they are receiving clear communication about what their child is learning, academic level, social and 
emotional development, classroom learning experience, and parent events and activities.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 
Middle School 88, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the 
school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, 
Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Middle School 88 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school

surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting

families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.(ESSA)/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations

To meet the achievement needs of our 6-8 grade ELLs and former ELLs who tested 
Commanding within the past two years who are at level 1 or 2 on their NYS ELA exam, we have 
in place: 
A morning program differentiated for newcomers and Long Term ELLs that is conducted three 
days per week from 7:30 to 8:20 a.m.  This program will run nine months. This morning program 
currently serves 60 of our ELLs and former ELLs.  ELLs and Long-Term ELL students are 
instructed in English communication skills using the latest version of MyOn language 
software. Newcomer students are instructed using the Wilson Reading System. These programs 
are, separately, designed improve fluency and to scaffold non-fiction reading passages for 
students in preparation for the ELA and NYSESLAT exams and in alignment with the Common 
Core Standards. Three certified ENL teachers use a team-teaching model and meet once a week 
after school to plan instruction. 
The after-school program open to all ELLs and will run for six months meeting two days a week 
from 2:40 to 4:00 pm.   Three licensed ENL teachers will work with groups of 30 students 
differentiated into entering, emerging and transitioning and expanding levels. Instruction is 
carried out in English, and three ENL teachers are bilingual in Spanish, which may be used to 
provide additional support for native language Spanish speakers, especially entering level. We 
have determined that students need practice with speaking and listening tasks and those students 
will spend part of the instructional time utilizing listening centers, and Flocabulary, as well as 
engaging in discussion activities to improve listening and speaking skills. The purpose of this 
after-school program will be to prepare students for success as measured by the Common Core 
Standards, as well as to bolster their readiness for the ELA, Math and the NYSESLAT exam. 
Teachers will keep a school year log in a binder of student attendance and parent 
communication. 
The data sources include analysis of the past two years' NYSESLAT results, the math and ELA 
item skills analysis and the ELL data tool kit (EDAT report)..

In investigating student achievement needs using the student work study protocol, ENL teachers 
noticed that the skills students are expected to demonstrate on the NYSESLAT differ from the 
manner in which the skills are demonstrated on the NYS ELA exam. The strategies for reading 
and writing expected on the NYS ELA do not transfer to the rubric expectations of the 
NYSESLAT. The teachers' achievement goals for the students go well beyond the NYSESLAT

Part C: Professional Development  
and the NYS ELA exam. We want to prepare students to be proficient in the English language 
and critical thinkers as well as honoring their native language. 
 
To improve teaching practices for the achievement of our ELLs, we developed an extensive 
Professional Development program in concert with Teachers College, Teaching Matters, and the 
Middle School Quality Imitative (MSQI). In addition to sending ENL teachers to TC calendar 
days that support the curriculum for ELLs, we utilize Teaching Matters' workshops, in particular 
a yearlong study of language acquisition with Maryann Reilly and interdisciplinary PLCs with a 
focus on ELLs students. We programmed dedicated cycles to have our staff developer and 
education consultant work with ENL teachers and content area teachers on strategies in reading 
and writing, content area skills, language acquisition, and data analysis and its implications on 
planning through the Middle School Quality Initiative. We also offer a series of after school 
professional development cycles centered on the following areas: word study, NYSESLAT prep, 
and backward design curriculum planning. 
Professional development is ongoing for ENL teachers to attend training offered through 
the NYCDOE OELL, TCRWP, and Brooklyn North Field Support workshops. 
Our work with Teachers College Reading Writing Project is strategic in two ways to support: (1) 
ENL teachers attend calendar days to specifically address the needs of our ELL and immigrant 
student subgroups and (2) our staff developer works one-on-one and in small groups with our 
ENL teachers in order to provide planning and instructional support in the classroom. As 
an MSQI school, we are focused on raising literacy levels and reading comprehension for all of 
our students, including ELLs and immigrant students, through academic vocabulary study. ENL 
teachers are being trained and supported by MSQI coach, Kate Mobarak. 
The ENL teachers regularly meet with other teachers to discuss ways of addressing the needs of 
incoming ELLs and immigrant students. 
The ENL teachers attend professional development sessions (calendar days) at Teachers College, 
at Teaching Matters, and at MSQI that are specifically tailored to ELLs. The school secretary 
maintains a log of assistance which serves as documentation for all Professional Development 
activities. All ENL and content area teachers use a combination of tablet apps and continue 
ongoing professional development in education technology tools. 
Most importantly, we have reconfigured our Professional Development matrix for ENL teachers 
to receive support in the area that they have requested based on the identified focus areas 
of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. Specifically, ENL teachers must inter-visit ENL 
classrooms as part of our Watching Others Work initiative. This allows teachers to observe one 
another with a lens toward improving one area of their practice. Teachers then meet with the 
supervisor to debrief and provide follow-through to ensure that these observed best practices are 
implemented in their classrooms. 
We have an MSQI coach, twice monthly on Thursdays, piloting Word Generation to develop 
academic vocabulary for ELLs and immigrant students.  Our Teaching Matters consultant comes 
in weekly on Fridays in cycles of work with literacy department and ENL teachers with a focus 
on the needs of ELLs and immigrant students.

supervisor to debrief and provide follow-through to ensure that these observed best practices are 
implemented in their classrooms. 
We have an MSQI coach, twice monthly on Thursdays, piloting Word Generation to develop 
academic vocabulary for ELLs and immigrant students.  Our Teaching Matters consultant comes 
in weekly on Mondays in cycles of work with literacy department teachers with a focus on the 
needs of ELLs and immigrant students. 
Attendance is taken at every PD whether it is in the building or out of the building. Teachers who 
have PD with external consultants in-house and attend off-site PD have agendas for the 
professional learning.

Begin description here:            
In order to engage parents of English language learners, we distribute a Parent Survey at the 
beginning of each year to better understand parent concerns and individual family needs, and 
parents also provide feedback to the school through the Annual School Environment Survey. 
 
Our Parent Coordinator, Tracy Jordan, who is fluent in Spanish, runs health workshops for 
parents in conjunction with Health Plus and Lutheran Hospital. She meets regularly with ELL 
regarding the emotional and academic well-being of all students providing them with and 
connecting them to school-based and community-based support resources.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
With the introduction of IDNYC, we launched our own initiative of parent outreach to apply for 
the IDNYC highlighting the free access to cultural instructions, the ease of accessing government 
and municipal buildings and offices, and most importantly how easy it is to accrue the points 
necessary to apply for IDNYC through regular parent workshops on IDNYC and parent-school 
created IDNYC posters and brochures. We post available appointments that parents can sign up 
for to apply for IDNYC and answer questions of who examples where a parent’s family member 
was deemed ineligible. Our answers comply with the requirements listed on NYC.gov. 
Technology workshops for parents of ELLs including use of M.S. 88's web-based programs such 
as Khan Academy, Learn Zillion, NewsELA, ThinkCERCA and Engrade are offered several 
times a year. 
 
International Food Festival Pot Luck Day, held November 25, as well as Crossing Languages 
and Cultures through Art, held December 22, featuring music and drama performances and 
painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography displays engage parents in a context that goes 
beyond spoken and written language. 
We have 4-6 curriculum nights at the school where teachers have parents experience reading, 
writing, or math learning activities using texts in English, Spanish, Chinese and Bengali where 
available so that parents can understand what their children are doing in school and connect as 
lifelong learners themselves, with the take-away of strategies to support their children at home in 
their home language. 
 
Information about the workshops, arts and culture nights and curriculum nights are 
communicated to parents via fliers posted in the main entrance lobby and the PTA room, via 
email, via phone master, via text message, via fliers and notices sent home in student backpacks, 
and monthly parent calendar and newsletter posted on the school website, emailed and 
backpacked home. Evening meetings and workshops are scheduled from 6-8 p.m. and afternoon 
meetings and workshops are scheduled from 2:50-4 p.m. on Tuesdays once a month.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Teachers College assessment pro levels as our school's ELL Periodic Assessment tool. Assessments are given 
quarterly and coaching and planning time is used to assess and respond to data trends and item analysis and plan instruction 
accordingly.  These data allow us to group students into groups based on their book bands (TC reading level) and push 
students towards improved reading volume and comprehension, as part of their long term student goals.   Additionally, we 
have used the DRP with our 6th grade and identified students from our beginner ELL classes who will be working with teachers 
trained in Wilson's Just Words program which addresses reading comprehension deficits.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We examine a variety of data sources through ATS reports, item analyses spreadsheets and the school's Quality Guide 
subgroup breakdown in order to determine the success of our programs for ELLs.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
In looking at NYSESLAT data, we have observed a two distinct trends in regard to the relative strength and weaknesses of 
students in each modality of the exam.  Analyzing which modality students scored lowest on, we found that our 6th and 7th 
graders struggled most with the writing modality, 8th graders scored lowest on the listening modality of the test.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Middle School 88 currently has a total enrollment of 1437 students and ____ English Language Learners (or ____ % of 
the total population), all of whom are served by a freestanding ENL program. Our program serves ___ General 
Education and ___ Special Education students in the  6th, 7th and 8th grades. All of our entitled students receive 
more than their mandated minutes of ENL instruction from a combination of a block ENL program for general 
education students in the 6th and 7th grades, a push in program for general education students in the 8th grade, and 
a pull-out program for  special education students in all three grades. During the pull out programs,  a mix of high-low 
texts and instructional programs to assist in meeting the recommended principles of a freestanding ELL program 
which include but are not limited to : utilizing Native Language support to make content comprehensible; 
incorporating ENL strategies and assisting students to achieve the State-designated level of English proficiency for 
their grade.   The general education population is divided among six classes.  Four classes in the 6th grade and one 
class in the 7th grade are entirely comprised of ELLs. The 8th grade ELL class comprises mostly ELLs with a small 
number of former ELLs, who were determined to need additional ENL support.  The program is taught exclusively in 
English but all five of our ENL teachers are fluent in Spanish. Since Spanish is the largest home language group among 
our ENL population and more than half of the beginner students are speakers of Spanish, this allows the ENL teachers 
to better support L1 in the classroom. Special Education students are served through a combination push-in/pull-out 
program.  All students receive their mandated minutes of service according to their NYSESLAT levels.  Instruction of 
ENL is differentiated  based on data from the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, ELA Exam, Reading Levels and IEP where 
appropriate.  Item analysis trends are examined across the grade levels in order to determine specific teaching points 
and  NYS and Common Core State Standards that must be addressed.   Additionally, student reading levels are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

analyzed for patterns in order to make sure that classroom libraries can address specific needs in ENL 
classrooms   This differentiation is further tailored to student need based on an ongoing dialogue between ENL and 
content area teachers. To better understand student needs, students ability levels are evaluated in their own 
languages. This is done formally for Spanish speakers using the Spanish LAB-R and informally for speakers of other 
languages through informal interviews between students and teachers who are speakers of the same languages, 
including Mr. Ibrahim for Arabic and Ms. Tran for Mandarin, as well as DOE translation phone translation services as 
needed.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Since our ELLs are programmed into designated classes for ENL, they receive all of their mandated  periods of ENL services 
during the normal literacy block from a certified ENL teacher. Advanced students receive their mandated periods of ELA 
instruction during  periods in which a licensed literacy teacher pushes into the ENL classroom. Thus, ELLs  receive the same 
quantity of mathematics and content area instruction as do all of our non ELL students.  All teacher licenses are kept on file. 
All of our English Language Learners receive more than the mandated 180 or 360 instructional minutes per week, and teacher 
schedules allow for additional push-in periods to be arranged in content area classes as necessary.     
  
It is important to differentiate instruction among subgroups of ELLs in order to maintain academic rigor. In order to 
differentiate, it’s important to have a thorough understanding of the data at hand. The ENL teachers regularly reference 
student transcripts and records which are easily accessible as ATS reports, and IEPs as needed. All of this data, combined with 
our informal assessments help to inform teachers of the specific skills in which ELLs need support.  Additionally, we have a 
range of ELL students who are a part of our Integrated Curriculum pilot program in which all teachers work together to create 
a differentiated learning plan that addresses student needs in terms of entry points of instruction, materials used, and 
product.   
  
Our ELLs with IEPs are a special group because many of them were born in this country and speak English with native-like 
fluency.  In order to provide a range of support for our ELLs with IEPs, the differentiation process starts with the class 
formation.  In our ICT classes, we group our ELLs with IEPs in the same class in order to provide opportunities for both ENL and 
content area teachers to work with students on common strategies and skills.  These students need vocabulary building as well 
as particular help with reading and writing skills. The ENL teacher communicates regularly with IEP teachers to understand the 
needs of each ENL student with an IEP. As is common practice with all of our SWD, IEP teachers share best practices with the 
ENL teacher. 
  
All English Language Learners receive mandated testing accommodations for ELLs, including a separate location, time 
extension (time and a half unless an additional time extension is required by a student's IEP), a third reading of the listening 
section on the ELA exam, bilingual dictionaries and bilingual content area glossaries for all home languages on content area 
exams.  For those content exams available in translated versions from the State of New York, ELL students may elect to do 
their exam either in English or in their home language, or to use a copy in their home language as a reference.  Students are 
asked to consider this decision in advanced and are instructed to make sure they only record answers in one booklet, as well 
as given strategies to budget their time accordingly if using these additional materials. When the Department of Education 
does not provide a translated version for a student's home language, the student and parent is allowed to request a translator 
for the exam to provide a direct oral translation of the English version into the student's home language. Former ELLs receive 
the same accommodations as ELLs for two additional years after testing out on the NYSESLAT. Since the NYSESLAT is a test 
specifically designed for ELLs, no such accommodations are necessary for its administration.    
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content area teachers are given support and materials to scaffold content for ELLs and to identify instructional materials, 
including technology, that support ELLs and all our learners in terms of achieving success in meeting the CCLS. Examples of 
these supports include leveled content texts, word walls, native language texts and alternative assessments. ESL teachers also 
provide information about cultural differences and learning styles of ELLs. As all of our ELLs are performing at or above grade 
level, targeted intervention is not as much a focus as general strategies that serve to allow entry points for various types of 
learners. Our supports, consistent with the performance level of our ELLs, are aligned to grade-level standards and support the 
grade-level instructional goals of the ELLs. Teachers have common planning time to discuss students, student data and 
strategies for success. After school and supplemental services include small group tutorials which are programmed and 
matched to facilitate specific content needs. All students take electives in content-rich and experiential art classes. 
Effectiveness of instruction is assessed by classroom instruments, teacher and student self-assessments as well as 
standardized tests such as the State ELA and subject area exams, the subject area Regents and the NYSESLAT, all of which are 
addressed explicitly through test item prep lessons and a general “test sophisticated” classroom culture. Teachers use 
MasteryConnect to access program-wide data on student performance.  Additionally this year in accordance with our school's 
data and in conjunction with MSQI, we have piloted the WordGen vocabulary acquisition program in our ENL classes this year . 
ELL students have access to all school programs. Newly enrolled ELL students, no matter what grade level are invited to our 
orientations over the summer and at the beginning of the school year. All ELL students have homework help with their ELA or 
content area teacher, as well as with outside tutors, who can provide native language support. We offer language classes in 
Spanish and Latin. The ELA teacher meets with the students' other content area teachers to discuss targeted ENL strategies for 
the newly enrolled student. Additionally, we try to “buddy” the newly enrolled student with an older student who can serve as 
a peer mentor. The students are also encouraged to join after- school clubs and sports.  ELL students who reach proficiency on 
the NYSESLAT continue to receive small-group support and tutorial support. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our ELL populations represent diverse geographic and linguistic backgrounds, with many students born in Mexico, Ecuador, 
Dominican Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Bangladesh, China, and Yemen, among other countries. The native languages spoken by 
our ELLs include Spanish , Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Polish, and Russian. All languages are addressed in terms of being supplied 
with bilingual dictionaries/glossaries.  When available assessments are ordered in the students' native languages  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE

It is important to differentiate instruction among subgroups of ELLs in order to maintain academic rigor. In order to 
differentiate, it’s important to have a thorough understanding of the data at hand. The ENL teachers regularly reference 
student transcripts and records which are easily accessible via data on ATS reports, and IEPs as needed. All of this data, 
combined with our informal assessments help to inform teachers of the specific skills in which ELLs need support.  Additionally, 
we have a range of ELL students who are a part of our Integrated Curriculum pilot program in which all teachers work together 
to create a differentiated learning plan that addresses student needs in terms of entry points of instruction, materials used, 
and product.  Specifically:  
  
a. SIFE students receive one-on-one tutoring and academic mentoring with their ENL teacher. 
They receive intervention during the school day as well as in after-school programs. They are also supported through both the 
push-in and pull-out models in their content area classes. These students are placed in homogeneous groups to grasp basic 
concepts, and in heterogeneous groups to learn from their peers. Teachers across all content areas scaffold lessons by using 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

instructional strategies: activating schema, using visual aids, and diagramming. SIFE students also develop higher order 
thinking skills through sorting, analyzing, and synthesizing reading passages that appropriate to their comprehension 
level.  The students’ progress will be assessed each marking period in order to evaluate and revise interventions as 
appropriate. 
  
b. Our Newcomer ELLs also receive daily instruction in small groups, as well as one-on-one tutoring with their ENL 
teacher.  Since English language proficiency is required for a student to master extensive reading and comprehension skills, all 
newcomers have a rigorous curriculum that focuses on vocabulary building, broadening their use of written English by way of 
explicit grammar instruction, reading strategies, and building listening and speaking skills.  Our newcomers are also supported 
through the push-in model in their content area classes. 
c. ELLs receiving 4-6 years of service still need to increase their vocabulary, but they have a variety of needs that can be 
addressed through differentiation. These students have shown potential to progress and are generally very motivated 
academically. They benefit from the integrated planning model used as part of our school’s Circular 6 plan.  This allows 
teachers to have an overall picture of these students across all content areas and allows for pairing of our ELLs with high 
achieving English speaking students.  
  
d. Long-term ELLs need more intensive and personalized attention from teachers to address their particular learning styles. 
The ENL teachers gather information from various sources (see above) to learn what environment each student performs best 
in and works to create that both in the ENL class as well as in the content area. These students need consistent, frequent 
opportunities to learn and reinforce skills and content that they need to master in their core classes. Vocabulary building as 
well as skills such as note-taking and synthesizing ideas gleaned from the text is the focus of these long-term ELLs.   
  
e. Our former ELL data is analyzed according to their Common Core statewide assessments.  Students are then retained in ELL 
classes if it is determined that they need continued support and scaffolding.  We continue to track the data of all of our 
students who are F-ELLs no matter which type of class that the students are placed in.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Content area teachers are given support and materials to scaffold content for ELLs and to identify instructional materials, 
including technology, that support ELLs and all our learners. Examples of these supports include leveled content texts, word 
walls, native language texts and alternative assessments. ENL teachers also provide information about cultural differences and 
learning styles of ELLs. As all of our ELLs are performing at or above grade level, targeted intervention is not as much a focus as 
general strategies that serve to allow entry points for various types of learners. Our supports, consistent with the performance 
level of our ELLs, are aligned to grade-level standards and support the grade-level instructional goals of the ELLs. Teachers have 
common planning time to discuss students, student data and strategies for success. After school and supplemental services 
include small group tutorials which are programmed and matched to facilitate specific content needs. All students take 
electives in content-rich and experiential art classes. Effectiveness of instruction is assessed by classroom instruments, teacher 
and student self-assessments as well as standardized tests such as the State ELA and subject area exams, the subject area 
Regents and the NYSESLAT, all of which are addressed explicitly through test item prep lessons and a general “test 
sophisticated” classroom culture. Teachers use MasteryConnect to access program-wide data on student performance.  ELL 
students have access to all school programs. Newly enrolled ELL students, no matter what grade level are invited to our 
orientations over the summer and at the beginning of the school year. All ELL students have homework help with their ELA or 
content area teacher, as well as with outside tutors, who can provide native language support. We offer language classes in 
Spanish. The ELA teacher meets with the students' other content area teachers to discuss targeted ENL strategies for the newly 
enrolled student. Additionally, we try to “buddy” the newly enrolled student with an older student who can serve as a peer 
mentor. The students are also encouraged to join after- school clubs and sports.  ELL students who reach proficiency on the 
NYSESLAT continue to receive small-group support and tutorial support.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

Our ELLs with IEPs are a special group because many of them were born in this country and speak English with native-like 
fluency.  In order to provide a range of support for our ELLs with IEPs, the differentiation process starts with the class 
formation.  In our ICT classes, we group our ELLs with IEPs in the same class in order to provide opportunities for both ESL and 
content area teachers to work with students on common strategies and skills.  These students need vocabulary building as well 
as particular help with reading and writing skills. The ESL teacher communicates regularly with IEP teachers to understand the 
needs of each ESL student with an IEP. As is common practice with all of our SWD, IEP teachers share best practices with the 
ESL teacher. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Academic achievement of our ELL population is further targeted by our extended day AIS programs as well as our after-school 
programs.  Additionally, in order to specifically address the needs of our ELL students in ELA), we have trained all of our ELL 
teachers in Wilson's Just Words.  This program provides differentiated reading and writing instruction that reaches every 
student at his or her individual reading level.  Each student's level of comprehension for informational text is 
determined.  Then, by providing level-appropriate, standards-aligned non fiction assignments the program provides teachers 
with real-time diagnostic data via ongoing assessments.  We have also provided parallel classroom library texts on all levels in 
the ELL classrooms in both English and the students' native languages.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have launched Wilson's Just Words as a full ongoing program with our 6th grade ELL students.  Additionally, we have 
launched the aforementioned vocabulary program, WordGen which is being implemented in all core content areas.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We discontinued Achieve 3000 and have instead had our social studies teachers of ENL students use the current events 
program, Newsela which allows students to experience the same content at different Lexile levels and ThinkCERCA which has a 
proven track record at our school for lifting student progress. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We are proud this year to offer a fully comprehensive, free after school program provided by LEAP which folds in academic, 
artistic and athletic elements.  Additionally all ELLs are offered equal opportunity to participate in all of our school’s extra 
curricular activities, which include Design Thinking, LEGO Robotics, Band, Yearbook, and Theater as well as a multitude of arts 
and athletic programs.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school makes a large investment in technology for ELLs, including extensive leveled classroom libraries including two  
significant Native Language libraries in Spanish, listening centers and iPads for ENL classrooms, up to date  
Rosetta Stone software, and classroom document cameras. ENL teachers and ELL students have priority over  
the school’s computer lab, and each ENL class enjoys dedicated time in the lab as part of its weekly schedule.  
Because of our strengths as an ENL department and the priority we place on ELLs as a school community, we  
believe we could serve as a model for other programs for years to come    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 
Instructional materials are available in students' native languages across the ENL/ELA classrooms.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Professional development is ongoing for all ELL personnel, including APs, subject area teachers, secretaries,  
and the parent coordinator. The ENL teacher and content area teachers attend training offered through the  
NYCDOE, BETAC, and QTEL Institutes.  As part of our Professional Development plan developed this year, all teachers are 
offered the opportunity for inter-visitations in the classrooms of their colleagues. Additionally, we continue to work with  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

Teachers College in two ways to support all personnel who come into contact with our ELLs: (1) ENL and  
Content Area teachers and ELL support staff attend calendar days to specifically address the needs of our ELL  
subgroup and (2) our staff developer works one-on-one and in small groups with our ENL and content area  
teachers in order to provide planning and instructional support in the classroom.  We differentiate our curriculum across the 
content areas in order to ensure that all students including ELLs are being serviced at the appropriate age and grade level.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school makes a large investment in technology for ELLs, including extensive leveled classroom libraries including 
two significant Native Language libraries in Spanish, listening centers and ipods for ENL classrooms, up to date Rosetta Stone 
software, and classroom document cameras. ENL teachers and ELL students have priority over the school’s computer lab, and 
each ENL class enjoys dedicated time in the lab as part of its weekly schedule.  
Because of our strengths as an ENL department and the priority we place on ELLs as a school community, we  
believe we could serve as a model for other programs for years to come. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We include our ELL students in our 6th grade orientation in order to make sure that they are prepared for the bginning of the 
new school year.  Students and their parents are invited to this event in which tey meet the support staff that will be servicing 
the children throughout the year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is offered as the school's only elective language.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Five 50-minute professional development sessions will be devoted to ELL services. ENL teachers will meet with content-area 
teachers during daily team planning time to assist them in planning, delivery of instruction and assessment. All teachers and 
administrators serving ELLs will participate in regional professional development offerings, such as how to administer the 
NYSELAT and techniques on differentiating instruction and aligning ELL instruction with Common Core Standards.  There is also 
a separate meeting for all staff members who will be administering statewide exams that focuses on making sure that testing 
accommodations for ELL students.   All content teachers are trained to develop a college and career ready culture for ELLs that 
begins in 6th grade, as students transition from elementary school. Implementation and effectiveness of professional 
development will be assessed by classroom observation by administration and coaches, as well as self-reflection. The ENL 
teachers will turn-key the training listed above to English and content area teachers, as well as secretaries and the parent 
coordinator in five 1-hour workshops. These workshops will be held the Monday during Professional Development 
sessions.   Additionally, our teachers in the ELL department meet weekly for a 35-minute Professional Development session 
tied into the current best practices in supporting ELLs to be successful in utilizing the CCLS. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

Our ENL teachers plan weekly with content area teachers, and monthly with assistant principals and as needed with the 
principal to build their capacity in ensuring the rigor of content delivery while building entry points for students such as 
sentence-starters, organizational tools, language analysis and reading strategies. These weekly sessions last 45 minutes, 
resulting in 225 monthly minutes of teacher and staff training. 
Our support staff, such as the guidance counselor, office staff and parent coordinator, participate in twice-yearly, half-day 
workshops offered by the network and/or centrally. The guidance counselor is also trained in transition needs and routines as 
our students transition from middle school to high school.     
We believe in a holistic approach to language development in literacy and all content areas. The professional development on 
Mondays incorporates sound ELL instructional strategies because our population of ELLs and F-ELLs make up nearly two-thirds 
of the school. This includes teacher-led workshops on building vocabulary across content, vocabulary front-loading, using 
technology to support language acquisition and  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Aside from English language fluency, ELLs have the same developmental characteristics and needs of any incoming 6  
th   grader and graduating 8  th   grader. Our teachers of 6  th   grade are aware of and trained in the needs of children 
transitioning from a one to two teacher all-day block schedule to a changing program with five to six teachers and traveling 
from classroom to classroom. The uniqueness is to support the language development and to communicate the differences to 
the families of ELLs.  
Please refer to response B. 1. The school secretary maintains attendance records for on-site and off-site PD. Teachers record 
and save meeting minutes that are shared with administration on Google Drive or Dropbox.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
During parent engagement time on Tuesdays we run workshops for all parents and include Spanish translation as needed. 
During feeder school tours we provide Spanish translation for parents.    

 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ailene Altman Mitchell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We have records of parents' language surveys for our current year 7 th and 8 th grade students. All 
parents/guardians of newly enrolled students fill out a Home Language Survey when enrolling their child. This 
form is maintained as part of the student’s record. If the parent/guardian indicates on the HLIS that they would 
like to receive information from the school in their home language, forms being sent home are translated either in 
written form or orally to the parent/guardian. Information from teachers is translated to parents by staff 
members who speak the home language or via telephone translation unit. There are currently 174 ELLs at Middle 
School 88. During the first week of school and curriculum night, the parents provide requests for language 
preference and they document their language preference on the emergency contact cards. The ATS Report of 
Preferred Languages is updated regularly in order to maintain accurate information on parent language choices

children's new grade and provides curriculum information. The next 
three, held in November, March and June are focused on student 
progress and grades. The ENL teacher holds a parent orientation for 
any newly enrolled ELL parent/guardian as well as separate meetings 
for individual ELL parent/guardians throughout the year. Teachers 
communicate with parents throughout the year via PupilPath, 
Remind or Youcanbook.me in order to address questions/concerns 
ad well as any possible issues in or outside of the classroom. If 
necessary, the guidance counselor will also be present during such 
meetings. In addition to these meetings, a designated one to one 
parent conference will take place annually in order to provide 
updates on student progress as mandated by CR Part 154.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys are distributed at the beginning of the year which gather feedback from parents on the quality and 
availability of services. The ENL teacher also meets individually with all parents/guardians of ELLs and can then also 
ascertain the needs and concerns that they may have. After such meetings,the ENL teacher confers with the parent 
coordinator and/or the classroom teachers in order to discuss the needs of the parents/guardians and students. In 
order to gather feedback from parents, we are creating a focus group of multilingual and multicultural parents to 
discuss their needs and the needs of their children. We can obtain information to inform our practices in order to 
improve the quality and availability of services we provide to parents and students.
