Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
School Receivership   
In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which 
established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new 
law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools 
that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two-
year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City 
Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed 
under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          5 

 
core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant 
interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close 
achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 
the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students.

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          6 

 
The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          7 

 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
  
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: Renewal School Narrative 

 

In a brief narrative, describe the current state of the Renewal school addressing the following:  

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

partners in furthering student achievement  

5.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the 

Framework for Great Schools and indicate where this has been a challenge. 

6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 

Effective November 29, 2017, Martin Van Buren High School accountability status was upgraded to a school in Good 
Standing as per NYSED. In addition, since we have met our New York State Benchmarks for both the 2015-16 and 
2016-17 school years, Martin Van Buren is no longer a Priority School and was removed from the State's Receivership 
list. Graduation rates have increased from 45% in 2012 to 76.44% in June 2018, and 79% in August 2018, the 
attendance rate is 88 %, and the College and Career Readiness is now 54% for the 2018 year (from a low of 12%), 
above the city average! Additionally, the 6-year graduation rate was 78.1% which indicates a significant upward trend.  

Our community continues to make extensive community and civic outreach through community partnerships with the 
Central Queens Y and the Rocky Hill Civic group and collaboration with Community Superintendent Danielle Giunta of 
District 26.  

Through these efforts, we continue to achieve our mission of being an evolving community of lifelong learners who 
see learning and hard work as a continual process striving to develop students, staff, and parents’ innate sense of 
curiosity. We are dedicated to the academic success and social development of all students. We believe that if 
students are given time, appropriate writing strategies such as the Hochman Writing Revolution Method, engaging in 
constructive dialogue with peers, and are given continuous actionable feedback, writing outcomes will improve.  

For the past three years, Martin Van Buren answered community requests for special programs and career pathways. 
The Humanities and Law programs engages students in the Arts, encourages students to positively impact our 
changing society through social justice awareness. The Health Careers and Engineering programs will engage our 
students in multiple pathways to explore and implement the sciences through collaboration with our Science 
Research Program. We will continue to establish our grade teams where we are building the foundation for problem 
solving skills, collaboration, literacy, and writing evidence-based claims.  

In an effort to promote the successes of our school and our grade teams, we are committed to the following:  

  Electing a school committee focused on promoting our school.  
  Celebrating student achievement through recognition nights  


In order to best support our students with disabilities, we have a Hearing Education Services (HES) D75 program in our 
school which includes sign language translators that assist students in their classrooms. We are planning to use 
Rewards and other reading and writing supports as an intervention service to increase literacy that will translate into 
improved reading and writing skills.  

We are increasing communications with families and the community through the generous support of our MVB 
Alumni Alliance. We have many notable graduates, including two Nobel Laureates, who are dedicated to supporting 
and building career pathways.  

We have built relationships with families through our Saturday and Monday PTA meetings, Student Recognition 
Nights, Festivals, and Family Nights. Our CBO, Central Queens YM & YWHA (CQY), is promoting efforts to build 
community and family relationships through events like Family Community Night, Saturday Community Forums 
stemming from our Community Engagement Team (CET), and personalized outreach. Through the Central Queens YM 
& YWHA, we have the A.C.E. program which provides support and interventions for 9th and 10th graders and the 
S.O.A.R. program who provide counseling, college preparation, small group support and academic supports for our 
11th and 12th graders. In addition, we have a Mindfulness and Meditation Program through Flower Yoga which 
strives to help students manage the stresses of teenage life, academic and social pressures and how to create 
acceptance of themselves. We have built a strong partnership with Queensborough Community College through their 
Career Cluster courses and College Now.. Through John Jay College, York College, and Long Island Jewish Hospital, we 
have internships and classes for students.   

With the support of our School Leadership Team, we have been able to provide multiple internship opportunities to 
our student body including the following:

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Strengths  

Feedback from the May 2018 Quality Review indicated that our teacher teams were adept at analyzing the elements of 
teacher practice based on looking at student work and utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data. Teachers are an 
active part in the leadership of the school and have leadership roles throughout the school. There is a shared 
improvement in teacher practice and mastery of goals for specific groups of students. Teacher voice play an integral part 
of key decision making that improves student learning. Through the school’s SLCs, where teachers’ systematic review of 
practices occurs, there is implementation of annotation strategies and students’ self-assessment rubrics. Model 
teachers are also integral to the improvement of our school and serve as Lead Teachers.  

We also utilize Skedula which enables both parents and student to monitor student progress and growth.  

We have used the DataWise system across all department teams, which emphasizes determining specific Student 
Learner Centered Problems as well as Teacher Problems of Practice. This is done over the school year systematically 
with the goal of using teacher based inter-visitations as a way to give collegial feedback on how to improve practice. 
Part of the process involves using rolling agendas, which keep all agendas and next steps in chronological context. 
Teachers and administrators are able to contribute to the agendas and guide student improvement.  

The implementation of Datawise has laid the foundation for the adaptation of curricula based on student data. By 
triangulating data, we are able to make modifications to EngageNY in ELA and Math, New Visions Curriculum, NY Scope 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          17 

 

and Sequence for Social Studies, and the NYS Blueprint for the Arts that results in differentiated lessons where teachers 
can share resources via a Google document and build off each other’s lessons.  

 

Focus  

According to our most recent Quality Review, our area of focus is in the area of pedagogy. Teacher practices have yet to 
become aligned to the curricula and the school’s belief that students learn best when involved in discussion as reflected 
in student work products. Student work products reflected uneven levels of thinking and participation. There is a need 
to ensure that challenging tasks are evidenced in all classrooms with high levels of student discussions. There is a lack of 
consistency of student engagement in some classrooms which can result in diminished student growth.  

 
Priority  

Teachers are strategically implementing small group instruction based on formative and summative assessment. 
Teachers provide standards-based problems to our students and then provide actionable feedback within groups or 
individual students. In addition, all classrooms have student self-evaluation rubrics that allow for reflective learning. 
Teachers use a variety of small group activities such as reciprocal teaching, gallery walks, and Socratic Seminars to 
promote student-student discourse.  

This year’s priority is aligning assessments to standards throughout all departments and content areas using District 
Public and other tools to ensure implementation of student based data into planning. Department teams are charged 
with creating summative assessments that will used to determine student strengths and area of need so that teachers 
can strategically target lesson. Teachers will be looking at the data and reviewing it with their students to build students' 
awareness of their needs for growth. We have multiple methods to gather assessment data through DDC/Datacation, 
REDS Reports, common writing rubrics and common assessments. However, these are not being used schoolwide and 
with enough consistency and regularity. We will continue to build upon teachers giving specific targeted feedback and 
checking for understanding in a lesson. There needs to be a stronger move towards creating systems where the 
assessments are utilized in the classroom to differentiate instruction and to adjust accordingly.  

 
Martin Van Buren’s Professional Learning calendar and Common Planning Time will reflect the focus on teachers 
planning for collaboration and using formative and summative assessments to align feedback and build student efficacy.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
Instructional Focus: If teachers consistently use data to provide meaningful, differentiated rigorous tasks in small group 
instruction that includes balanced assessment, then students will develop a shared ownership of their learning.  

Departmental Teams meet twice a week to use review student work and create standard-based assessments, and grade 
level teams meet once a week to share best strategies around small group instruction. Our Model Teachers run 
professional development around Regents-aligned tasks that promote rigor in their classes through small group 
instruction. Through our MVB Student Self Evaluation Rubric, our students are reflective learners who learn to be lead 
facilitators in their groups.  

Instructional Leaders will participate in regular evaluative and non-evaluative observational feedback cycles to provide 
next steps and guidance to meeting the instructional focus.  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          18 

 

Additional professional learning opportunities will be offered to teachers to support the instructional focus in: student 
engagement, checks for understanding (formative and summative assessment), data driven instruction, responding to 
students’ needs, and building capacity for students to monitor their own progress.  

In the weekly common planning meetings, teachers will align assessments and re-teaching practices with a focus on 
summative assessments and skill building and incorporate WIT and MEAL writing strategies.  

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
As of September 2018, Martin Van Buren has 13.46% of the student population that are ELL students and 11.52% that 
are students with disabilities. As a result, we understand the importance of meeting the needs of all of our students.  

Our Model and Peer Collaborative Teachers will work together with the administration to implement our instructional 
focus through professional learning throughout the year, supporting our staff and students. Our Model Teachers' 
classrooms will be used as labs to see the strategies expected of all staff, with time allotted for debrief and coaching 
sessions throughout the year.  

All students will receive challenging work that involves scaffolded and tiered texts and DOK questioning that is 
differentiated for the diverse learners. There will be multiple methods to check for understanding that indicates 
awareness of the students’ needs. Students will develop problem solving skills. 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
We will continue to offer Career Pathways to all students in the building which offers courses in Health Sciences, 
Engineering, Robotics, Computer Sciences, and Law. Students have self-selected their career choice pathways and will 
be taking electives aligned to their goals. Our expanded AP course offerings for the 2018-19 school year will be open to 
every student. MVBHS will be using cohort teams to ensure students are participants of College for All initiative. Cohort 
teams will be aligned to the Instructional Focus which emphasizes reading rigorous texts, increasing student to student 
discourse, and ensuring ongoing assessment and meaningful feedback. In the Cohort Team Common Planning Time 
(CPT) the teachers will design activities necessary for students’ to be College and Career Ready.  

Teachers will communicate and students will take ownership of the required College and Career Readiness levels 
needed to earn on their Regents. Test taking resources will be shared with students for test preparation. Families and 
students will receive multiple communications during the year from the administration, faculty and guidance regarding 
skills, habits, and behaviors to be College and Career Ready. The Math Department will offer tutoring for all freshmen 2 
days per week, block (double periods) Algebra and Geometry classes for all freshmen. In addition, the Math Department 
is offering tutoring for all grade levels 2 - 3 times per week, as well as preparation for sophomore Algebra. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
We will rely on our instructional focus as a guiding tool to setting up students for success.  

Instructional Focus : If teachers consistently use data to provide meaningful, differentiated rigorous tasks in small group 
instruction that includes balanced assessment, then students will develop a shared ownership of their learning. High 
expectations for all students that is grounded in the development of 21st century skills shown in writing across all 
disciplines, problem solving activities, and student-centered lessons for our diverse learners.  

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          19 

 

Utilizing both formative and summative assessments will enable teachers to differentiate and determine best entry 
points for students. Teachers will also establish small groups learning to ensure that student needs are met.  

Along with internal and standardized lexile level results that determine differentiated texts and problems, teachers will 
use differentiated time allotments and multi-leveled questioning along with auditory, kinesthetic, and visual entry 
points that will be used in daily lesson plans. 

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
We will use our diagnostic assessments to offer students’ Academic Intervention Services (AIS) and enrichment 
programs. Using WITsi strategies and inquiry, cohort groups will work with target populations to improve student 
writing. Teachers will use daily formative assessments to revise and scaffold lessons. Departments, Grade Teams, and 
teachers will use summative/benchmark assessments to revise Scope and Sequence content &/or skill lessons.

5.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

In our most recent Quality Review, we received a well-developed for high expectations and were commended for 
building a supportive environment through guidance, teacher teams, and other school-based supports. It was noted that 
we have clear communication about our instructional expectations as well as partnering with parents by effectively 
communicating a path to College and Careers or students. We have clear accountability for all expectations and support 
for student progress towards meeting all expectations.  

Strengths:  

  1:1 attention from staff to student, ACE, SOAR, , Adopt-a-Senior, LMHS  
  PBIS, Rewards Initiatives and bee bucks to reward positive behaviors  
 

Family and Community Events: Student Recognition Night, College Readiness, Financial Aid, ENL family outreach, 
and All Star Breakfasts  

  Attendance Team/CBO Outreach  

As a result of the above supports, attendance for the 2017-2018 school year increased from 86.8% to 87.5%.

Some of the populations that we targeted include: lowest-third; Black and Hispanic males; self-contained ISS students, 
students with multiple unsuccessful Regents results, struggling seniors, ENL students, students in temporary housing, 
chronic lateness students, and students in need of social-emotional support  

Priority  

Our priority is to increase student attendance in order to increase both credit accumulation and higher course grades 
and mastery in courses and Regents.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
All MVB stakeholders should be part of a school culture where students feel, excited, welcomed, supported, safe, 
challenged, and that their education has purpose.  

Through collaboration of our Community Based Organizations, Grade Level teams, our ENL Coordinator, and guidance 
counselors that are headed by our AP Pupil Personnel Services and CBO Director, we will create events and outreach 
systems for our families and our sub-grouped students who need various forms of support, including ACE, My Brother’s 
Keeper, and SOAR. Our Parent Coordinator will hold outreach and enrichment meetings with families.  

Within our Cohort teams and in collaboration with Central Queens Y we will have teachers engage in Success Mentoring 
with specific students reviewing early warning data (attendance, credit accumulation, progress reports, suspensions, 
and cohort tracker data) and to discuss student behavioral and attendance trends. We will use this data to develop 
strategies to support students in achieving their academic and social goals. We will improve attendance and reduce 
chronic absenteeism by increasing our efforts in outreach, including but not limited to targeted guidance intervention, 
Skedula messaging, home visits, and an adopt-a-student initiative. 

 

 

Who are your CBO partners? How will each CBO sustain and support the social-emotional and academic growth of 
your students?

How will you in partnership with your CBO will create a supportive environment and engagement for your students’ 
families? 
Central Queens YM & YWHA will be responsible for the project management of multiple initiatives created specifically 
for building stronger family and community ties. We will be increasing parental engagement for the CET and PTA in 
order to amplify parent involvement. We will be coordinating efforts with community partners such as ActionNYC (free 
and legal immigration services) and the Smiles for Success program through the Office of Health to serve targeted 
populations of families and students once a quarter. We will be hosting an Open House in late September for students, 
families and community partners followed by our second Community School Forum in late April. Throughout the year, 
we will also invite local businesses, local places of worship, mental health experts and family outreach groups to present 
their work to our families.  

 We will continue to conduct monthly universal and targeted attendance interventions in working partnership with 
students and staff. For our lowest third performing Black and Hispanic males, we will be enlisting the services of Center

          29 

 

 

 

 

for Supportive Schools to implement their Achievement Mentoring Program. In addition to the mentoring programming, 
we will also conduct leadership development groups for targeted students in order to support their social-emotional 
development. We will continue to conduct monthly campaigns for Positive Behavior Intervention Services (PBIS) word 
of the month coupled with postings of positive affirmations throughout the school grounds. We will also be conducting 
social-emotional professional development for faculty throughout the year.  

 

 
Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019, cutting during periods 1 and 9 and chronic lateness will be reduced by 5%, creating a safer school 
environment and regular attendance in classes due to increased monitoring, parent outreach, and personalization as 
measured by attendance data, I-Logs, Skedula and action plans anecdotes.

Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Strengths  

Our most recent Quality Review indicated that our Departmental teams and Grade Level teams allowed for teachers to 
analyze teacher practice from student work products. Teacher team meetings were an area of celebration as the 
teachers had created well-organized structures and procedures for looking at student work and collaborating to create 
interventions.  

Needs  

Across all classrooms, we need to have all students getting high, quality instruction that allows for student voice and 
ownership. Because of this need, our priority is to ensure that administrators and model teachers support our students 
through differentiated professional development, coaching, and modeling that promotes student ownership in the 
classroom.  

Priority  

For the 2018-2019 school year, cohort teams will use small group instructional strategies to embed student analytical 
skills in departmental curriculum. Each cohort team performs strategic inquiry with a goal to improve student writing. 
Each Cohort team has the potential to use data from the following sources: District Public data that includes REDS item 
analysis from Regents, DDC through Datacation, common assessments from departments, writing rubrics, and report 
cards.  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          36 

 

Twice a month cohort groups will utilize Success Mentoring to check in with at risk "yellow" students to determine 
deficiencies and identify supports needed to increase student outcomes. 

In addition to cohort meetings, Department teams meet twice a week to collaboratively use Datawise strategic inquiry 
to revise and adjust unit plans, lesson, activities, and assessments for CCLS-based instruction based on student needs. 
Our goal is for all teachers to be involved in collaboration regarding delivery of instruction, skills focus, methods of 
practice, and student products and objectives. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

Our teachers work collaboratively in their department and cohort teams with an inquiry approach to best determine the 
needs and interventions for all students. Teachers share best practices and participate in intervisitations to provide peer 
to peer feedback on how they are helping students. 

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
For the 2018-19 school year, our cabinet inquiry group will conduct weekly walk-throughs focusing on questioning, 
engagement, and assessment techniques in our classrooms. Our goal is to better identify the needs and interventions 
for teachers in order to create meaningful and differentiated professional development for our school. We use self-
created tennis charts, note-catchers, and Google spreadsheets to collect data and define our expectations for all 
teachers. This data will be used to create an email to debrief our teachers of our findings. We will work with our Peer 
Collaborative Teacher and Model Teachers to create school-level professional learning events geared to target teacher 
needs.  

 

 

How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
MVB will be utilizing two separate structures of teacher collaboration focused on on determining student needs, 
strategies to implement and co-creating Tennis charts.  

One structure uses the Datawise inquiry process using a variety of data tools to identify a student-learning problem and 
a problem of practice for each department. Based on PD, we will have our PCT, Model Teachers, and volunteer teachers 
showcase classroom procedures with routines established for inter-visitations and review their curriculum/scope and 
sequence and look at student work to build on next steps for content and skill building. This will occur twice every week 
and will all be a part of our PL calendar and learning cycles.  

Our other structures places teachers into cohort team to address small group instruction and social-emotional issues 
among common students. In alternating weeks, teachers will meet weekly to look at student work through small group 
instruction and to discuss student behavioral trends through our Success Mentoring program. ENL and ISS teachers are 
embedded into cohort teams to ensure that teachers are norming best practices and using student data to improve 
personal instruction.  

Our Model Teachers are embedded into each Departmental and Cohort team to create professional development, 
provide exemplary strategies to use in the classroom, and to strategically work with teachers about their practice.

Using our Datawise protocols, our Datawise champions and instructional assistant principals will work with 
departmental teams through the inquiry process. First, teacher teams will meet to create a data overview that selects a 
focus area and priority question. After digging through data, teachers will develop a learner-centered problem around 
where students are getting stuck. This will lead into examining instruction where teachers will participate in inter 
visitations and share lesson plans, unit plans, and other assessments to identify an instructional problem of practice. 
Teachers create action plans based on a research-based strategy that addresses the student learner problem and 
problem of practice. Teachers implement and assess this action plan as the cycle continues throughout the year. 
Teacher teams will complete at least two Datawise cycles. Because of this inquiry, scores on the Living Environment 
exams rose 20 percent while Earth Science rose 6 percent. 

In Cohort teams, our instructional assistant principals and Model Teachers will lead school-wide professional learning 
events strengthening teachers' in the use of small group instruction strategies. Cohort teams will have quarterly inquiry 
showcases and presentations to show teams data analysis, progress monitoring and methods of implementation based 
off inquiry and learning cycles. 

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Through our Community Based Organization Director, we will engage parents and families through bi-annual Family 
Community Nights at MVB where parents get to discuss progress update and classroom expectations with teachers. 
These events occur in September and May.  

We invite parents for our bi-annual Recognition Nights, which celebrate student successes in the classrooms in 
November and April. The ceremony highlights not just academic successes but students who have shown 
improvement in the classroom or have done exemplary work outside of the classroom. Recognition Night is run by an 
assistant principal who works with the Parent Coordinator and volunteer teachers.  

In Cohort teams, assistant principals, model teachers, counselors, and teacher staff will participate in Success 
Mentoring activities that will target students who need interventions to graduate. This will results in parent-teacher 
conferences throughout the year. ENL coordinator will create events for parents to give information in a variety of 
languages. School newsletters will highlight changes in curriculum based on student needs.  
 

 
Part 5 – Budget and Resource Alignment

support that drives student achievement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 2 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable, 

Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive 
of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (RSCEP). 
Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital 
resources. 

2.3 

2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 

Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and 
track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback. 

2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve critical 
individual and school-wide practices as defined in the RSCEP (student achievement, curriculum 
and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement; and student 
social and emotional developmental health).

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district’s Annual Professional Performance Review 
(APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observations and track progress of teacher practices based on student data 
and feedback. 

Strengths: In 2017-18, we began a cabinet inquiry that included the Principal, APs and DSR to norm looking at Danielson 
component 1E and Domain 3 via walk-throughs and observations. The cabinet spoke with students about how they 
were progressing in writing, if they understood their teacher's feedback, and if they were self-assessing in the 
classroom. Cabinet also took teacher notes on observable actionable feedback, differentiation, and meaningful 
grouping. This information led to the creation of PDs around self-assessment rubrics and Hochman strategies based on 
real-time student needs. We will be continuing this trend in the 2018-19 school year. 

 

In 2017-18, we created an Instructional Leadership team consisting of the principal, instructional assistant principals, 
teachers, counselors, and the DSR to align professional development and other initiatives with our instructional 
focus, data-based needs, and student work.  

 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          45 

 

Needs: Although we implemented the above policies, we need more coherence throughout the school regarding 
planning, classroom expectations and procedures, use of best practices and strategies and scaffolding and 
differentiating for our diverse learners. 

In 2018-19, our cabinet will continue to meet in monthly pairs to do walk-throughs to better identify the needs and 
interventions for our teachers, specifically looking at practices aligned with Danielson 1E and Domain 3. The data will 
be used to 1) create a newsletter at the end of the month to debrief staff our findings and 2) work with our Peer 
Collaborative Teacher (PCT), Danielle Vargas, along with our two Model Teachers (MoT) to create school-level 
professional learning events geared to target teacher populations. 3) create and implement PL event in department 
meetings to strengthen teacher practices.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

Through our Instructional Leadership Team, Cabinet, and Datawise inquiry process, the vision is for a Professional 
Learning Community that uses inquiry and learning cycles as methods for determining gaps and trends and collaborating 
to respond with interventions and supports for all of our stakeholders. 

 

 
 

On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year? 
Aligning all department teams using collaborative models, skill-building, and multi-tiered observing with all Assistant 
Principals, then focusing on their development and practice. 

 

 

What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s 
vision, mission, and instructional focus?  
The vision is for a Professional Learning Community that uses inquiry and learning cycles as methods for determining 
gaps and trends and collaborating to respond with interventions and supports for all of our stakeholders. 

 

 
 

What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher 
leaders to build broad capacity within your school?  
It is the Principal’s expectation that Assistant Principals will lead in building capacity with our PCT, Model Teachers, as 
well as Department and Cohort Team Leaders. Teacher-Leaders will work in departments and Cohort teams to develop 
peer inquiry, strengthen skills across curriculum, and improve the culture of learning in the building . Teacher-leaders 
are provided leadership training and advised to take SAM training for certification.  

 

 

How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together 
with other stakeholders? 
The principal will conduct ongoing needs assessments and share progress as well as challenges with all stakeholders. 
The School Leadership Team, The Community Engagement Team, and Parent Teachers Association, will all be integral 
parts of the process.

serve targeted populations of families and students once a quarter. We will be hosting an Open House in late September 
for students, families and community partners followed by our second Community School Forum in late April. 
Throughout the year, we will also invite local businesses, local places of worship, mental health experts and family 
outreach groups to present their work to our families. One community group we anticipate collaborating with this 
school year is Strategic Destiny (goal setting and youth development services), a Queens based CBO founded by Dr. 
Alfonso Wyatt. We will also be conducting a speaker series featuring Queens natives covering a variety of school 
community topics. We will be welcoming College Summit's Peer Forward program which will partly support student-led 
school wide campaigns for parent engagement with the college application process. 

 

The school will partner with the CBO to support student success by being present at all events hosted by the school. The 
CBO will support the school in identifying attendance issues and making referral for support services to families and 
students when necessary. The CBO will be instrumental in supporting the school with celebrating both small and large 
wins in terms student success.  

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
Within the Community School model, for the third year in a row, families are welcomed into the Martin Van Buren 
community through our Summer Bridge program for incoming freshmen, freshmen orientation, August Open House, by 
offering an open door policy to parents, having parent volunteers, inviting parents on college trips, by hosting parent-
student trips, family day and by hosting parent workshops that support families and offering free services families can 
benefit from (i.e. Free tax preparation, roads to citizenship, Skedula, etc.). In addition, the school will host events that 
are centered around reintroduction of the Community School title, invite local politicians and people of influence to 
speak to parents, and informing parents of opportunities for them and their children. School safety and all students will 
have received a document by September which expresses the expectations of staff when parents are present in the 
building. We will be hosting two Community Forums in September and April for students, families and community 
partners. The school will provide the Parent Coordinator and the CBO with a dedicated space to where families will be 
welcomed. Our school's compilation of Mental Health Providers, known as the Wellness Team, will be expanding its 
services by supporting school personnel with creating a more welcoming environment for students and families, 
research-based practices in positive youth and parent engagement and informational presentations on relevant health 
and mental health issues. 

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
 
School will identify families who have been significant contributors to the Parent Teacher Association. Their 
development will be led and monitored through their participation in the school’s School Leadership Team (SLT) and the

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, as a result of implementation of a comprehensive ELT program focusing on increasing student 
achievement in ELA and math across all grades, there will be a 3 % increase in credit accumulation as measured by 
STARS data. 

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type 

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?

Renewal ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students, 
including special populations, will participate fully in Renewal ELT. 
Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will 
actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students. 
Our ELT Program is compulsory and students are strategically programmed into their ELT classes which are placed on 
students’ program card. 

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description 

Target Population: The ELT program for a Renewal School will be offered to all students in the school. 

Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program: 
How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make 
learning relevant and engaging?   
How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day? 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as 

to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of 
graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and 

language mandates are met during ELT? 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the 

supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to 

school faculty and community partner staff? 

  What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners? 
  How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement? 
  How will effective outreach be conducted to families? 
  How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage 

participation? 

We will continue to have our in-school day support through S.O.A.R., A.C.E., Project Hope, as well as sessions with our 
CBO’s LMHC. Our CBO will support attendance and academic needs through cohort wide success mentoring initiative, 
attendance initiatives, outreach, counseling, and one-on-one meetings with families. 

We will be scheduling target populations who need academic intervention with Think Through Math and Rewards 
reading program. We will supplement our classrooms with myon.com, Snap&Read and Newsela to support our 
readers. 

 

In addition to our 8+1 school day, we will have a credit bearing Saturday school for students who are credit deficient, 
college classes and enrichment programs for students who are on track and SAT classes as well as supplemental 
Saturday classes for ENL students and skill building in literacy and math for students in need. We will have an after 
school Tuesday enrichment language program for our ENL population. 

 

We offer a larger breadth of electives that build into our career pathways and offer enrichment. We are in year 2 of 
building our CTE Law program with the Justice Resource Center. The program includes a three-year curriculum and 
will soon offer opportunities for work based learning programs and partnerships. Final Assessments are currently 
being developed by the JRC and staff.  

 

With the new schedule, all classes will be taught by NYS certified pedagogues who will receive their professional 
development through MVB and supplemental groups, as needed. 

 
Students and families have been sent our new bell schedule. It is available on Skedula and will be posted on our 
MVBHigh.com website. The day program is fully accessible and non-negotiable.

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal 
program. 
1. 

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together 
with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead 
implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community

4. 

School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

The Community School Director (CSD) will be responsible for successfully coordinating the work and programs of all 
CBO partners with school administration and faculty to improve students academic performance, social and 
emotional well being, and improve school climate and culture. During implementation, the CSD offers development 
and technical support to administrators, team leaders, teacher teams, counselors, and support staff to support 
collaboration. The CSD meets with teacher grade teams the first and third Thursday of each month to implement 
Success Mentoring Program which pairs teachers with 3 students who have been identified as having early warning 
indicators. Teachers will check in with students two times a week, complete mid marking period check-ins, report 
card conferencing, parent outreach when their student is absent and complete a Google form documenting the 
outcome and next steps. The use of the Google From creates accountability for CSD, teachers, family, and student. 
CSD, CBO and teacher grade teams case conference individual students, discuss strategies to help support the 
students behavior, attendance and academic performance. CSD provides support around the social and emotional 
needs of students and collaborate with staff to discuss interventions to utilize in the classroom. The team develops a 
strategic plan, implements an early warning system to identify struggling students, and regularly review the data to 
inform next steps with each small learning community. This professional development increases the school’s capacity 
to build positive school climate, collaborative teaching practices, develop and sustain distributive leadership, and 
engage in ongoing collective decision making and actions that support student success. 

 

The CSD is the primary liaison between CBO partners, school leadership, and staff of the school. The CSD is 
responsible for coordinating mental health and student support programs, implementing tiered interventions, 
organizing school activities, and offering services and support to students and families. This process begins with a full 
needs assessment, collaborative analysis, and work plan development based on the findings from the co-
interpretation and on-site visit. The CSD will create a streamlined referral system for staff to connect students to care 
and resources in school. The CSD assists with assessing students and referring students to appropriate programs that 
can best support their needs and improve outcomes. Programs offer services around mental health, recreation, 
leadership, community service, peer mentoring, college and career readiness, academic and attendance support. ELT 
programming is embedded within the school day. The extended class period and extended learning opportunities 
allow for sufficient time not only for explicit instruction, but also modeling, demonstrating and exploring. The CSD will 
provide opportunities for peer tutoring, regents preparation and SAT courses through Princeton Review.  

 

The CSD helps organize and facilitate family meetings to involve them in supporting students in academic 
achievement. CSD partners with The School Leadership Team, PTA, Administration, and school faculty to organize and 
execute events that welcome families into MVB. CSD assists with community school night, parent-teacher 
conferences, recognition nights, and the community school forum. The CSD works closely with the Engagement 
Specialist and Outreach Counselor to plan family meetings, parent workshops, invite families to the school for coffee 
chat, and connect families with resources within the school and in the community. CSD assists the Engagement 
Specialist, Guidance Counselors and Teacher Teams in outreaching to families and welcoming them into the school to 
discuss the needs of their child. CSD also helps connect families with resources in the community through agency, 
Central Queens YM & YWHA and any other agencies that are most convenient to their home or work.

The CSD utilizes New Vision Data to analyze attendance trends across cohorts and identify students at risk in order to 
intervene to connect student with support and resources. CSD inputs the intervention(s) that students are receiving 
and can track the attendance and performance of students receiving additional supports and services compared to 
the general body of the school. The CSD will collect outcome, planning, and implementation data to provide useful 
timely feedback to the administration at MVB, staff, and partner/community organizations. CSD will collect and 
review early warning data (attendance, credit accumulation, suspensions, cohort tracker data, course performance) 
to share weekly with the Principal, select AP's, and other CBO's. The data pulled helps guide the CSD along with 
Administration to develop tiered attendance interventions that will be impactful. The data collected is also reviewed 
by Teacher Grade teams on a weekly basis to create, coordinate, and monitor interventions for students who are in 
the Success Mentoring Program.  

 

 
 
Part 3 – Community School Program Implementation and Oversight 

Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

The school administration and Community School Director will partner in implementing the Community School 
program. Data collection and analysis informs the CBO and school leadership in prioritizing identified needs. The 
community partners involved in offering supportive services to students are Central Queens YM & YWHA (SOAR 
Program, ACE Program, Level Up), Northwell/LIJ and Project Hope - The New Direction (YLCP and MBK). Each agency 
program offers differentiated targeted and selective services to students. The ACE and SOAR Program through Central 
Queens YM & YWHA are mental health counseling programs that also provide academic support, report card 
conferencing, college and career readiness, and family engagement. Level Up is a youth development program 
utilizing a student driven approach that involves students in peer mentoring, community service projects that the 
students can participate in, and academic support. LIJ/Northwell offers psychiatric mental health services through 
behavioral health evaluations, counseling, crisis intervention, and psycho education. The YLCP model is career and 
post-education driven and consist of an extensive intake process, case management services, mentoring, and referrals 
and activities will be based on each client's assessment needs. MBK offers a peer to peer mentoring program of 
approximately 40 Freshman and Sophomore Black and Hispanic boys mentored by Seniors and Juniors and come 
together for the unique purpose of redefining success and to address the academic and social-emotional needs of 
students. MBK focuses on creating personalized interventions to reduce chronic absenteeism, increase on track credit 
accumulation and improve performance on Regents exams.  

To strengthen this process, the CBO's have created The Wellness Team and meets once a week on Wednesdays. At 
this meeting, CBO's discuss referrals received by the school staff and determine appropriate program placement and 
work together to plan events. The Wellness Teams come together to organize events for the entire student body such 
as tiered attendance interventions, documentary screenings/discussions, activities around national events (Unity Day, 
Red RIbbon Week, World Health Day, Mental Health Awareness Month), college workshops, community service 
projects, school carnival. 

 

The Community School Team's (CST) membership includes school principal, assistant principals, faculty and staff, 
students, parents, Parent Coordinator and community partners. Stakeholders work together to align and integrate 
the work of all partners to best support student need and create an environment that is safe and prepares students 
for l Meetings take place monthly, usually the 1st Monday of the month in the evening to accommodate members' 
work schedules. The meeting runs for about 2 hours. Meeting objectives primarily focus on reviewing and 
recommending suggestions for school-wide planning documents such as the RSCEP or quarterly Receivership reports.

All members share about programming and initiatives that will be taking place and collaborate on ways to plan, 
outreach, and implement the event in a way that can include all stakeholders.  

 

By using New Visions, the school is able to strategically place students in appropriate programs based on their student 
data profiles. The Success Mentoring Program uses data to identify students based on attendance, regents 
completion, and progress towards graduation. Students are selected by teachers who have the students in their class 
that they need to graduate in order to be the most effective. The Level Up At Lunch Program uses attendance data to 
target students in 9th - 12th grade that have been identified as chronically absent and at risk, the lowest third, and 
students in temporary housing. The CSD is able to use New Visions to share with ACE and SOAR about students who 
need more support around attendance and academics in addition to mental health counseling. This data is analyzed 
on a bi-weekly basis to assess for change in attendance and evaluate intervention effectiveness.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:

          74 

 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Martin Van Buren HS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Martin Van Buren High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; parents will be made aware of myOn.com; Skedula/Pupilpath; and other online 
resources 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; through Community night events 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          76 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

In developing the Title I PIP, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent-Teacher 
Association (PTA), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I 
PIP and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school 
quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the RSCEP, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and 
School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent-
Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional 
development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will 
provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will 
work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also 
maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under the ESSA Act; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          77 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The Instructional Focus at Martin Van Buren High School is, “<!--
{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->If teachers consistently 
implement differentiated rigorous tasks that include student dialogue, assessment and meaningful 
feedback, then student constructed responses will improve, building a shared ownership of 
learning that prepares students for career and college success.” This supports our beliefs about 
student learning.  Furthermore, we enstill that our ELLs require skills-based instruction, 
including scaffolded and tiered lessons that promote the use of leveled texts and above level texts 
in order to build capacity while meeting the needs of rigorous scholarship.  Martin Van Buren's 
instructional program is aligned with the New York City's Department of Education's Citywide 
Instructional Expectations (CIE). We hold to the belief that high expectations, the CIEs are for 
all learners, including English Language Learners.  We believe that all students will learn 
through using differentiated instructional strategies combined with positive adult-student 
connections. Our ELLs who participate in the following Title III supplemental programs will 
benefit from these initiatives. 
After-School Program: 
Martin Van Buren High School will continue to utilize a Common-Core aligned supplemental 
academic ENL program run after school.  The program will target 15 ENL Seniors from our 
lowest third performing population and will be run from 3:45pm to 4:45pm on Tuesdays with a 
content teacher and certified ENL teacher.  The focus and rationale of the program will center on 
increasing the number of our ELLs passing Regents examinations in January 2019 and June 
2019. 
These 15 target students were chosen from the New Visions Data Sorter using information such 
as ENL levels and analysis from ELA and Math Regents. We will utilize data to identify the 
specific skills in the content areas as well as in literacy, specifically in reading and written 
expression to plan Common-Core aligned lessons. Student data from those who failed previous 
Regents will be utilized from the NYC ATS REDS reports, which will be run to gain an item 
analysis of each test for each student. This will allow for the ELA teacher to identify the content 
deficits to implement Regents strategies and skills and the ENL teacher to provide 
scaffold supports for linguistic skills that students require to be successful. The ELA teacher will 
attend workshops through Nancy Cloud on exploring strategies for assisting ELLs with close 
readings of novels, speeches, informational and documentary text to advance students' academic 
vocabularies and writing skills. 
In addition, for students who have taken specific Regents, we will have students take a mock or 
practice Regents to provide formative pre- and post-assessments. Supplemental courses to be co-
taught with a licensed ENL teacher and content area teachers will be developed around ELA, 
Social Studies, and Living Environment and align with language objectives, as needed by the 
students per ATS, RNMR, and NYSESLAT report analysis. The subject-specific materials we 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          83 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
will utilize include: Castle Learning online, content-area textbooks, Barrons Regents Let's 
Review series, and previous Regents examinations.  Given that the small-group instruction is 
open to all grade levels, a dedicated supervisor is needed to oversee the program because of PM 
school occurring on the same days. 
Instruction will be provided in a smaller, more individualized, setting to allow for greater 
differentiation and to target the skills each student requires.  Ratios for instructional time for 
ESL/Bilingual and content areas will be 50/50 while providing grouping by home language 
supports. Subgroups targeted: ELL students in grades 9 through 12. Instructional groups will be 
based on heterogeneous grade levels, as they will be put together based on the specific subject 
area and English proficiency level that needs to be targeted.  
Like last year, there will be a rotation of student groups so that all students receive appropriate 
language development support from the certified ENL teacher. 
The Title III ENL after-school program will run on the following 25 Tuesdays, from 3:45PM to 
4:45PM, between the months of November and June in the 2018-2019 SY. 
Saturday ENL Program: 
In addition, there will be a supplemental Title III Saturday ENL Academy program supervised 
by Assistant Principal of ELA/ENL, Brian Panepinto, facilitated by certified ENL teacher, Tara 
Lallbachan, and one content area teacher, Neal Nachman (Science) running from 8:00AM to 
1:00PM.  There will be a focus on basic interpersonal conversational skills, Common-Core 
aligned content, and cognitive academic language acquisition.  The supplemental ENL Saturday 
program will offer five hours of English immersion, authentic learning trips, projects, and 
academic skills building. The sessions will be open to all ELLs and former ELLs, however there 
will be a focus on 40 Entering/Emerging/Transitioning level students and approximately 20 
Expanding/Commanding students.  The students will be paired based on English Language 
Proficiency levels and home languages (EN/EM/TR levels will be systematically paired with 
EX/CO level student mentors).  They will have discussion guidelines and academic vocabulary 
to study and practice using the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit resource books by Dr. Kate 
Kinsella.  They will be assigned to rotating groups between small-group content, ENL teacher 
instruction, myOn.com Project Building, and Common-Core aligned regents review.  Students 
will also use the Mac Labs, PC labs, and tablets to increase their ability to utilize technology and 
ELL support software.  We are also looking into a Kaplan Skills program. 
There will be blocks of time devoted to cultural awareness, academic vocabulary, content 
building, buddy mentoring and discussion time. 
The Title III Saturday program will be held on the following 21 Saturdays during the 2018-
2019 SY: 
In total for the Direct Instruction Supplemental Programs: 190 hours of per session will go 
towards 3 teachers for 3 hours on Saturdays, and 50 hours towards 2 teachers after school on 
Tuesdays. 
The start date for the Title III program will be November 2018. 
The end date for the program will be June 2019. 
The Language of Instruction will be in English. 
Teachers' certification will be in ESL. There will be additional content-area teachers to co-teach 
the program. Their certifications will be Mathematics, English, the Sciences (Living 
Environment and Earth Science), as well as Social Studies.

During our Professional learning periods that occur weekly, every Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 
we are reviewing best practices for co-teaching and how to differentiate and scaffold for 
ELLs.  Materials from EngageNY and writing strategies from Hochman are being researched, 
utilized and discussed.  Teachers will also use this time to complete specific ELL inquiry work, 
aligned with improving WitSi writing strategies. One ENL teacher, Danielle Vargas, and 
ELA/ENL AP, Brian Panepinto, will use their Hochman training through NYC ORS to turnkey 
strategies and best practices to all ENL content teachers so that they may make data-driven 
decisions to improve instruction.  Agendas and student work from inquiry cycles will be 
documented via hard copy and Google Apps for Education. We will be utilizing literacy 
programs such as Achieve 3000 and "REWARDS" this year in co-taught ENL/ELA 
classes.  REWARDS introduces students to a unique multisyllabic word reading strategies, 
enhancing English phonemic awareness.  Professional Learning will be offered to all ENL 
teachers and their ELA co-teachers to facilitate this program to our struggling ELLs during 
supplemental Title III program time, once they are trained.  Teachers will also receive ongoing 
professional development from the Internationals Network for Public Schools. 
In addition, professional learning opportunities for ENL, as well as content area co-teachers, will 
be available throughout the year, including those offered periodically by the NYC DOE Division 
of English Language Learners and Students Support. Teachers will attend and to then turnkey 
information during our Common Planning Time. 
The on-going focus for PDs are: Common-Core Standard and ENL curriculum alignment, 
Regents granular data analysis, Building Capacity and Scaffolding for ELLS, Resources for 
ELLS, Utilizing technology as a tool to support ELLS, Leveling texts for ELLS, and building 
Academic Vocabulary.

Begin description here:            
  
At Martin Van Buren High School, we firmly believe that parents of English Language Learners 
should play an active role in their child’s education. Furthermore, we believe that specifically-
targeted, supplemental parent workshops for parents of ELLs are to enhance what is already 
presented for parents in the regularly scheduled DOE calendar (such as Parent/Teacher 
Conferences). Our parents have mentioned to us during interviews and meetings that they

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
appreciate it when we open our doors to them so they can learn the expectations of a NYC DOE 
high school education as well as learn what their children will need to matriculate naturally into 
colleges and careers in the future. We also know that it is best practice to inform parents on a 
regular basis of their child's progress through his or her education. As such, our Title III program 
will offer several opportunities throughout the year to participate in this supplemental program. 
We believe it is imperative to facilitate open-communication between our school and families. 
We notify parents of important school events and provide critical information to parents by 
phone calls using the School Phone Master Messenger (this is translated into Spanish and 
French, our dominant languages). In addition, to inform parents of pertinent information and 
events, we use an online school Datacation platform, PupilPath via Skedula to email parents, 
translated into all designated home languages, as well as send home letters and other information 
through the US Postal Service.  Our parent coordinator or teacher/administrator will discuss any 
issue of concern with parents.  Each ENL parent is also notified of workshops through 
backpacking of translated letters and fliers. We provide parents of ELLs workshops and trainings 
on content area strategies and college and career readiness. We also always provide translation 
and interpretation services for parents of ELLs at workshops and parent meetings through 
student and teacher volunteers. Records, such as agendas, attendance sheets and invitations, will 
be documented via hard copy, Datacation and Google Apps for Education. 
 
Schedule and duration:  Along with DOE scheduled open school nights and parent-teacher 
conferences, we will also hold monthly Saturday parent/family meetings after student Saturday 
Academy sessions November 2018 - June 2019 from 12:00PM to 1:00PM. 
Topics to be covered are: Using NYC Translation Services - "English Survival Skills for ELLs 
and their families," Completion of the School Meals Applications, and Using Technology to 
bridge parent connections (Skedula/PupilPath Log In and Tutorial). 
Our focus for Saturday ELL family sessions is to engage students and parents to increase 
awareness, development and involvement with the school and academics.  To this end, we will 
have occasional trips to museums, colleges and theaters as well as having pot lucks and 
interactive events.  Topics and Activities to be covered during the following monthly Saturday 
Sessions will be: Immigration Support (legal services), Supporting the ELL students with 
technology (i.e. using Skedula/PupilPath in their home languages, myOn.com, etc.), ELL student 
resources, Multicultural culture shock/Pot Luck Family Day, Learning English/Computer 
Support Programs and the Queens Library, LIJ Health Services, Getting your ELL onto to the 
path for college and career/FAFSA and scholarship information sessions, and more. 
Our dedicated College Guidance Counselor also provides workshops on Saturdays (other 
funding sources are utilized to fund this college advisory program) to inform parents of the steps 
they need to take from when their child is in Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior year to 
follow a prepared path to college and career readiness. A certified ENL teacher will be available 
to push-in to these sessions twice per year.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Martin Van Buren High School is a large comprehensive high school that offers academic and college and career ready 
programs to all of its students. We have 1180 students, 154 of which are English Language Learners; Entering through 
Expanding (13.05%). We have 30 students that are in Commanding (Former ELLs) receiving the additional instructional support 
regulated by Part 154, as well as ELL testing accomodations. We use formative assessments to target instruction to ELLs across 
our ENL Small Learning Community classrooms through WIT writing strategy-based data driven instruction. SLC teachers 
convene twice weekly for professional development on cyclic WIT strategies and conduct inquiry based on student work. ELLs 
are assessed consistently on all four modalities through Socratic Seminar accountable conversation strategies, 
monthly myON.com reading assessments, and the aforementioned WIT writing skills. Integrated ENL/ELA classes use 
"Quickwrites" evidence-based reading response assessments at various points within units of study adapted from EngageNY. 
Teacher created baseline assessments are administered at Entering through Expanding ENL levels. This helps inform our 
instruction plan by allowing us to create benchmarks and goals for the students. REWARDS Reading Intervention, Listenwise,

          89 

Zinc Learning Labs Vocabulary Study and Academic Vocabulary Toolkit programs are used on a weekly basis to assess reading 
vocabulary and comprehension. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL SLC teachers, comprised of 4 ENL teachers and all content area ELL teachers, convene twice weekly for professional 
development on school-wide WIT writing strategy instruction.  Once PD is delivered, teachers incorporate WIT strategies 
across curiculum and reconvene with ELL student work for whole-group inquiry.  Thursdays are designated Accountable 
Independent Reading and Response periods in all ELA and ENL classes building-wide.  This promotes regular formative reading 
assessments. Fridays are designated listening/speaking program days in ENL classrooms where students practice accountable 
speaking, such as oral presentations or Socratic Seminars and use Listenwise, a website that offers curated public radio stories 
and podcasts and listening comprehension assessments.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use teacher-created baselines and unit assessments derived from EngageNY across our integrated ENL ELA classes to 
assess literacy skills of our ELLs.  Most often, the data provides us with student specific insight  as well as reinforcing the 
awareness that our students need additional assistance in ELA, specifically in reading comprehension, basic writing structure 
and capacity to build sentences into content based responses that become paragraphs and essays. We also use teacher 
created Common Core-aligned baselines, with varying Lexile levels, to assess proficiency based on Common Core Learning 
Standards in both literature and informational texts.  We also administer the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test to monitor 
reading progress from fall to spring, each year.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Summative assessments are used by teachers to plan for the following school year by looking at trends and needs at the end of 
the year.  REDS reports are read and analyzed for ELL NYS Regents exam passing rates across subjects. During Department 
meetings, teachers will follow the Datawise model for using student data to create action plans that include identifying 
student-learner problems and teacher intervisitation to address problems of practice. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and NYS Regents exam score data to assess early literacy skills of our new ELLs.  We access and 
review this data via the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) which yeilds data from RLAT and RESI ATS reports for the entire student 
body.  We then use this data to filter and focus on the progress toward achievement of proficiency for our ELLs.  We further 
filter specific subgroups of ELLs (e.g. Long-term ELLs, SIFE, At-Risk Indicative ELLs) in order to design effective instructional 
programs and interventions for those students. We use NYSESLAT modality breakdown scores to fine-tune and differentiate 
instruction by identifying students needs in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We use the EDAT in conjunction with the NCLB Graduation Tracker and regents data REDS reports to disagregate ELL student 
data to identify target at-risk groups at each grade level.  Our building-wide color system helps us identify ELLs who are on 
track, in terms of their credit accumulation and regents completion, as "green" level, those who are on the cusp, as "yellow," 
and those who are in danger, and off-track for graduation as a result of low credit accumulation and regents completion, as 
"red."  We immediately address ELLs who fall under the "red" category via parent and guidance meetings.  Interventions are 
held throughout the year to remediate our "yellow" leveled ELLs via report card conferences with all ENL SLC teachers, and 
Early Warning Intervention meetings with our Community-Based Organization.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At Martin Van Buren High School, ENL students are programmed together in a Small Learning Community named The 
Ambassadors.  ENL students are grouped based on profiency and contiguous grade levels for their integrated ELA and 
self-contained ENL classes. We offer freestanding and integrated ENL classes based on these levels.  In efforts to help 
build our students capacity, we offer more than the mandated number of ENL minutes to all of our ELLs and 
Commanding students.  The students are programmed based on their grade level, NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT 
scores.  Entering and Emerging level ELLs receive two 48-minute periods of ENL with a licensed ENL teacher, in 
addition to one 48-minute period of integrated ENL ELA cotaught by a licensed ENL teacher per day; far exceeding the 
mandated minutes per week in accordanced with Part 154.  Transitioning level ELLs receive one 48-minute period of 
ENL with a licensed ENL teacher and one 48-minute period of integrated ENL ELA cotaught by a licensed ENL teacher 
per day;  Expanding and Commanding (Former ELL) level receives one 48-minute integrated ENL ELA class per day, 
cotaught by a licensed ENL teacher, again, far exceeding Part 154 mandates.  ENL students receive further linguistic 
support with the addition of 2 cotaught Social Studies classes, one Global History and one US History, by a licensed 
ENL teacher.  The Ambassadors SLC consists of content area teachers in: Living Environment, Earth Science, Global 
History, US History, Government and Economics, and Math-- who all teach self-contained, all-ELL classes.

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All students are programmed based on the BESIS minute needs following the CR Part154 ENL Units of study.  All minutes 
reported below are weekly minutes.  Martin Van Buren High School has 48 minute class sessions.Entering and Emerging ELLs 
receive 480 minutes of stand-alone ENL class time plus 240 Integrated ENL ELA minutes (Total of 720 minutes).  Transitioning 
ELLs receive a total of 240 minutes ENL stand-alone, plus 240 Integrated ENL ELA minutes (Total of 480 minutes).  Expanding 
and Commanding (Former ELL) students receive a total of 240 minutes of Integrated ENL ELA minutes.   
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All classes are delivered in English.  Students are given scaffolded work with glossaries and available translations, we use the 
Regents glossaries and home language exams.  Classrooms are equipped with SmartBoards or LCD projectors to facilitate 
sheltered instruction through the use of visual aids and to supplement/enrich instruction.  Entering, Emerging and 
Transitioning teachers use total physical response to help guide students and support communication.  Students are paired or 
grouped with a same language (when available) and higher proficiency-level students to facilitate guidance where there is low 
language acquisition (heterogenous and homogenous grouping and differentiation).  We are using the Frayer Vocabulary 
Model, RACES writing outline, WITsi for strategic inquiry and the WIT “because, but and so” sentence structures to move our 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          91 

 

students through the writing process with a structure they can follow and use in all disciplines.  We use the MEAL paragraph 
writing outline across subjects in the SLC to support consise argumentative, expository, and narrative writing.  This aligns with 
our school’s instructional focus of using multiple methods and providing scaffolding and feedback to help our students make 
evidence-based claims.  The ENL teachers support the content and initiatives by offering differentiated scaffolding, graphic 
organizers, cultural and language insights, while supporting the basic language content.  The teachers are using the students’ 
native languages as a support this year by allowing less proficient students to translate questions and then work towards 
acquiring the content and language needed to answer the questions.  The ENL SLC is also practicing reciprocal teaching to help 
students understand tasks and skills needed.  This method is aligned with the CCLS in Speaking and Listening in addition to the 
CC goal of knowing what you are learning and why.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We administer Regents Exams that are offered in the students native/preferred language.  For teacher created assessments 
we offer the students key vocabulary words translated through the use of NYSED Regents glossaries, Regents exams, teacher-
created exams, and bilingual dictionaries.  This year we are focusing on translating the tasks for our less proficient ELLs, as their 
starting point.  Through the use of the Translation and Interpretation Unit and internet devices, in various degrees, Google 
Translate as a means to translate concepts and student and teacher responses.  As stated earlier, this year the teachers are 
guiding the less proficient students to translate topics and questions and work towards answering them.  A goal for this year is 
to also have specific formative and summative assessments translated by the Translation and Interpretation Unit.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE: As indicated on our school EDAT, we do not currently have any students who are identified as SIFE. Should we receive 
any SIFE students in the coming years, we are prepared to provide them with classroom support, Kate Kinsella’s Academic 
Vocabulary Toolkit interventions, Saturday classes, PM school classes and Title III "ENL Saturday Social," an enrichment 
program for ELLs.  We also offer peer tutoring through the Scholars program, teacher led tutoring during their sixth period 
lunch and technology support in classes.b.  Newcomers:  We differentiate for our newcoming ELLs by providing smaller class 
sizes, myON leveled ebooks, language enrichment services and extended learning time to promote language acquisition and 
cultural enrichment.  These students have a double period ENL teacher who works on building their language skills and 
communicating with the school at large by creating usable glossaries for the school.  We program all Newcomers who do not 
have a Saturday class into our Saturday Social where they work on communication language and Kinsella’s Academic 
Vocabulary.  The Saturday Social also serves as an exposure program where they go on trips to museums and conduct project 
based learning. All students are given bilingual dictionaries to carry to and from school each day in their home language.c. 
Developing:  Students receive resources to promote their academic Vocabulary and CCSS aligned proficiency.  They are given a 
rigorous course schedule with supplemental services, and Saturday support classes, as needed. Developing students are 
expected accumulate credits and regents passing on grade level.d.  Long Term - We identify our Long-Term ELLs via the EDAT 
and dissimnate each students' data to all of their teachers.  Teachers area expected to differentiate for the extra support L-
TELLs need to push forth, in particular with their academic vocabulary. They will be continuing to use the Academic Vocabulary 
Toolkit and receive support in their Title III PM and  supplemental Saturday classes.e.  Former ELLs - Former ELLs, or 
Commanding ELLs, as we refer to them, continue to receive mandated ENL minutes and testing accomodations and 
support.  Our Commanding students are in an ENL class co-taught by an ENL and ELA teacher.  They are given the most 
rigorous schedule with language supports.  They also receive the testing accomodations they are entitled to for the following 
two years, which entails time and a half on all NYS Regents exams and the use of a word-to-word bilingual glossary.  Students 
who are Commanding and F-ELLs are also programmed, when achievable, into our Saturday Social programs in ELA and 
Science.             
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          92 

 

Teachers use academic questions and content that is broken down and scaffolded through the use of skill building, language 
level variation, and visual aids to ensure that there are multiple entry points for the students to acquire information and 
develop skills.  In addition, teachers will train on developing common assessments and rubrics that allow for actionable 
feedback and student self-assessment.  We use MYON.com leveled ebook texts and assessments in our Entering classes; myON 
for Independent Reading that provides leveled text as well as bilingual texts; site words; sentence stems for oral and written 
communication; glossaries and dictionaries are provided in every class to every student with repeated lessons on how to use 
them; adapted texts are taught with an adherence to the CCLS and Regents assessments; use of graphic organizers that are 
used through the whole SLC and shared with ISS teachers that include the Frayer model for activating schema and building 
relationships; RACES method for writing (Restate the question/Answer the parts of the question/Cite/Explain/Summarize); 
MEAL paragraph structure strategies, lesson structure and stems for accountable talk and writing.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We ensure that students are given the most supportive program while adhering to IEP goals and ELL status based on their 
NYSESLAT scores.  This year we made sure ELL placement was checked through the SWD guidance counselor, Alexandra 
Pugliese; the ENL guidance counselor Marina Deletrain and the ENL Coordinator, Tara Lallbachan.  ELL-SWDs are given all ELL-
mandated accomodations on NYS regents exams in addition to those listed on their IEPs.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All students are programmed for 9 periods daily and Saturday intervention programs in all content subjects.  The additional 
classes are placed on all student programs, the classes require attendance by the student.  We offer targeted interventions for 
students regarding credit accumulation by placing them in Math, Social Studies, Science and ELA classes.  We follow up on 
those interventions by giving the students and teachers individualized supports based on the students’ needs and ENL 
level.  We programmed students for the Saturday Social programs in ELA and Science for those who need the Living 
Environment or Earth Science Regents and for all Entering and Emerging students who were not taking a credit bearing 
Saturday class.  We are using the EDAT to target our lon-term ELLs and ensure they are programed into these supplemental 
programs.  We are using the AMAO tracker as well as the Early Warning Indicators system facilitated by our CBO TDS to track 
and monitor out at-risk students who are struggling with attendance, academics and/or socio-emotionally.We will be using 
WitSi strategies to help bolster writing across content areas.  We will also be using the strategic inquiry portion to track the 
writing and instructional implications of twenty ELLs that range from Emerging to Expanding.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the success this year of the Small Learning Community model, we will continue to program as such.  We will be 
better implementing and to ensure better tracking and supporting of our ELLS.  We are looking towards adding a stronger 
language acquisition program for our Entering and Emerging students, through the implementation of strong digital literacy 
skills.  We will also be using elements of Kate Kinsella's Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, Literacy Design Collaborative and WTIsi 
to promote writing skills. We plan to establish a better ELL Buddy-Mentor system, in which we pair ELLs with non-ELLs, 
preferably of the same home language, and with similar general education SLC interests. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not discontinuing any programs at this time. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students at MVB have access to all school programs.  ELLs who are not in Saturday credited classes are enrolled in Saturday 
Social which is Title III funded and facilitated by ENL Coordinator, Tara Lallbachan.  They have language enrichment, science 
focused review, trips and computer skill building.  Students receive small-group instruction and after school wraparound 
services based on their academic needs.  We hold an International Festival that is largely supported by the ENL students; 
students are part of various clubs, teams and leadership activities.  Students also receive peer tutoring through our Scholars 
program.  All eligible ELLs are encouraged to participate in College Readiness programs including QCC Cluster classes, College 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          93 

 

Now, College Focus, and SAT prep classes.  We recruit in their ELA classes to ensure that all students receive proper 
notification.  To help recruitment and parent engagement we send messages through Pupilpath in translated languages 
specified by the parents.  Students who have an 85 and above average are recruited and invited to be Scholars or Leaders and 
have a designated official class code.  They serve as ambassadors for the school and participate in community service activities. 
On sport teams, students are recruited in their physical education classes, by teammates and by coaches.  Students are 
encouraged to see their guidance counselor if they are interested in an extracurricular activity.  In most sports, 10% of the 
team members are ELLs.  ELL participation has not been limited by language proficiency.           
   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ENL classrooms, for all levels, have SmartBoards and access to laptop carts.  The Entering ENL class has a dedicated 
classroom with a SmartBoard. They also utilize the myON.com program for leveled reading.  The dedicated Global/U.S. History 
classes have sets of Samsung tablets, iPads, Chromebooks and a SmartBoard.  The dedicated math teacher has a SmartBoard, 
as do the science and the U.S. History teachers.  All teachers have access to the computer rooms and their printers.  Teachers 
reserve the computer rooms in advance.  Both ELA teachers have SmartBoards and access to the Samsung tablets as well as 
laptop carts to aid in project based learning and sheltered instruction.  These materials are used for all levels.Students may use 
their phones and the tablets as translation resources.  Students have been using an app that translates worksheets.  Teachers 
are using this resource at varying levels based on the supports the student needs, as correlated with their ENL levels.  Every 
student in the building has a myON.com online leveled ebook account, and starting next year, will have a Zinc Learning Lab 
Academic Vocabulary online study account.  These programs will be used in all ENL classrooms, across levels.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 We only offer an ENL program.  We deliver all content in English and offer multiple paths to translate and acquire 
language.  Native language is used at the Emerging/Transitioning level to help build Tier I vocabulary and then to help 
understand content revealed in Tier II vocabulary.  Teachers utilize all translation methods to assist in delivering content and 
use buddy system grouping that involves two students with same language (when able) and a more proficient students to 
guide reciprocal teaching.  Questions on assessments and responses may be delivered in a student’s home language and 
exams may be given in translated form. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The ELL Coordinator, guidance counselor, AP, teachers, students and parents are all involved in ensuring that the students are 
receiving the services and resources they need.  We review our new students prior school transcripts to see where they belong 
based on their age and ENL level.  If needed, they are put into different grade cohorts if transcripts are missing and if they are 
Entering or Emerging.  Otherwise, they are placed in accordance to the Office of Enrollment.  We follow curriculum based on 
the grade levels they are placed in and offer scaffolded reading and writing based on each of the students’ needs.  Based on 
grade level, students are guided through the college readiness process and create goals that follow to meet their College and 
Career Readiness personalized goals.  We place our students based on their age, cohort, grade level and NYSESLAT or NYSITELL 
score and provide them with the BESIS minutes and supports regulated by Part 154.  The ELA and ENL classes are grade 
banded by contiguous grades for ELA and proficiency for ENL.     
         
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
No ENL classes are shared with a colocated school.  All ENL classrooms, for all levels, are exclusinve to Martin Van Buren High 
School and have SmartBoards and access to laptop carts.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
This year we had a Freshman Kickoff for our new students.  All ENL SLC teachers were present and facilitated this 
orientation.  In Entering/Emerging ENL classes, students are given orientations and guides for adapting to the new building. 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          94 

 

 

Teachers create buddies for our newcomers and have an adult connection with a teacher that they know they can go to with 
any questions. ENL Coordinator, Tara Lallbachan, gives an orientation to all Newcomers and their parents.   The ENL 
Coordinator and AP coordinates the events with the support of the SLC teachers and the guidance counselor.  We will contiue 
to do so in coming school years. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish and French   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The calendar for Professional Development is weekly with Tuesdays and Wednesdays being Professional Development that is 
led within the ENL SLC.  Tuesdays are spent in team meetings where teachers develop WitSi strategy content and lessons 
applying and adapting them, while meeting Common Core Standards.  Wednesdays are spent norming and conducting the 
inquiry process looking at student work on these strategies.  In the 2016-2017, departmental professional development time 
was held at the end of an abridged Thursday bell schedule.  Early shift teachers met from 1:50-2:50, and late shift from 2:40-
3:40pm within their departments to share further curricular updates and strategies.  The ELA/ENL meetings were conducted by 
the ELA/ENL AP, Brian Panepinto.  This year’s Instructional Focus was, and will continue to be, “If teachers monitor student 
progress to differentiate instruction and provide timely, actionable feedback to students, then students will be able to 
communicate evidence-based claims in writing across all disciplines.”  The goal is for teachers to have continual professional 
learning to support students in making evidence scaffolding and giving actionable feedback to improve cite/evidence based 
claims.  School-wide, the teachers have been using close read and annotation method that are in the ELA EngageNY modules, 
and WITSi to build capacity for all levels of student to improve their reading, citing evidence and discussion.  Our Professional 
Developments reference and focus on these goals.In the ENL SLC, teachers Tara Lallbachan (ENL), Madeline McNally (ENL), 
Danielle Vargas (ENL), Ana Recinos (ENL), Michael Rosenberg (SS), Declan Reidy (SS), Jocelyn Pinero (math), Helen Yoo (ELA), 
Michelle Turman (ELA), Neal Nachman (science), Marc Shoichet (SS), Marina Deletrain (guidance counselor), and Brian 
Panepinto (AP ENL & ELA), continuously have Professional learnings where research, student work, SIOP models, EngageNY, 
WITsi strategies, and use inquiry are reviewed and related our learning to our professional practice.  Teachers give 
presentations on what works in their classes and how we can improve our instruction and student capacity. Teacher who 
attend out of building professional learnings, return and turnkey the content to the entire SLC.  On many occasions, on 
Thursdays,  the ENL SLC conducts Early Warning Indicator Meetings, this is facilitated by TDS Community School 
Director.  Teachers practice using PRIM to create interventions for students who are exhibiting at-risk behaviors. All teachers, 
paraprofessionals, School Safety Agents, APs, psychologists, related service providers and secretaries are sent updates for 
working with ELLs and how to respond to a student with low proficiency outside of the classroom.During our DOE determined 
professional development days there are sessions that include ways to support ELLs, including best practices and how to 
ensure they are receiving their accommodations.  Ms. Deletrain, the ENL guidance counselor, along with grade level guidance 
counselors did push-ins into every department meeting in the month of October to review interventions and addressing the 
needs and progress of the ELLs.           All of the ENL SLC teachers have reviewed together in team meetings the ENL scaffolding

materials that are on EngageNY.  Teachers have adapted lessons to use in their own classrooms.We will continue to use WITsi 
with our ENL students to support the writing of the students and help them achieve writing proficiency on the NYSESLAT and 
Regents exams.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ENL teachers have created a monthly school-wide staff professional development calendar, where each ENL teacher will rotate 
and push into the building's four Small Learning Community's meetings, monthly, to deliver and turnkey various ENL centered 
pedagogy.  Topics will range from: Identifying and Grouping ELLs, Differentiation Strategies, Vocabulary (Academic/Content) 
Strategies and Learning Maps, and Enhancing Content and Language Objectives for ELLs.  These monthly, school-wide 
professional development meetings will comprise of 15% of the total hours necessary for all teachers in the building, per CR 
Part 154 regulations.  Minutes, attendance, and agendas for all ENL professional development meetings will be kept in the ENL 
office in Room 135.In the ENL SLC, teachers meet every Tuesday and Wednesday for professional development.  All teachers 
receive ELL support and best practices information, usually created by ENL teachers and supported by the AP, Brian 
Panepinto.  The ENL SLC and the ENL/ELA departments also meet weekly for ENL-specific professional learnings regarding 
utilizing WITSi strategies to respond in writing, improving comprehension in both reading and listening, and methods to deliver 
content and skills to our students. Teachers are leading discussions on ways embed grade-level reading comprehension, critical 
reading, and evidence-based writing skills into WIT lessons and activities 
         
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In previous years bi-yearly meetings were held inviting ELL parents to attend evening and Saturday meetings with all of their 
child's SLC ENL and Content Area teachers, to discuss their goals, language development progress, and assessment results-- 
apart from mandated parent-teacher conferences.  This year and next, the plan is to hold these meetings monthly, on Fridays, 
as "Coffee and Conversation with ELL Parents." In addition to their child's SLC ENL and Content Area teachers, parents will have 
the opportunity to meet AP ELA ELA Brian Panepinto, ELL Coordinator Tara Lallbachan, ENL Guidance Counselor Marina 
Deletrain, and Parent Coordinator Russell Chew.  Invitations for these meetings will be sent through pupilpath (translated for 
parents), backpack (with a return bottom), by phone and by mail.  We will also hold a Winter Open House for ELL parents in 
December and a Spring Open House in March, at which time all ELL parents will be invited again to meet with teachers from 
the ENL SLC.Retention of records of meetings, including phone calls, will be on Skedula.  We will also have a binder dedicated 
to the Part 154 meetings that will include letters, agendas and attendance.  The binder will located in the ENL office in Room 
135. 
     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 In the beginning of the school year, we have a welcome back celebration/orientation with our SLC ENLs.  Students, parents 
and family members are invited to celebrate the start of the school year.  It is during this celebration that all ENL teachers, as 
well as our teachers within our SLC come and socialize with parents and provide a setting that is welcoming and 
supportive.  We have found this to be very effective in supporting our parents with limited English proficiency. Also, this gives 
parents the  opportunity to meet other parents and share cultures through food and discussion. On September 30 there was a 
CBO/school based event for families where we held a Parent Capacity Building workshop for ELL families with translators. 
Letters are sent home to parents at the beginning of the school year.  Parents are provided with information that includes 
teacher contacts, school website and student PupilPath instructions.  In addition, Entitlement letters indicate the student’s 
continuation of services based on the most recent NYSELAT scores.  Individual teachers send out classroom

contracts.  Indicated on the contracts are class requirements, student responsibilities and a general syllabus.  Students as well 
as parents are required to sign the contracts and return them to the individual teachers for retention. Teachers use translated 
letters via Pupilpath and translators to communicate with parents.   
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Through our Small Learning Communities, our Expanding students are able to take career and college readiness electives such as 
Model United Nations, Engineering, Robotics, or medical classes. We look forward to rejoining LEAD (Learning English through Arts 
and Drama) from Lincoln Center through an Arts grant in the coming school years.  This allows for Lincoln Theatre teaching artists 
to coteach 10 sessions in an ENL class for artists to help students write a script for a class-read text and enhance their 
speaking/performance skills as they put on final theaterical performances for parents and other students.This year, we created a 
Girls who Code program for our ELLs to learn 21st century skills such as coding.

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon admittance, the students are interviewed by Mrs. McNally the LAC Coordinator. With the Coordinator, all 
questions on the Home Language Survey are reviewed, and an oral interview process begins. Once a home 
language other than English is noted, the intake process continues with the student being tested by the NYSITELL. 
After the results, data is updated on the ELPC screen, and BESIS. Data includes parent survey information and 
language preference for school information.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
