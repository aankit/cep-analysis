Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of P53K is to challenge students to achieve their personal best and empower them to become productive, 
independent members of society. Our collaborative disciplinary team provides a standard-based curriculum utilizing 
real life experiences embedded in data driven instruction. We, the staff of P53K, commit to partnering with parents 
and community members to maximize each student’s potential. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P53K is a multi-sited school composed of eight sites, providing instruction to both standardized and alternately 
assessed students in the 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1, and 12:1:4 ratios, as well as inclusion programs, from kindergarten to 
students turning 21. P53K has community-based partnerships with the following organizations: Disney Musicals In 
Schools, Shubert Organization, Cookshop, Lincoln Center, Yale Center for Puppetry, Marquis Studios, Learning through 
an Expanded Arts Program (LeAp), Everyday Arts in Special Education (EASE), Get Ready of Learn (GRTL), Urban 
Advantage, “Plant, Learn, Grow,” and GreenThumb. Additionally we have students going out to the community for 
work-based programs at locations including TJ MAXX, GAP, Five Below, P53K Community Garden, Burlington Coat 
Factory, Security Department and Building Maintenance as well as the Cafeteria at Kingsborough Community College, 
and Modell’s Sporting Goods. This year, P53K school and students have been awarded Disability Pride Logo Contest 
Winner, Marquis D75 Calendar, Budding Botanist Grant, CASA Arts Grant, Brooklyn Borough Arts Festival, RESO A 
grants, and the District 75 Summer Camp Scholarship. We are also thrilled that two of our inclusion students are 
transitioning into college. 

This past year, P53K continued to work towards ensuring that we are providing students with rigorous instruction, 
fostering supportive environments, creating a culture of teacher collaboration, nurturing effective school leadership, 
and establishing strong family-community ties. We have done this through school based coaching support, teacher 
leadership development through participation in the P53K Teacher Leadership Program (TLP), as well as classroom 
inter-visitations and creating six half-days of professional development for all staff with approval of the Chancellor’s 
Office. 

  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

 

Level 3, Students Age 18 - 21: This student population requires a least restrictive environment to meet their 
interests and needs in secondary education such as College Inclusion. 

  12:1:4 students: The students in this population require meaningful curriculum and differentiated 

assessments to meet their needs. Therefore, a district 12:1:4 cohort where best practices are shared is 
beneficial. 

  6:1:1 students with more severe needs: A group of students at the early elementary level with autism need a 

 

verbal behavior approach in the classroom. 
Level 3, 12:1:1 elementary students across grades: This group of students need more rigorous instruction on 
literacy. 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Framework for Great Schools – P53K 2017-2018 Progress in Framework Elements: 

● Rigorous instruction: Increased writing performance for students across all grade bands and levels of learners. 

● Supportive environment: During the 2017 - 2018 school year. School based trainers conducted two sessions of 
Therapeutic Crisis Intervention based training. Twenty additional staff members were trained in the Core Curriculum 
(Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools) and an additional seventeen staff members were trained in the extension 
course for students with Developmental Disabilities. Staff hired within the last year were targeted for Core Curriculum 
training. Staff members that have passed the core course were identified for the extension. Both cohorts included 
paraprofessionals, teachers and related service providers.  

● Teacher collaboration: Developed a culture of teacher collaboration to address instructional challenges through a 
problem of practice protocol. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

● Effective School Leadership: Increased participation in SEM (Schoolwide Enrichment Model) cluster facilitated by 
paraprofessionals, related service providers, and teachers. 

 

● Strong Family-Community Ties: Offered monthly Cookshop for Families workshops across all sites. 

P53K key areas of focus for 2018-2019 are to: 

1. (Rigorous Instruction) To increase academic rigor through improvement of writing skills with more explicit writing 
instruction. 

2. (Supportive Environment) To Increase staff members' capacity to effectively design supportive environments and 
effective interventions for P53K student populations through continued training opportunities in Therapeutic Crisis 
Intervention for Schools Core and extension courses for Students with Developmental Disabilities as well as through 
expanding social emotional learning opportunities within our existing school wide Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports framework.  

3. (Teacher Collaboration) To further develop a culture of teacher collaboration to address instructional challenges 
identified through shared data analysis during pupil personnel team meetings focused on IEP development. 

4. (Effective School Leadership) To increase capacity to share best practices among all staff by empowering support 
staff to provide professional development to all stakeholders 

5. (Strong Family-Community Ties) To strengthen social skills and personal behavior skills of students through site 
wide events and attendance at other partnership community events.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

During the 2017-2018 school year, P53K identified the instructional focus to be “A school-wide effort to have all P53K 
students to produce four published piece of writing in one school year through daily writing opportunities across all 
content areas as measured by end-of-unit culminating projects and growth in SANDI writing skills” 

 

Aligned to this instructional focus, the teachers administered benchmark assessments aligned to SANDI writing 
assessment and the essential elements as documented by the Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM). The assessment was 
given in September to collect a baseline data point and then assessed every 6-8 weeks after each unit of study. 
Results indicate that by the end of the year, students across all grade bands and learning levels made progress on 
their benchmark skills.

*Note: There are only two levels in writing benchmark assessments: Emergent and Conventional 

This year, in addition to our focus on writing, our units of study were strengthened with a more direct alignment with 
the DLM Essential Elements. The focused skills for each unit across all grade bands were aligned to the DLM Essential 
Elements of the appropriate grade levels and learning levels (i.e., initial precursor, distal precursor, proximal 
precursor, target, successor). Teachers at each site met twice weekly in their Professional Learning Communities (PLC) 
to discuss and share best instructional practices and planned for the four unit plans for ELA, Math, Social Studies, and 
Science under the guidance of instructional coaches. 

 

Although we made made progress in improving writing performance, P53K’s priority need for 2018-2019 is to 
continue with a focus on writing instruction. This need is evidenced by: 

  Benchmark Assessment - As the data above shows, as compared to reading and math, writing made the least 

progress. 

  Culminating Demonstrations – At the end of each unit of study, each class held a publishing party. During this 

event, each student or a small group of student shared their published piece of writing across all disciplines 
with their class. Although writing was demonstrated by the students, it was evident that some students were 
not progressing on the writing continuum appropriately. 

  Teacher feedback - According to year-end teacher survey, teachers enjoyed the writing focus this year but felt 

that they needed more professional development in how to teach writing for our learners. 

  Teacher observation - Very few classrooms had explicit writing instruction and a period dedicated to teaching 

writing. Much of the writing was embedded into an ELA, Math, Science and/or Social Studies period. In ELA, 
the writing was generally writing in response to a text and/or question. 

Therefore, our instructional focus for 2018-2019 is “A school-wide effort to have all P53K students produce four 
published expressive writing pieces in one school year during a dedicated instructional writing period supported by 
explicit instruction for students and professional development for staff, focused on the writing process as evidenced 
by student self-assessment of the end-of-unit culminating published writing pieces and growth in benchmark writing 
skills." 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be at least a 10% increase in writing performance as measured by a comparative analysis of 
benchmark assessments administered between September 2018 and June 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

P53K has continually worked to improve school safety and climate through the implementation of a therapeutic 
approach to supporting student behavior through training for staff in Cornell’s Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for 
Schools (TCIS) curriculum. Currently, P53K has four trainers on staff that allow us to train at least 20 - 40 staff 
members per year. This past school year we have continued our trend of holding one core cohort of 20 staff member 
as well as one cohort of 20 staff trained in the aligned extension course Therapeutic Crisis intervention for Students 
with Developmental Disabilities. Participants for both cohorts were identified based on need. All staff members 
selected for TCIS Core Training were hired within the last year and all staff participating in the extension course had 
passed the Core Training in the last two years. As part of P53K's participation in the Collaborative Schools Initiative 
this year's cohorts also included staff members from our partner community schools that were identified as needing 
training. Three paraprofessionals from PS130 took the Core Training along side P53K staff. All school based trainers 
are able to train both courses and actively participated in both trainings.  

 

Historically, this increase in trained staff coincided with a 3-year trend decrease in the number of level 4 and 5 
incidents, the number of students involved in multiple incidents and the average number of incidents per student 
recorded in OORS. During the 2017 -2018 school year we saw a slight increase in the number of 4 and 5 incidents 
reported early in the year (5 total in October and 4 in November). Further analysis reveals, however, that we we still 
are maintaining a decrease in the number of students involved in multiple incidents (2) and the average number per 
student.  

 

P53K's belief is that there is a direct connection with the downward trend in OORS reported incidents across the 
board and the development of staff skills in approaching challenging student behaviors through the implementation 
of skills learned in TCIS and the related extension course for students with developmental disabilities. Our data from 
this year additionally reveals the need to review and strengthen our existing Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports framework to include more opportunities for learning pro social behaviors across the year. To this end our 
school wide PBIS team will work to expand to all sites and grow staff understanding of behavioral needs and social 
emotional learning.

P53K has worked continuously over the past five years to develop and promote opportunities for teachers to work 
together to address instructional needs and support each others' professional development: 

 

  This year, across all sites, teachers were members of professional learning communities that met two times 
per week. In addition, teachers met collaboratively a minimum of two additional periods per week for any of 
the following reasons: instructional practices, curriculum development, Problem of Practice protocol, IEP 
development, Functional Behavioral Assessment/Behavior Intervention Plan Progress Monitoring.  

  This year, we also scheduled in at least one meeting a week for a collaborative meeting that involved related 

service providers. 

  During the last quarter of 2017-2018 school year, across all sites, all classroom teachers were given the 

 

opportunity to write the unit plans for 2018-2019. They met weekly for 3 hours supported by the 
Administration and Instructional Coaches. Teams worked to ensure curricular and instructional cohesiveness 
across classrooms and sites as well as alignment to the DLM Essential Elements. 
For the past three years, in order to continue to further develop teacher leaders across the organization, the 
school utilized the school based team of Teacher Leaders to continue to organize and support collaborative 
teacher meetings. This year Teacher Leaders planned and led Problem of Practice meetings at their individual 
sites. The focus of these meetings was to create a forum for teachers to discuss instructional challenges 
through the lens of the Danielson Cluster Framework. The objective is not to solve the dilemma but to open 
more doors to possible solutions or ways to consider the dilemma. Each month, teacher leaders met with 
their site cohort group and identified an instructional challenge for review. Using the Consultancy Protocol, 
teacher teams collaborated to identify possible strategies to address the identified instructional challenge. 
The feedback regarding this process from teachers was very positive. 

  According to teacher generated agenda items, a common thread amongst all sites was identified. Teachers 

indicated the need for additional support in the area of IEP development, managing data from 
multidisciplinary teams and utilizing data to identify student areas of needs and growth.  

To further develop a culture of teacher collaboration and to address the above needs, our goal for 2018-2019 is to 
improve the effectiveness of Pupil Personnel Team meetings with a focus on IEP development.

P53K continuously supports the professional growth of its staff. It is the norm for staff to seek out professional 
development and requested workshops are often approved by the principal. Many staff members (including 
paraprofessionals) have attended workshops provided by the district such as: Structured Methods in Language 
Education (SMILE), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools (TCIS), Get Ready 
to Learn (GRTL), Birch Institute, Association for School Curricula Development (ASCD), Leaders in Education 
Apprenticeship Program ( LEAP), Transition, Inter-school Development with P373K, various speech, occupational, and 
physical therapy-related workshops, Teaching Core Vocabulary, Teachers College, D75 curriculum writing, and 
curriculum overviews (Unique, Attainment, Equals, Essentials for Living). We have had coaches from the district come 
to support our staff in transitional services, technology, STEM, and strategies for students with autism, as well as, the 
roll-out of Wilson Reading Programs with MSQI central coaches. 

 

This year, P53K has again set aside six half-days in addition to the Chancellor’s Conference days for additional staff 
professional development. These half-days are mostly led by our own staff to share best practices and turn-key 
workshops they have attended. Some of these workshops include using assistive technology, sensory strategies, 
behavioral data collection, GRTL, transition services, using a SmartBoard, IEP writing, and using Boardmaker. On 
Anniversary Day, our entire related service staff led workshops to turn-key the instructional, social and behavior 
strategies they have learned through the various workshops they have attended throughout the year. 

 

In 2017-2018, P53K strengthened our SEM initiative by reducing our training period to 4 weeks and extending our 
implementation period to 14 weeks. The training was led by individuals who attended the Confratute Seminar at 
University of Connecticut (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented). Teachers, related service 
providers and a handful of paraprofessionals facilitated weekly 1-1.5 hour SEM periods with small groups of students. 
At the end of the 10 week implementation, their projects were presented at our P53K SEM Fair in May 2018. 
Additionally our efforts this year were recognized by The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented and 
our staff was asked to present our work at the annual national professional learning Conference "Confratute".  

 

P53K’s priority need for 2018-2019 is to increase the opportunities for related service providers to turnkey specialized 
training they hold. Based on the workshop evaluation for Anniversary Day, teachers and paraprofessionals found the

In 2017-2018, there were many opportunities for parent involvement in the school community. Parents were invited 
to every end-of-unit culminating event to see the progress of their child's academic and functional skills. They were 
also invited to attend monthly Family Days that included SLT meetings, Parent Trainings and PA events. They received 
monthly newsletters informing them all P53K events from the parent coordinator. Our Parent Coordinator had even 
more parents sign up for the app REMIND. This was an effective communicative tool to inform parents of school 
events and needs. We coordinated trips for our P53K families to attend such as the American Museum of Natural 
History, Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, NY Aquarium and The Queens Museum of Science. There were also opportunities 
unique to District 75 such as movie trips, District 75 Family Fun Day, Carnival Event, Picture Exchange Communication 
System (PECS) Workshop, and the Disability Parade . We also conducted monthly workshops including CookShop for 
Families, OPWDD Front Door Training, Guardianship, and Transition Fairs. In the beginning of the year, parents were 
invited in for a Curriculum Meet and Greet to be exposed to what the children will be learning and meet all staff that 
will be working with their children. Throughout the school year, we also hosted Medicaid Service Coordinator 
Workshops, Behavior Strategies Workshop led by the School Counselors, Related Services Workshop to discuss 
various techniques for parents to try at home, and a School-wide Enrichment Model Fair. In addition, parents were 
invited to attend the second year of Disney Musicals in Schools show, "Aladdin," and our Shubert Foundation 
Culminating performance of "Annie". Parents attended the show for multiple performances throughout the week.  

 

Therefore, our priority need for 2018-2019 is to increase our community relations through more opportunities for 
parents.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 53K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P53K will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

P53K has established an instructional program that addresses the academic, language, and 
physical needs of English Language Learners (ELLs) with disabilities in grades K – 12.  There 
are 472 students, of which 101 are English Language Learners. The ELLs make up 21% of the 
student population.   
 Students receive ENL instruction either in an integrated  or stand alone model from a certified 
English as a New Language (ENL) teacher during the school day.  Students whose IEP 
recommends bilingual services but for whom no bilingual class is available receive support in 
their native language from an alternate placement paraprofessional in accordance with CR Part 
154 mandates at the same time that they receive ENL from a licensed ENL teacher. Instruction is 
driven by the (CCLS) Common Core Learning Standards and New Language Arts Progressions 
as well as IEP and core curriculum. The NYSESLAT is administered every year to all ELL 
students regardless of their disability. Instruction is delivered via one or more of the following 
ENL strategies: TPR (Total Physical Response),(LEA) Language Experience Approach, SIOP 
(Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol), CALLA (Cognitive Academic Language Learning 
Approach), scaffolding, thematic and cooperative instruction.   
The supplemental instructional support will be provided for twelve (12) ELL alternate 
assessment students with an IEP designation of (12:1:1) One (1) student is in ninth grade, two (2) 
students are in tenth grade, two (2) students are in eleventh grade, and seven (7) students are in 
twelfth grade.  All students scored at the entering lor emerging level on the 2018 NYSESLAT 
assessment. All are long term ELLS with more than 7 years of ENL services.  Data collected and 
analyzed indicate that due to similar student needs and abilities, additional support should 
improve their academic achievement and English language acquisition. Most students are either 
at emergent or early reading levels and have shown progress in reading and writing in 
English. Instruction will be provided in English by one (1)certified ENL teacher with additional 
Spanish language support from two (2) paraprofessionals.  The Title III after school program will 
occur on selected Mondays and Tuesdays  from 2:55-4:55 p.m. for  fifteen (15) weeks from 
November to February. There will be thirty (30) two hour instructional sessions and six (6) one 
hour professional development sessions.   
 
Students will participate in a multicultural dance, food,art and music festival after reading 
literature representative of different cultures. Students will complete various response to 
literature activities on chosen multicultural folktales which can include any of the following: a 
storyboard, a poster, dress up as a character and act out a scene from the book, prepare a game, 
create a poem, song or dance.  The whole group will participate in the final multicultural dance 
and food festival which will include art, food and dance from the countries studied. Supplies 
purchased include a set of multicultural folktales which will be read during the sessions.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Standards addressed during the program are as follows: Technology Standard 5 - (Students will 
apply technological knowledge and skills to design, use, and evaluate products and systems to 
satisfy human and environmental needs.) is addressed throughout the program as students use the 
smart board, computers, e-books and I-pads, to research the literature, art and culture of different 
countries. Art Standard 1 – (Students will actively engage in the processes that constitute 
creation and performance in the arts: dance, music, theatre, and visual arts and participate in 
various roles in the arts) is addressed because the students will perform dances and create art 
representing the different cultures studied. Common Core Speaking and Listening Standard 4 - 
Report on a topic or text or present an opinion, sequencing ideas logically and using appropriate 
facts and relevant, descriptive details to support main ideas and themes; speak clearly at an 
understandable pace.  Common Core Writing Standard 1- Write arguments to support claims 
with clear reasons and relevant evidence. Common Core Reading Standard 1 - Cite textual 
evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the 
text.  The appropriate New Language Arts Progressions which apply to the aforementioned 
common core standards will also be addressed. 
Instruction will be delivered in a whole group setting for the beginning of each lesson then the 
teacher and paraprofessionals will work with an assigned group of 3 to 4 students and will serve 
mainly as facilitators and technology support as students work on their assigned projects. English 
will be the dominant language spoken with Spanish support being provided by the Spanish 
bilingual paraprofessionals. The LEAP Art program will provide dance instruction during seven 
(7) student workshops titled "Dancing Around the World."

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 Formative assessments used for our alternate assessment special needs ELL students include the SANDI/FAST (Student Annual 
Needs Determination Inventory/Formative Assessments of Standards Tasks). The SANDI/FAST is especially designed for special 
needs students with cognitive disabilities and provides a formal qualitative and quantitative assessment of the students’ level 
in reading and math. Data gleamed from the SANDI is used to write student IEP (Individual Education Plan)goals. Other formal 
assessments include Wilson Reading Program assessments, and SMILE (Structured Methods in Literacy Education) initial 
screening and post screening checklists of sounds and words. Teacher made assessments used daily or weekly to check for 
understanding during instruction include the use of KWL charts, peer to peer interactions like think- pair-share, daily writing 
tasks including journal entries or reports, vocabulary word and phonics games, word bingo, and oral retelling and summarizing 
of material read and running records. These formative assessments provide information needed to adjust teaching and 
learning while they are happening and guide future instruction.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers have weekly grade level PLC (Professional Learning Community) meetings. Student academic needs are discussed and 
ideas shared after reviewing assessments and work samples. Teachers are provided with time and support in completing 
assessments. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments include rubrics, progress reports, benchmark data collection sheets, leveled benchmark skill charts, 
unit presentations, the progress made on annual IEP goals  and the (WRAP) Writing Reading Assessment Profile which includes 
running records, retelling, comprehension prompts and word checklists to determine reading level and literacy needs of 
students. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 Instruction is differentiated to address the specific academic needs of each student as determined by the aforementioned 
assessments and IEP goals are modified or changed accordingly. Special needs students are placed in small classroom settings 
(6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:4 or 12:1:1) where individual instruction can occur and individual student academic needs can be met. 
Special education classes are geared for individual learning and students are provided with the language and academic support 
that is needed for the cognitively delayed student to progress. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 During the weekly PLC meetings teachers determine what skills need to be addressed as a result of data gathered. Instruction 
is differentiated and adapted to meet the needs of ELL students in Tier 1 instruction. These skills are then integrated into 
students’ IEP goals for the year. A curriculum is developed which allows ELL students to fully participate in Tier 1 core 
instruction while targeting these skills. ELL students are given extra attention and scaffolds to aid them. Small group 
instruction or intensive individualized instruction as indicated in the Rtl framework, is provided during both stand alone and 
integrated ENL sessions for those students who have been designated as Tier 2 or 3. Many of our special needs students fall 
into this category because they function below their age appropriate grade level. ELL students prior knowledge and 
background is considered when designing curriculum as indicated in the Rtl framework. ELLs engage in classroom discussions 
during cooperative group work to aid in developing English speaking and listening skills. This is a key component in the Rtl 
guide to instruction. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
All ELL students take the NYSESLAT though they are alternate assessment students. Most of our special education students 
score at the beginning level on standardized tests due to cognitive delays and physical disabilities.  The scores on the NYSITEL 
and NYSESLAT do not adequately reflect students' progress because it measures progress according to the grade level of 
general education students and 90% of our students are alternate assessment.  SANDI (Student Annual Needs Determination 
Inventory), NYSAA (New York State Alternate Assessment), student work portfolios and other informal assessments provide a 
more accurate measure of English language proficiency and are used to evaluate and inform our ENL program. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During PLC meetings or staff professional development days, the ENL teachers meet with classroom teachers to discuss ways 
to address student academic and language needs after reviewing assessment data. Teachers including the ENL teacher meet 
prior to the annual IEP meeting to review and address student needs and progress and to discuss IEP goals and issues that 
would be pertinent to parents.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ELL students are designated 12:1:1, 12:1:4, 8:1:1, 6:1:1 or inclusion according to the IEP recommendations.  Students 
with similar language needs and same IEP designation are placed in the same class. The proficiency levels are mixed 
within the classes.  Students are pulled out of their class for the stand alone session or the ENL teacher pushes in and 
delivers instruction in collaboration with the classroom teacher to fulfill the required minutes of integrated ENL.  The 
pull out stand alone ENL students are grouped according to academic and proficiency level.  The groups are within 
three contiguous grade levels. The languages of the groups are mixed. There is no bilingual alternate placement 
program. Students mandated for bilingual instruction receive ENL instruction plus the services of an alternate 
placement paraprofessional who is fluent in the student's native language and in English. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All of our special needs ELLs who are designated as ENL or bilingual in grades K-12 receive the required weekly minutes of ENL 
from a certified ENL teacher in either a stand alone or integrated model as per the new CR Part 154 guidelines in collaboration 
with the classroom teacher during the integrated ENL sessions where possible. Currently there is no bilingual program. 
Students mandated for bilingual instruction, for whom the school cannot provide such instruction, receive ENL instruction plus 
the services of an alternate placement paraprofessional who is fluent in the student's native language and in English. P53K has 
eight sites and the ENL teachers travel to different sites which makes it difficult to ensure that all students receive the 
mandated minutes of both stand alone and integrated sessions. Every attempt will be made to provide the students with the 
mandated minutes as required. The ENL teachers create their schedule and determine the best time to pull students for the 
stand alone sessions and best time for the push in sessions after consulting the schedules of the classroom teachers.  Related 
service providers and the ENL teachers often work collaboratively in implementing language and literacy components which 
complement the unit the classroom teacher is working on at the time.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ENL program content area instruction including ELA, science, social studies and math is adapted to make content 
comprehensible to non-verbal alternate assessment special needs students in our 6:1:1 and 12:1:4 groups by utilizing 
augmentative communication devices and various types of multisensory materials including: Mayor Johnson picture symbols, 
i-pads and adapted books. ENL teachers use a combination of strategies to deliver instruction to these non-verbal students. 
TPR (Total Physical Response) is especially effective for this group of students; (students are asked to pass the ball to another 
student, pick up the pencil, walk to the door, etc).  Music, chants, and dance are all especially engaging for these students and 
may be used during the stand alone sessions to reinforce English language skills as well as in the integrated sessions to teach 
content area material. All content areas are covered in the integrated ENL program. Dance might be used to demonstrate the 
different types of weather or singing a song like the number rock  serve as excellent tools to teach math and science as well as 
reading skills covered in the Common Core Learning Standards.  English is used during the ENL stand alone and integrated 
sessions with native language support provided by the alternate placement paraprofessional. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

Strategies used to deliver instruction to  higher functioning 12:1:1 students include Cognitive Academic Language Learning 
Approach (CALLA),  the Language Experience Approach (LEA) and scaffolding (i.e. graphic organizers, word banks, and story 
maps). Phonics, cooperative learning, and balanced literacy are also incorporated into ENL instruction for these 12:1:1 
students in the stand alone and integrated sessions. 
 
Cooperative learning, thematic instruction, multisensory and multimedia materials also enhance the ENL program.  The Arts 
are incorporated throughout the content areas. ELLs are involved in all school projects like our annual multimedia fair and 
musical productions. Theme related activities combine content area instruction with literacy, technology, and oral-visual self-
expression. This supports and addresses English language acquisition through speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  All 
these scaffolds serve to assist ENL students in comprehending content area material and in acquiring the skills covered in the 
Common Core Learning Standards. 
 
All instruction is delivered in English with native language support provided by an alternate placement paraprofessional. The 
ENL teachers provide added support and scaffolding to content area instruction and thematic units that are occurring in the 
classroom during the integrated ENL sessions.  The New Language Arts Progressions and CCLS (Common Core Learning 
Standards) are all addressed through content area instruction during these sessions.  Native language support is provided in 
the ENL program by peer tutors.  Students in the stand alone ENL groups work cooperatively.  A more proficient student may 
be teamed with one who is less proficient to provide added English and native language support.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

An accurate reflection of students' native language proficiency can be gleaned from the results of informal assessments 
administered in collaboration with the alternate placement paraprofessional.  These include writing samples, word checklists, 
and accuracy in reading native language material in different content areas. 
 
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We provide the following interventions for SIFE students along with mandated ENL services: peer tutoring, a strong parent 
school connection and a culturally rich school environment.  The SMILE (Structured Methods In Language Education), Reading 
Recovery, Open Court, and the Wilson Fundations Reading Program are used to increase decoding and comprehension skills.  
 
Services that are available to newcomers include tutoring buddies and the development of initial literacy in native language 
that utilizes consistent ENL interventions and strategies. To make newcomers feel supported and comfortable, lessons related 
to their native culture are taught during the ENL session or during class time. Multicultural days are set aside during the year 
which provide teachers and students the opportunity to dress in their native country attire and share food and music from 
their culture. Topics specifically geared to newcomers during ENL, after school or during class instruction include the 
following:  literature, food, music and customs of the various countries represented in the school.  
 
Developing ELLS are taught thematically and lessons complement the classroom content instruction. Math, science, social 
studies and literature are all used to access the Common Core Standards and New Language Arts Progressions.  These subjects 
are taught through thematic units and content is contextualized to make it easily accessible to the ELL student by creating 
units that relate to their life experiences during ENL sessions which occur collaboratively with the classroom teacher or during 
the stand alone ENL session. Vocabulary, phonics, comprehension and writing skills are emphasized and students are assessed 
weekly on content and vocabulary learned.  Books and materials are adapted to meet the needs of special needs students. The 
use of communication boards and devices are also available for these students. Computer software and the i-pad are used to 
supplement content learning. Games and science experiments are utilized to provide hands-on learning for kinesthetic 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

learners.  Music, poems and chants are engaging ways to teach phonics, math, social studies and science.  They are also used 
to provide enrichment for the kinesthetic and auditory ELL learners.  
 
Long term ELLs continue in the program until they pass the NYSESLAT.  Interventions for long term ELLs include the following: 
peer tutoring, intensive phonics, comprehension and literacy skills instruction. Content area instruction is taught using 
sheltered instruction and scaffolding techniques with visuals and realia incorporated into all lessons.  Adaptive communication 
devices, communication books, adapted books, and picture symbols are accessible to our special needs non-verbal students. 
Also essential are multisensory materials and computer software, which increases student engagement during the 
instructional process.  Students are assessed regularly using the SANDI (Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory), 
WRAP (Writing Reading Assessment Profile), unit, benchmark and teacher made assessments.  Data gleaned from these 
assessment tools assist teachers in appropriate grouping for differentiated instructional lessons.  Extremely important for our 
ELL student is to provide supportive, multicultural experiences that promote a positive and nurturing learning environment. 
 
Former ELLs will receive a half unit of ENL services a week for up to two years to allow for a smooth transition into the ELA 
program. Progress is monitored informally by reviewing student work including writing samples, unit tests, comprehension and 
vocabulary word checklists and formal asssesments like the NYSAA. 
 
All the aforementioned occurs during 45 minute ENL stand alone or integrated ENL sessions as well as throughout the day in 
the classroom and across all subject areas by two certified ENL teachers and certified special education classroom teachers. 
Instruction is delivered in English with native language support provided by alternate placement paraprofessionals. The ENL 
teachers follow the school wide unit plans and reinforce the instruction happening in the classroom. Classroom teachers and 
ENL teachers work collaboratively in delivering instruction during the integrated ENL sessions and attend weekly planning 
meetings with literacy coaches in differentiating instruction for ELLs in each subgroup. ENL teachers and classroom teachers 
discuss the progress and needs of the ELL students and review IEP goals prior to meeting with the parent(s) for the annual 
IEP meeting. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Instructional strategies for ELLs with special needs are all those aforementioned, as all our students in P53K are special needs 
students. Grade level materials are adapted to meet the needs of students whose cognitive development is below their same 
age peers. All units of study are designed according to  general ed standards and skills but at a reduced depth and breadth 
according to results on the NYSAA (New York State Alternate Assessment).  The Unique, S.M.I.L.E (Structured Methods in 
Language Education) and “Sounds in Motion” curriculum are all especially designed for students with special needs including 
our ELLs to teach phonics and literacy.  All offer a mutlisensory approach to learning language.  These programs address grade 
level skills and standards in such a way as to make it accessible to students who function below their age appropriate grade 
level.  All lessons are leveled and differentiated to accommodate the different learning styles and cognitive abilities. Strategies 
incorporated into these programs include movement, chanting, and TPR.  Color and pictures reinforce sound letter and 
phonemic awareness. TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Related Handicapped Children), 
JARS(Joint Action Routines) and the "Give Me Twenty" programs are all incorporated in the 12:1:4 and 6:1:1 classrooms. The 
area of focus this year was on peer to peer interaction. Communication between students was included in lessons throughout 
the day. Students interviewed each other and shared experiences during student enrichment clusters. This served to promote 
English language acquisition and allowed the special needs student the opportunity to practice social skills. Classrooms are 
structured to emphasize routine and repetition which research has  shown benefits the special needs child including those 
with autism. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All students in P53K are special needs students so the environment is more restrictive than that of special education students 
in the community schools.  However our students are housed within sites located in community schools.  Students have the 
opportunity to participate in school wide events with their general education counterparts.  Some of our more independent 
students are placed in inclusion classes with general education students for most of the day.  Students from the community 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

school participate in an art program with our special needs students at our middle school site.  Both our special needs students 
and the general education students seem to greatly benefit from their interactions with one another.  All of our special needs 
students at the high school and middle school level are departmentalized.  They  travel from class to class for different subject 
areas. This gives them a sense of independence and allows them to experience other teachers and classrooms.  Also many of 
our high school students participate in the work study program. They work in stores in the community. Students acquire a 
sense of responsibility and pride in working and getting paid. They are away from the school setting and must learn to deal 
with situations independently.  
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The following programs are used for intervention in ELA for our long term and developing ELLs: The Unique Curriculum, Open 
Court Phonics Program, Wright Skills Reading and Phonics, reading recovery, SMILE curriculum, Wilson Reading Program and 
Boardmaker computer software. All of these programs are especially suited for our special needs ELLs because they provide a 
structured, visual and kinesthetic approach to learning literacy skills.  The different learning styles of the special needs students 
are addressed through these programs which research has demonstrated to be key in successfully engaging these students. 
During the after school program students use the myOn and Mindplay computer programs to aid in reading comprehension. 
The programs provide metrics to monitor reading activity and one on one sessions with a reading specialist.  
 
In the area of mathematics, we utilize the following interventions:  Equals Math Program, math related literature, math games 
and real life experiences.  Money skills, graphing, and basic adding and subtracting are all taught through a real life 
approach.  Students walk to the local market to shop and students work in the school store and take money from customers 
and return change. Computer programs addressing various math skills are also used.  Math skills are incorporated in all subject 
areas and math literature is used to reinforce these skills. 
 
Social Studies and Science lessons are also presented using the same hands-on approach. 
The Unique Curriculum addresses Social Studies and Science skills as well as ELA.  Each unit is thematically based and includes 
lessons in all content areas. The program provides follow up activities which are differentiated to reflect the different reading 
and cognitive levels. Visuals and realia are always available to address the various learning styles of students. Science 
standards are accessed through science experiments or visits to various places like parks, gardens or the farm to observe 
nature in person. Trips to the aquarium and museum are examples of some trips students have participated in, which covered 
many social studies standards.  
 
Instruction is delivered in English with native language support offered by alternate placement paraprofessionals. 
 
Some interventions we use for our newcomer ELLs are: tutoring with language support provided by native speaking peers or 
alternate placement paraprofessionals, development of native language skills which transfer over to English provided by ENL 
and alternate placement paraprofessionals, lessons related to their native culture and country, availability of native language 
literature, the choice to complete certain assignments in their native language, and cooperative learning, (students work in a 
team with other native language speakers and English speakers) in order to develop oral language skills in both English and 
their native language. 
 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our school received a grant from the Disney foundation. Students participated in a production of Lion King with the aid of 
professional dancers and teachers from Disney. Students performed in front of the school and were fortunate to perform to a 
group of students at a theatre on Broadway. The program will continue for the next two years. Our instructional focus for the 
upcoming school year will be on writing. P53K will be introducing a college inclusion program next year. High school students 
will attend college level courses adapted for the special ed student. Another program which will continue next year is 
Cookshop. Students and parents were taught how to prepare healthy meals with food provided by the NYC Food Bank.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not have a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs participate in all school wide activities and programs including the multimedia fair, school assemblies, trips, and 
theatrical and musical productions.  Many of our ELL students play on our basketball, volleyball, rowing, and baseball 
teams.  Also some ELL students went on our annual ski trip. The Title III after school program has been in place for several 
years now and has been highly beneficial in providing enrichment and added language and academic support to ELLs. Also ELLs 
participate in the CHAMPS sports after school program.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instruction materials used to support our ELLs in 12:1:4 and 6:1:1 classes include: augmentative communication devices and 
various types of multisensory materials including Mayor Johnson picture symbols and adapted books.  The Smart Board and I-
Pad are used and are especially helpful for these lower functioning students because it can be touched and does not require a 
mouse.  The large screen makes it accessible to visually challenged students and can be viewed by the whole group.  CDs, 
DVDs, and big books as well as tactile and sensory materials are also used.  Unifix cubes, play money, alphabet blocks. puzzles, 
balls, and food all enhance ENL lessons for this subgroup. Math materials include number cubes, flannel boards, scales, pattern 
blocks, money kits, puzzles, counting rods, beads, tactile counting books, and smartboard.  Social studies materials include 
Lakeshore theme boxes with flashcards and objects, photo libraries, magazines, bingo games on different themes like 
community helpers, big books and board games.  Science materials include magnifying glasses, photo libraries of animals and 
landforms, live plants and animals, five senses games, puzzles and sound bingo and microscopes.  Reading materials include 
big books, alphabet books, phonics books, puzzles, alphabet bingo, sight word bingo, flashcards, Spanish books, reading rods, 
matching reading games, computer programs and smartboard.  
 
Instructional materials  used to support reading for ELLs in the 12:1:1 classes include: The All Star English Addison Wesley

Court phonics program, Unique curriculum, SMILE curriculum, Sounds in Motion phonics, leveled libraries,  native language 
literature and reading rods, flashcards, i-pads, computers and smartboard. Content instructional materials that support ELLs in 
the 12:1:1 classes in math include the Equals program.  It contains math games, counters, flashcards, unifix cubes and money 
kits.  Science materials include Attainments Science Kits, magnifying glasses, scales, beakers and cooking supplies.  Cooking 
lessons are an excellent way to teach measurement, the process of evaporation, condensation, and many other science skills. 
Lakeshore theme boxes, reading rods, alphabet games, computer software programs: Connected to ESL, Boardmaker and 
Interactive Academic Lessons are all used to expand and complement ENL lessons in the classroom and in the stand alone ENL 
sessions for this subgroup.  Leveled libraries with multicultural books and visuals enhance the ENL program. 
The myOn.com and and mindplayvirtualreadingcoach.com are used in the after school program to develop literacy and 
comprehension skills.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All ENL instruction is delivered in English with native language support provided by an alternate placement paraprofessional 
who speaks the students’ native language in the students' classroom and during the integrated ENL sessions. During the ENL 
stand alone sessions students receive help in their native language either from the ENL teacher or from other students who 
can help those who may be less English proficient.  Spanish books are available in the ENL teacher's library and school 
library.  Many of the classroom libraries also contain Spanish books. Translation services are accessed on line and through the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

use of Spanish-English dictionaries to aid students with writing and class work. Additional materials in Spanish include 
computer programs and games.  The K12 Plaza computer program was purchased in 2015 which provides lessons in different 
languages. 
 
Formal Assessments like the NYSAA and SANDI as well as unit assessments are administered in the students’ native language if 
possible with the aid of alternate placement paraprofessionals or related service providers who work side by side with the 
teacher to deliver translation assistance. The students’ native language proficiency is evaluated according to the results of 
these assessments. Some students’ fare as well in English as they do in Spanish on these assessments indicating the students’ 
proficiency in both languages. 
 
P53K has no DL or TBE programs at this time. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services support and resources correspond to ELL's ages and grade levels.  The students in our special education 
school are grouped in a class with other students who are within three grade levels of each other.  P53K ELL students range 
from grades K-12 and the ENL groups are provided with curriculum resources and supports which are appropriate for their age 
and grade level.  The high school students with cognitive disabilities are presented with lessons which are aligned with the 
Common Core standards for high school level students just as they are in the general education population.  AGLIs or 
(alternate grade level indicators) provide adaptations to the standards and are utilized in all content areas in order to provide 
equal access to the high school curriculum for students with disabilities.  We use the Unique Curriculum which is designed for 
this purpose.  The lessons are based on the CCLS.  The Equals Math program is also differentiated according to grade level but 
is adapted for our special needs population.  The SMILE reading curriculum also is grade appropriate and is differentiated to 
accommodate special needs students.  The visuals and chants are geared to older students although it is teaching basic reading 
and writing skills.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Many of our special needs students in P53K participate in the inclusion program. These students attend the community 
general ed school that P53K shares space with.  They complete the same work and take the same assessments as their general 
ed counterparts. Our special needs students attend the same extracurricular activities and events with the general ed 
population in the co-located school. Both our special needs students as well as the general education students benefit from 
their interaction. Our special needs students learn to function and communicate effectively with their general education peers 
allowing for increased socialization which in turn improves English language skills. The general education students learn 
tolerance and compassion as they work with students with physical and mental challenges. Students share the auditorium, 
gym, cafeteria and library and are happy to interact socially. Students at our junior high school site participate in an art 
program with the general ed students. Students at our elementary site enjoy attending many of the assemblies and 
performances presented by the community school.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled students come with their parent(s) or guardian(s) to the school before they begin and are given a tour of the 
school by one of the unit coordinators, parent coordinator or guidance counselors.  Students and parents are given the 
opportunity to visit the classrooms, meet the teachers and students. The guidance counselor or unit coordinator provide 
parents with a description of the services and programs offered at our school.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered to ELLs are district 75 schools. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is presented to all staff members, including assistant principals, special education teachers, 
paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, psychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists and speech therapists on 
the contents and implications of the LAP plan as well as best instructional practices and compliance issues for ELLs. The ENL 
teachers attend workshops given by the District 75 Office of English Language Learners  on compliance issues and best 
instructional practices for ELLs. In an effort to disseminate this information, the ENL teachers provide turn-key training to staff. 
Professional development will also be provided by District 75 ELL department and DELLSS (Department of English Language 
Learners and Student Support). Jose P training will be offered to teachers and will be provided by the District 75 Office of 
English Language Learners.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
To ensure that new teaching staff receive the Jose P. training; accommodations will be made for them to attend the 
professional development on this topic which is provided by the District 75 Office of English Language Learners. At the 
beginning of the year new teachers are notified about the training and are encouraged to sign up. If classes are closed for the 
current session than an attempt will be made to find classes through another organization which provide the proper 
certification like DELLSS or I-Teach.  Records and copies are kept in the teachers' files. ENL teachers will continue to attend the 
District 75 Office of English Language Learners PDs which occur several times a year. They cover compliance issues and best 
instructional practices for students with disabilities. Teachers will receive training during the designated half PD days and full 
day PDs on compliance issues, best instructional practices and co-teaching strategies. Teachers will keep a record of all PD 
attended.  The school is provided with professional learning opportunities through the District 75 Office of ELLs which will 
assist non-ELL teachers in fulfilling their 15% PD requirement as per CR Part 154.2 and the 50% PD requirement for ELL 
teachers (ENL and bilingual). All teachers (including non-ELL) are invited to attend PDs given by the D75 Office of ELLs. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teachers in cooperation with the parent coordinator will schedule appointments with the parent of our ELL students 
at times convenient for both the teacher and parent. The classroom teacher will attend if she or he is available. Also related 
service providers who work with the student will be invited to attend. If the parent cannot make it into the school then an 
attempt will be made to contact them at home.  Interpretation services are usually provided by in house personnel or the 
translation unit is contacted if no one is available to translate. Also during the annual IEP meetings these topics will be 
covered.

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

During the Title III after school program, parents are invited to attend workshops and the sessions with their child. This year 
the LEAP art organization offered a Bilingual Literacy workshop. Parents regularly meet for functions and meetings. Also our 
transition teacher hosts a transition resource fair each year.  The parent coordinator holds monthly meetings with the parents. 
Parents are invited to attend school plays, musical performances and culminating unit projects presented by each class four 
times a year. P53K introduced a cooking program promoting healthy eating habits sponsored by a local charity and the parents 
were invited to attend. Both parents and students engaged in preparing healthy fresh wholesome meals.  Our ELL parents 
attended all the above events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Heather Leykam, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Students have a completed home language survey in his or her cumulative folders. Most of the students admitted 
to a District 75 school have already been in the Department of Education so the home language survey was 
completed when they first entered the school system and it is sent over from the previous school with the 
student's cum folder. The home language survey is analyzed to assess the language needs of the student and 
parent. Also parents fill out a blue emergency card with vital information including what language they speak. 
Various ATS reports, like the RPOB and information in SESIS are also beneficial in determining the language needs 
of the students and parents. Prior to parent meetings, IEP conferences, transition meetings and parent-teacher 
conferences, the language needs of the parents are discussed so that interpreters are available to assist them 
during the meetings/conferences. For parents who request written translation on Part III of the home language 
identification survey, all letters and notifications are sent home in the language they requested. The Parent 
Coordinator regularly contacts parents to follow up and assist with translation needs as it pertains to school, 
home and community. When no staff member is available to translate the Department of Education Translation

Unit will be contacted in a timely manner to ensure that someone will be present at the meeting or conference to 
translate in the parents’ native language.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

a school emergency.  
 

Assign bilingual staff to call parent. Identify family members who speak English listed on the student's blue emergency 
card and contact them. Call the interpretation unit if no one that speaks the language is available. The remind app is 
used by the parent coordinator to contact parents by text message. The app translates text messages from English 
into any language via the app on the parents' phone. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The Language Access Coordinator will inform staff during the staff development days prior to the first day of school. 
Resources available are the many in house staff who speak Spanish and Haitian Creole; the ENL teachers who ensure 
that parents of newly enrolled students receive a home language survey and complete the sections listing what 
language the parent prefers to receive both oral and written notices and information in; the Translation and 
Interpretation Unit; parent coordinator and transition teacher both who regularly interact with parents.

At the parent orientation meeting presented by the parent coordinator (who also serves as the LAC), at the beginning 
of the school year, parents will be informed of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification 
requirements for written translation and oral interpretation services. Parents whose primary language is a covered 
language will receive written documentation regarding their rights to these services and instructions on how to obtain 
them. To further assist and support families, notification that “Translation and Interpretation Services are Available” 
will be posted in different languages at the main entrance to inform parents of these services including the parent bill 
of rights.The Parent Coordinator and Transition Coordinator will regularly contact parents to follow-up and assist with 
oral interpretation needs as it pertains to school, home and community.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents will fill out a survey at the last monthly parent meeting with the parent coordinator in order to gather 
feedback on these matters. Surveys are reviewed by the parent coordinator and information gathered is reviewed and 
analyzed and appropriate measures are taken to ensure parent requests are implemented.
