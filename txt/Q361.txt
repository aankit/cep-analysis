Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of P.S. 361Q is to provide rigorous instruction that supports each individual child’s strengths, interests, 
and needs. Our school recognizes the unique gifts that each child brings to the community and utilizes these talents to 
motivate children to become life-long learners. We encourage our children to explore their curiosities, ask questions, 
work through real-life challenges, and collaborate with others to solve problems. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 361Q The Woodside Community School is a new elementary zoned school in Woodside, Queens. At full capacity, 
we will be serving approximately 500 PK-5 students in the Woodside community. We are excited to be a part of this 
dynamic, diverse community and are committed to providing a rigorous education, individualized for all our children 
in close partnership with our families and community. 

 

 

Through our work together, children will think critically, demonstrate effective problem solving skills, and 
communicate powerfully and compellingly with a wide-range of audiences. As a school community, we celebrate the 
unique gift in each child and support each child to become successful: academically, socially and emotionally in an 
environment of trust, safety and academic rigor that will prepare them for an ever changing global society. 

Core Values: 

● Rigor-We think critically as we explore our individual curiosities 

● Relevance-We work through real-life challenges 

● Relationships-We collaborate with and celebrate one another 

Performance Outcomes: 

Through our work together, our students will demonstrate: 

● Critical thinking skills, evidenced by the ability to read and analyze rigorous texts across content areas 

● Creativity in problem solving, evidenced by the performance level on project-based learning tasks 

● Communication skills, evidenced by the quality of oral and written presentations 

Our core values are embedded within all of our blueprint element, which reflect the elements of the Framework for 
Great Schools.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We currently have a large ELL population, as well as a growing SE population. Our ELLs have a need in building 
academic language skills. Our SE population is very diverse and their needs include further supports in their social 
emotional development, as well as academic intervention support. In addition, we currently have a large high 
performing students who need to be cognitively challenged for further growth. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

We made strides in creating and tightening systems, protocols, and programs that provide a supportive environment 
for our students and families. Our key area of focus for this school year is on building academic language skills under 
rigorous environment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year.

We believe that the ability to interpret authentic texts, think critically and present ideas clearly must be developed 
from an early age. Moreover, in reflecting on our school's current practices and student outcomes, we found a need 
to further improve our students' abilities to use academic language to reflect content and conceptual knowledge, 

Therefore, our instructional focus for 2018-19 is the following: 

All Woodside Community School’s students will show measurable growth in their ability to interpret authentic 
texts, think critically on grade-level, and present their ideas clearly, using academic language to reflect content and 
conceptual knowledge. 

Teachers will implement questioning and discussion strategies across content areas that support the development of 
students’ critical thinking skills. Success will be measured by student performance on Fountas & Pinnell Running 
Records, as well as Exemplars Assessments to be used three times a year for formal assessment of students' 
performance as well as informal assessments throughout the year to monitor student progress. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 70% of all students; including ENL and SWDs, will reflect content and conceptual knowledge using 
academic language. This will be measured by monitoring of performance on the Fountas & Pinnell running records 
assessments and growth in Exemplars performance.

support the four lab-sites, have teachers participate in TC 
Institutes for additional PD and support. The Lead Teachers will 
also turn-key the information back to the rest of the school 
community.  

Engage all teachers in cycles of frequent observation and 
walkthroughs. Through the cycles of observation, provide 
teachers with actionable feedback to improve instructional 
practices. With the support of the TDEC, analyze trends in the 
observation data to provide teachers with quality and relevant 
professional development to further support teachers. We will 
implement instructional rounds for teachers to visit other 
classrooms and share best practices.

As vertical teams, examine the "Ladder of Complexity" to ensure 
that students are utilizing academic vocabulary with increasing 
complexity as they move up in grades. 

Engage families in regular and frequent parent workshops to 
support their understanding of rigorous instruction and the 
Common Core Learning Standards across subject areas. In 
addition, support families by giving specific high utility words for 
use in the classroom and home and defining "academic

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
As a midpoint benchmark, by February 2019, 60% of all students will demonstrate the ability to think critically on 
grade-level in both ELA and Math. This will be measured by Fountas & Pinnell running records assessments and 
Exemplars Interim Assessment. Specifically, we will analyze the Accuracy and Comprehension components of the 
Fountas and Pinnell assessment to measure student ability in ELA. Specifically, we will examine Exemplars Problem 
Solving Assessments to measure student achievement in Math.  

Achievement in ELA will be measured by grade-level performance on the F & P Assessment. Measurement for critical 
thinking in Math will be measured by achieving at least "Practitioner" level on the Interim Exemplars assessment. 

The 60% benchmark is considered to be realistic for our student body. 

Instructional practice includes on-going use of these progress monitoring tools. As a result, achieving the 60% mid-
point benchmark by February is considered to be appropriately "Time Based." 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
F&P Running Records Assessment & Exemplars Assessments 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
P.S 361Q will measure the success of the action plan for this section by using this data:  

  The NYC School Survey 
  Attendance of children in the Beacon program 
  Afterschool and Enrichment Programs 
  AIS  
  PBIS 
  Advisory Program 
  Attendance of parents at parent workshops led by the parent workshop committee 
  Tuesday morning parent engagement time 
  Dial-A-Teacher  
  Remind App 

The result of the 2015-2016 School Survey shows that families feel very supported by our school's environment (Score 
of 99 in the Supportive Environment Element on the School Survey 2015-16). We would like to continue to strengthen 
our school environment by increasing our parental outreach even further and continuing to improve the systems and 
structures in the school that support our school culture.  

The results of the 2016-17 School survey show that families continue to feel supported by our school's environment. 
Four out of five measures of the Classroom Behavior section of the teacher survey had a positive response rate of 
100%. The only measure in the Classroom Behavior section of the teacher survey with a response rate below 100% 
positive was: "a lot or all of the students in their classes behave well in class even when the teacher isn't watching." 
This result suggests room for growth in students' independent use of social-emotional strategies.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, PS 361Q will establish a school wide culture where all students will take ownership in utilizing their 
social emotional learning skills in all school areas including common areas. This will be measured by 80% positive 
rating on the Supportive Environment section of the 2018-2019 NYC School Survey.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In collaboration with the PTA, a "parent workshop committee", 
will reflect on the workshops already offered and identify future 
topics of need and interest for parent workshops. PS 361 will 
hold a yearly workshop introducing the PBIS system and social 
emotional learning strategies to the parent community through 
PTA meetings. In collaboration with staff, the parent workshop 
committee will implement regular and on-going parent 
workshops (monthly), with the help of outside organizations. 
This work will be shared out quarterly at PTA meetings.  

Responsible parties will revisit the relationship formed with 
outside non-profit organizations for the BEACON program to 
assess whether the activities offered continue to be interesting 
and engaging activities for P.S. 361Q students and the Woodside 
community at large. Glows and Grows will be provided to the 
organization as feedback to them as to what is going well and 
what can be improved. Additionally, PS 361 will collaborate with 
the BEACON program and Woodside on the Move to introduce 
and implement the PBIS system and social-emotional learning 
strategies to the outside organizations.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At PS 361Q, we place high emphasis on critical thinking, problem solving, and communication skills. Our teachers are 
committed to the success and improvement of the students in their classes as well as our school at-large to ensure 
that our children think critically across content areas, problem solve in real-life situations, and communicate 
effectively; both orally and in written form.  

Through discussion with the instructional cabinet and other staff, we have decided to focus on making our planning 
time more relevant and more connected to our instructional goals. We also want to focus on the process of learning 
in our Monday PLCs.  

An area of particular focus will be on the use of high-utility words in the classroom, as we work towards providing 
children with the rich academic language needed to express themselves.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, P.S. 361Q will implement systems and structures to nurture the professional development of teachers and 
staff through Professional Learning Communities on the topic of using academic language to reflect content and 
conceptual knowledge, which will in turn deepen and inform their instructional practices in the classroom. This will be 
measured by an 80% positive rating on the peer collaboration and quality of professional development sections of the 
NYC school survey.

we still have lots of work to do to improve. By providing our teachers with regular opportunities to reflect on their 
own learning processes in PLCs, we will nurture the growth of our teachers and staff in deepening their understanding 
of the learning process, and deliver instructional & social-emotional support to further increase student achievement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

For the 2017-18 NYC School Survey, our school achieved 97% positive rating on the Strong Family-Community Ties 
portion. During our 2017-18 school year, school staff, PTA members, and SLT members have heard parent requests 
for more consistent interpretation and translation services. This year our school and PTA hosted a variety of family 
engagement events, including regular monthly events (e.g., Writing Celebrations, Breakfast with the Principal, PTA 
Parent Workshops) and special occasion events (e.g., Spring Concert, Awards Ceremonies, Family STEM Night, etc.). 
School staff and SLT members have noticed that the majority of families attend special occasion events, while 
attendance for more frequent monthly events is consistent but typically significantly lower than attendance for other 
special occasion events (between 10 and 40 parents), suggesting that families are likely to attend special school 
events, but also that some parents are either uninterested or unable to attend regular events held during the school 
day. School staff have also noticed and reported through anecdotal evidence that parents often ask questions about 
the school curriculum, especially regarding students' homework. Some parents have expressed interest in learning 
more about supporting student growth outside the classroom. This year the school and PTA have hosted some parent 
workshops regarding homework and curriculum, and we have identified a continuing need to engage parents in 
school curricula.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, P.S. 361Q families will be invited to parent workshops with a focus on how to strengthen and expand 
their knowledge in order to support their children in advanced literacies, building conceptual understandings, and 
developing social and emotional intelligence. This will be measured by a 94% parent satisfaction rating on the Parent 
Outreach section of the 2018-19 NYC School Survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 361Q The Woodside Community School, in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 361Q The Woodside Community School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

P.S. 361 Q is a new school that first opened its doors to Pre-K and kindergarten students in 
2015.  For the past three years, this school has served almost a quarter of the total student 
population who have been identified as English Language Learners.  We've noticed a trend that 
our English Language Learners are struggling most in the areas of speaking and writing.  As a 
result, we have determined that it would be beneficial to support our ELLs in all four modalities, 
but with an extra emphasis placed on speaking and writing. 
 
For the 2018 - 2019 school year, there are a total of 82 English Language Learners.  There are 
25 ELLs in kindergarten, 19 ELLs in Grade 1 and 20 ELLs in Grade 2 and 18 ELLs in Grade 
3.  The Title III Program will group students by grade and address student language needs within 
each grade level group. 
 
One Title III group will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 to 4:45 for 2 cycles of 5 
week sessions for a total of 10 weeks. 
 
Specifically for our "Entering" and/or "Emerging" students, there will be three groups of Title III 
morning classes on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 7:15 - 8:15 am for 2 cycles of 5 
week sessions for a total of 10 weeks. 
 
Instruction will be conducted in English by ENL certified teachers.   
 
Teachers will use the Fountas and PInnell Leveled Literacy Intervention materials with a specific 
focus on ENL methodologies and pedagogy.

PD topics will center around modality specific resources and instruction.  Topics such as, "How 
To Address Speaking Needs" and "Scaffolding Writing Instruction for ELLs" will be covered. 
 
Professional Development will be given before each 4 week cycle.  One PD day will be in the 
Fall and the other in the Spring.  Each PD session will last for one hour for a total of 2 hours for 
the year.  This component is at cost to the program.  The effectiveness of the PD sessions will be 
measured by a pre and post assessment within the targeted modality.  After reviewing the data 
regarding the effectiveness of the PD and implementation of specific strategies, the vertical ENL 
team will make a recommendation regarding the impact of progress of ELLs.  All PDs will be 
recorded with an agenda and a sign-in sheet.  Professional Development will be conducted ty the

Parental Engagement is critical to student achievement.  We value the involvement of parents in 
all facets of the educational process.  We therefore make sure that our parents are well-informed 
of the educational needs and services for their children.  An evaluation of our students' needs 
enables us to reach out to a broader community of parents by making an attempt to communicate 
with them in their preferred language.  Specifically, an evaluation of our students' families' 
preferred languages revealed that Spanish and Bengali were most common.   As a result, all 
Parental Engagement Activities will be conducted in English, with interpreters for  Spanish and 
Bengali.  Parent Workshops will be conducted on an on-going basis throughout the 
year.  Workshops occur during the school day, after school, and in the evenings so as to reach a 
wider range of parent groups.  Workshops will conducted by Ms. Hwang, the Principal, Ms. 
Loyd, the Assistant Principal, Ms. Kim, the ELL Coordinator, Ms. Cacioppo, the Parent 
Coordinator, ENL teachers such as Ms. Nali, Ms. Muller, Ms. Ham and Ms. 
Villacorta,  Community Based Organizations such as Woodside on the Move, and other DOE 
and/or community personnel.  Each workshop will be documented with agendas and sign-in 
sheets. 
 
We will be offering cycles of Parent Workshops specifically for parents of ELLs.   
There will be a minimum of one workshop per month for at least one hour. 
At the very least, there will an hour-long parent workshop on the first Friday of every month

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

1. It is imperative that we assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.   P.S. 361 assesses reading levels through the use of 
Fountas and Pinnell Running Records.  In addition, we use language checklists to monitor and address language specific needs 
of our students.  ELL students who are below grade level reading benchmarks will receive targeted instruction through small-
group strategy groups.  This is aligned with our school’s instructional plan in that we need to address the specific areas of need 
for individual students.  School staff is intent on developing instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments that work 
for everyone – not a single, one-size-fits-all solution, rather flexible approaches that can be customized and adjusted for 
individual needs.  Upon examination of the NYSITELL Modality Analysis, it is evident that 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
This is our founding year as a school.  We will begin to evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs beginning next school 
year. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

To provide ELLs with rigorous, culturally responsive instruction, a strong Response to Intervention (RTI) model should 
be in place. RtI is an instructional model that aims at prevention and early intervention through a tiered system of 
instructional support—one that adds layers of instructional support to the standard core curriculum delivered in a 
school, based on the demonstrated and changing needs of the student learners. This includes levels of intervention 
and instruction that increase in duration and intensity over time; as students improve, measured by reliable and valid 
assessments, the extra supports are removed.  Our school will use data from the NYSITELL, Teacher's College Early 
Literacy Assessments, Running Records, Content Area Asessments, and daily lesson checklists to guide instruction for 
ELLs within the RtI Framework.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

This is our founding year as a school.  We will begin to analyze data patterns beginning next school year. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our ELLs are receiving their ENL instuction via a Stand-Alone ENL model.  Depending on their proficiency levels, students are 
grouped so they are provided with the minimum units of ENL Instructional time.  "Entering" students are provided with a 
minimum of 360 minutes of ENL Instruction per week.  "Emerging" students are provided with a minimum of 360 minutes of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

ENL Instruction per week.  "Transitioning" students are provided with a minimum of 180 minutes of ENL Instruction per week. 
"Expanding " students are provided with 180 minutes of ENL Instruction per week.  All former ELLs will continue to receive 
services for an additional two years.  They will continue to receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in ELA/Core Content Area, or 
other approved Former ELL services for two additional years. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

           The fully certified ESOL teacher provides the targeted language instruction meeting with groups of students by their 
proficiency levels to ensure they are receiving the mandated number of instructional minutes.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
   Core content is delivered by the fully certified ESOL teachers in English.  Teachers uses differentiated strategies and materials 
to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  One example of such an approach is the increased use of visuals on the Promethean Board to make content more 
accessible. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
   Because we only have a Stand Alone ENL model, we do not evaluate our ELLs in their home languages throughout the year. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

6.   Teachers of ELL Students with Disabilities (SWDs) need to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English 
language development.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs use grade-level Go Math, FOSS Science, and Harcourt Social Studies 
materials.  Lessons are scaffolded and differentiated to address specific needs of students.  Instruction is further driven by IEPs 
that mandate ENL instruction.  ENL is often delivered through content area instruction.  Students are given precise scaffolds to 
enrich their understanding of content while developing language acquisition skills.  It is imperative that ENL teachers maintain 
on-going dialogue and articulation with Special Education teachers. The students’ IEPs will be reviewed carefully by the ENL 
teacher, classroom teacher, IEP teacher and the School Improvement (SIT) team in order to best meet the educational goals 
stated on the IEP. Formal and informal assessments will also be reviewed and analyzed by the SIT team. The SIT team, along 
with the classroom Special Ed. teacher will identify the stumbling blocks of progress: disability verses challenge caused by 
linguistic needs. When appropriate, teachers will provide the support of native language as well.  Students will have accessible 
to them books in their native language, content-area specific bilingual glossaries, and electronic translators.  ENL teachers will 
work hand in hand with the classroom Special Ed. teacher to bridge resources between the two areas. EN teachers and 
classroom teachers will attend professional development to learn best co-teaching methods. ELL-SWDs will be eligible for all 
academic intervention opportunities.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

P.S. 361Q is committed to meeting the needs of all our students, including our ELL-SWDs.  The focus for these students is to 
access curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility in order to meet needs within the least restrictive environment.  As a 
result, services are provided by fully certified teachers, both ENL and Special Education, within the classroom 
environment.  Through professional collaboration between service providers, ELL-SWDs receive the benefit of focused 
instruction that is tailored to indivual students' academic, emotional, social, and language needs.

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our ELLs are supported through the use of: 
*Promethean Board for visuals 
*Guided Reading Groups 
*Differentiated Fundations Groups 
*Listening Centers 
*Recording devices to record spoken responses 
*iPads 
*Hands-On Science manipulatives 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for

Guide, Professional Development section. 
N/A 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
N/A 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Professional development is critical for our community of educators.  We believe it is necessary to stay in touch with the most 
up-to-date research as well as learning about best practices.  School leaders, common branch teachers, paraprofessionals, ENL 
teachers, speech therapists, special education teachers, occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries, and 
community coordinators all contribute to the education of the whole child.  As a result, we have a firm belief that we must be 
equipped with the current necessary tools to achieve that goal.  To achieve that goal, P.S. 361 is committed to attending and 
providing professional development for our community of educators.  School staff will attend related and relevant professional 
development sessions throughout the city.  Within our school environment, there will be a minimum of  5 staff development 
workshops provided for the whole school staff during Professional Development, grade conferences,  and Lunch & 
Learn.  Sessions will be provided by the ELL Coordinator, ESOL teacher, Principal and other support staff. --September: 
Informative workshop on our school policy for identifying ELLs and our Language Allocation Policy. --October:  Assessing the 
language needs of ELLs in the 4 modalities. --November:  Literacy differentiated instruction and scaffolding techniques for ELLs

Professional development is offered to all teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  Targeted topics were addressed prior to the start of our founding school year during our staff on-boarding 
sessions.  On-going professional development is provided during extended time on Mondays and during grade level inquiry 
work time on Tuesdays.

Part V: ELL Identification Attestation 

Principal Certification 

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, P.S. 361 has a strong belief in parents as partners.  We believe that there must be 
open communication between student, school, and parent and a student’s success is facilitated by the 
combined efforts of all parties.  As a result, we strongly encourage parents to be involved in their child’s 
education.  Starting in September with Parent Orientations, Meet the Teacher, and Meet the 
Administrators, parents are encouraged to ask questions, explore, and immerse themselves in the various 
aspects of their child’s academic development.  The ELL Coordinator will meet at least once for an individual 
conference with parents of ELLs to discuss the child's language development.  Provisions are made for 
interpretation and translation through school staff, as well as services of the NYC DOE's Translation and 
Interpretation Unit., testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained 
on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 
6. 

7. 

8. 

9. 

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 
 
 

12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 361 respects and values the involvement of parents in all facets of the educational process. We therefore 
make sure that our parents are well informed of the educational needs and services for their children. All parents 
or guardians of newly enrolled students are required to complete a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
during registration. In Part 3, the Parent Information section of the survey, there are two questions that 
specifically ask parents about their preferred language for written information as well as oral communication. An 
evaluation of these responses enable us to reach out to a broader community of parents by making an attempt to 
communicate with them in their preferred language. Specifically, an evaluation of our students' families' 
preferred languages revealed that Spanish and Bengali were most common. As a result, written notices are 
translated into Spanish and Bengali. We utilize the Department of Education Translation Unit and in-house school 
staff to have documents translated in the appropriate languages so our parents are able to read and understand 
the documents being sent home. In addition, we make an attempt to provide interpretation services for parents 
who need assistance communicating with school staff. We have designated interpreters who are fluent in 
Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, Greek, Punjabi, French, Korean, and Chinese. We want all our parents to be

provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their 
child's education. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Based on the Home Language 
Identification Survey, we find that our 
school has parents who speak two major 
languages other than English; Spanish 
and Bengali. Our smaller language 
populations speak Arabic, Punjabi, Urdu, 
Chinese, and Romanian. In order for all 
our parents to have full access to the 
school and its staff, we need to 
consistently provide written and oral 
translations of all documents being sent 
home. In addition, we need increased 
oral translations during workshops, 
meetings, and Parent/Teacher 
Conferences.  

   

 

 

 

 

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.
