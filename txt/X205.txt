Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

P.S. 205’s mission statement is to provide students with a sound educational program, coupled with high 
expectations. We aim to provide opportunities for each individual to develop a Growth Mindset free from the fear of 
making mistakes in a community of learners where students love learning and embrace challenges. The three driving 
principles in our approach to teaching and learning are to ensure that rigor, purpose, and engagement are the basis 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

for all planning and instruction. Our goal is to ensure that the curiosity and excitement that students bring with them 
not only lasts, but also deepens as they journey through elementary school. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Demographics 

P.S. 205 is located in the heart of the Belmont section of the Bronx. We are a passionate school community dedicated 
to the educational development of all our students. It is a multi-ethnic population that has a strong sense of 
neighborhood pride and community. Our population is made up of 79.7% Hispanic, 14.7% Black, 5.1% white, and .5% 
Asian. P.S. 205 is comprised of approximately 1,015 students from grades Kindergarten through fifth grades. Our 
school is made up of two buildings located one block apart from each other. The “B” building houses students in 
Kindergarten and first grades. The “A’ building houses students in second through fifth grades. The “B” building has an 
open classroom setting with no walls. We are historically overcrowded, capping at least two grades every year.  

Collaborations/Partnerships/Special Initiatives 

P.S. 205 has a collaborative climate that supports our school in a very unique way. This positive environment leads to 
sharing and skillful planning among all teachers. Teacher teams consist of ICT teams (Special Ed. and General Ed. 
teachers), Collegial Teams (AIS providers and classroom teachers), Instructional Leads for Core Curriculum in ELA and 
Math, RTI Team, PBIS Team, SIT Team, and Grade Level Teams. Creative structuring of teacher teams assures quality 
planning, precise articulation, and diligent reviewing of data and student work to formulate next steps. Pedagogical 
teams enable teachers to consistently evaluate their effectiveness and drive instruction. Administrators, coaches, and 
teacher teams guarantee continuous accountability for effective instruction and student achievement. 

 

We have long standing partnerships with the following Community Based Organizations: Young Audiences New York, 
Bronx Zoo, Chess in the Schools, City Squash, National Geographic, Kiwanis and Fordham University. The partnership 
with Young Audiences New York allows our students to experience chorus, theater, violin, and visual arts. Additional 
partnerships such as Mighty Milers Runners Program and Asphalt Green support our students in maintaining a healthy 
and active lifestyle. This stays true to our belief that the whole child is worth educating beyond simply academics. 

The following opportunities are provided for children with the partnerships that we have developed to strengthen the 
whole child: 

  Art Residencies 
  Glee Club 
  Technology 
 
  Enrichment (Various Academic / Social / Physical Activities)

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Currently 22% of students from grades k-5 are identified as English Language Learners and 19.1% of students have an 
Individualize Education Plan.  

Special Student Populations 

P.S. 205 has a large population of students in temporary housing (144/1035). This year we qualified for a “Bridging the 
Gap” Social Worker because of the rise in students in temporary housing. The Social Worker will monitor students’ 
academic progress and the school will offer academic intervention services as well as after school assistance. The 
Social Worker will provide counseling sessions to strengthen their social emotional development. The Social Worker 
will serve as an advocate for students in temporary housing. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Most Progress and Key Focus for this School Year 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which P.S. 205 made the most progress over the past year were 
around Strong Family and Community Ties. We surpassed our goal of "85% of families will attend a minimum of one 
family community activity." As a result, we will provide additional opportunities for families to come to school to 
celebrate and participate in school events that impact our students at school, at home, and throughout their every 
day lives. 

 

An area of Focus for the School Year 2018-2019 is around Rigorous Instruction. We are looking to decrease the level 
1s in mathematics by focusing on problem solving strategies, accountable talk and exposing students to multi-
dimensional tasks. We will continue to work on cultivating a growth mindset that will help us step out of our comfort 
zone, make our thinking visible and give us the platform to maximize our learning. Teachers will participate in a lesson 
study. Within the lesson study, they will plan as a grade, execute lessons and reflect on best practices. They will 
analyze student work to make meaningful decisions about instructional next steps.

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

100 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

STH are immediately enrolled in school and provided with necessary school supplies/uniforms. If a student makes a 
transition from permanent housing into a temporary living situation, the pupil accounting secretaries will update the 
student's residency information and housing code in ATS. Every effort will be made to keep students in their school of 
origin. If possible, busing will be arranged or metro cards will be issued. Outreach will be made to the DOE Family 
Assistant at the temporary housing site to discuss the best interests of the student. Emergency variance requests are 
submitted for students who move from temporary housing into permanent housing for busing until the end of the 
current school year.  

Academic Intervention Services are provided as needed to students who require academic support. The student's 
academic progress will be monitored to determine if additional supports are required. The student's attendance will 
be monitored closely and meetings will be held by the attendance team with the parent/guardian to ensure 
consistent attendance. Weekly counseling services are offered for all students living in temporary housing by the STH 
social worker.  

Title I money will be utilized for supplies, clothing and school trips. PS 205 also has a food pantry for families in need. 
Additional outreach and referrals are made to community based organizations on an as needed basis.

The following plans are used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary school 
program at PS 205: 

● Representatives from pre-kindergarten programs are invited to visit the Kindergarten classrooms and meet with the 
teachers. 

Pre- Kindergarten students are invited to visit the Kindergarten classroom and meet with the teachers as well as tour 
the school building. 

● Incoming Kindergarten parents participate in a Parent Orientation. At this meeting, the parents have the 
opportunity to meet the classroom teachers as well as other school staff. Information is distributed regarding 
curriculum, Parent Association activities, a variety of parent workshops, homework, CCLS, programs, assessments, etc. 

During registration, parents are given a Kindergarten preparation packet created by teachers in order to help prepare

Teacher teams create grade level TC reading assessments and rubrics to assess student learning towards meeting the 
CCLS in literacy and math. 

● Teacher teams use a protocol for analyzing student work in order to surface the gaps and identify points of 
alignment with the CCLS and the Instructional Shifts demanded by the Common Core State Standards in 
literacy/math. 

● Teacher teams use data to make modifications in planning, implementing instructional strategies and designing 
assessments. They support and monitor the goal setting process as part of ongoing work to improve student 
engagement and self-assessment. 

● Teachers and support staff meet weekly to discuss their practice by establishing clear expectations of what effective 
teaching looks like and to have a shared language to discuss what is working and what needs to be improved to 
strengthen their assessments. 

● Teacher teams meet monthly to reflect on their instruction, their student progress and their next steps to reach 
their goals. 

● Teachers completed a PD survey indicating their topics of interest. 

● Teachers are members of the PD Committee and assisted in structuring the PD plan. 

● Teachers participated in selecting MOSL assessments. 

Teachers are members of various teams (SIT, RTI, SLT, PBIS, MOSL, PD) that are included in the decision making 
process.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use.

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Fiorello H. LaGuardia School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Fiorello H. Laguardia School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.  

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The Fiorello H. Laguardia School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support 
of student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities 
and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The following CS strategy has been integrated into academic instruction at the school: 

  Expanded Learning Time-We began implementing TC reading and writing units of study in grades K-1. As a 
result, there were no students in Kindergarten who were held over. There were only seven students who 
were held over in 2017 compared to 20 students who were held over in 2016. 

  Health and Wellness-  

 

Students received physical education, participated in Move to Improve and the Mille Millers. 

 

Family Engagement- 

 
 
 
 

Families attended regular Family Night events (Arts, Square dancing, etc.),. 
Families were invited to the end of the unit celebrations. 
Families were invited to participate in art residencies. 
Families attended workshops on various topics. 

  Attendance Improvement activities- 

Students received certificates for 100% attendance. 

Students with 100% attendance were invited to the end of the year attendance celebration. 

 
  The class within each grade was recognized who has the highest attendance. 
  Attendance was charted outside the lunchroom. 
 
  Bi-Weekly attendance meetings with the Attendance Teacher were held to discuss chronic absentees. 
  Monthly assemblies were conducted during the school day. 
 
 

School Aide called home after the second day absent. 
School Messenger calls were placed after the first day absent. 

 

The impact has been: 

Increased attendance and student engagement 

 
  Development of social and emotional skills resulting in a decrease in the number of suspensions and 

detentions 
Improvement of academic performance 

 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

By June 2019, 100% of 370 students will participate in a minimum of 90 hours of expanded learning time afterschool 
programs and will improve their attendance during the school day as measured by attendance records.  

Students will receive certificates for 100% or improved attendance  

 
  Attendance will be charted outside the lunchroom. 
  Attendance team will discuss chronic absentees. 
  Monday School Spirit Day 
 
 
 

School Aide will call home after the second day absent 
School Messenger calls will be placed after the first day absent. 
Students can receive a raffle ticket (could be virtual) for each week when they have full attendance. At the 
end of each month, the winning ticket is chosen. Obviously, the more tickets a pupil has, the greater chance 
they have of winning. 
Students with 100% attendance are invited to the end of the year attendance celebration 

 

 

By June 2019, 35% of K-5 students will meet ELA and Math end of year benchmarks for their grade as measured by 
end-of-year assessments. 

  Grade level teams will meet frequently to analyze running records data, identify trends and patterns, form 

groups and plan next instructional steps. 

  Professional learning communities (PLCs)will meet weekly to design differentiated tasks and activities to meet 

the needs of all of our student subgroups. 

  PLCs will design tasks that include multiple entry points to make the assignments more engaging and 

motivating, so that students can explore a topic through different avenues. 

  Teachers will create literacy tasks and allow students to choose which tasks they would like to complete to 

meet their needs.  

  Provide parents with multiple opportunities to engage in educational literacy parent workshops. This will 

include Parent Workshops in Common Core Learning Standards in Literacy, NYS ELA Exam, "Family Reading" 
to do at home, and Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project. Critical information and additional 
resources will be provided to parents during these workshops, i.e. educational literacy websites and 
applications 

  A Restorative Practice method will be modeled by the Social Worker in an effort to foster self-awareness, 

social-awareness, responsible decision-making, self-management, and relationship skills. Teachers will 
conduct one-on-one conferencing with students, group circles, and referral to counseling/clinical staff for 
additional support. 

  Utilize Social Work Interns to implement a peer mentoring program that each child will be known to at least 

by one adult as an individual, providing them meaningful learning experiences in a caring environment. 

 

By June 2018, we will increase family engagement and parent participation with a focus on the arts, literacy and 
social emotional intelligence. This will result in a 10% increase in parent attendance at workshops and or activities 
for the 2018 school year. 

  Use Google Docs system for teachers and CBOs to track opportunities offered for family engagement. 
  The Community School Director will plan parent workshops. 
  By the end of June 2019, 100% of students and staff will adhere to the PBIS PAWS protocol and curriculum, 
resulting in a decrease in student incidents and an improvement in classroom behaviors as evidenced by a

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
Expanded Learning Time- If students engage in TC reading and writing units of study then their reading 
comprehension will improve. If students engage in robotics, coding and video game design then their science and 
math skills will improve. 

Attendance Supports-If we provide students with choices, Pep Rallies and engaging activities that will motivate 
students to come to school. The attendance team will track student's attendance and follow-up with phone calls. 

Family Engagement- If we offer parents opportunities based on the results of the parent interest survey then parents 
will be involved and attend family engagement events. 

Health & Wellness-If students engage in health and wellness activities such as movement, yoga and rugby, students 
health will improve.

Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 1.  ASSESSMENT TOOLS: 
  
We currently use a variety of formative assessments in our school, in order to guide instruction for our ELLs. The NYSITELL and 
the Spanish LAB are administered as an entrance and placement exam, which determines the child’s proficiency level in 
English and/or the home language, (Spanish).   Fountas and Pinnell (running record) is used K-5 as both our benchmark and as 
an ongoing reading assessment in both English and Spanish, which demonstrates the child’s fluency and comprehension level 
in reading.  The ELA baseline, midline and endlines for grades 3-5, math baselines K-5, end of unit assessments in math and 
ELA and Imagine Learning program is used to track students’ progress in all modalities.  In addition, in order to identify areas of 
need of early literacy skills, grades K-3 will use DIBELS (IDEL in Spanish), which is a quick benchmark assessment tool. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

AIS staff collaborates with teachers in order to assess students, as well as to analyze and discuss results in order to tailor 
instruction targeting areas of need and provide support. The success of the ELL program is evaluated by consistently tracking 
and monitoring the effectiveness of ELL interventions and strategies. Ongoing assessments throughout the year and a variety 
of benchmarks, including student portfolios and individual student goals are also used to further evaluate the success of our 
program.  We compare ongoing assessments by analyzing and discussing findings in order to determine which teaching 
strategies worked and if needed, make modifications to address those areas of need.  Fountas and Pinnell data will be inputted 
on Google Docs for tracking and monitoring throughout the year.  On Demand and Post Writing results will be tracked and 
inputted in Google Docs. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 The summative assessments used to establish baselines, monitor progress through benchmarks and reassess goals in areas of 
need are;  ELL Periodic Assessment, NYSESLAT, Fountas & Pinnel Running Records, Math Chapter Tests at the end of each unit, 
MOSL assessments and monthly writing pieces focusing on curriculum units of study that incorporate different genres.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

AIS support staff, ENL and cluster teachers use data to determine areas of need and create lessons, groupings for 
differentiated activities in order to target and support students to demonstrate growth.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  P.S.205 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework by focusing on Tier 2 and Tier 3 students.  They will 
be progress monitored every 3-4 weeks with an assessment that meets their individual needs.  They will be assessed by the 
service provided at the beginning, middle and end of a 6-8 week cycle of intervention.  Student progress will  be revisited after 
each 6-8 week cycle.  At this time instructional changes and grouping of students will be made if necessary.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data outcome assessments used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are the NYSESLAT for grades K-5, as well as 
the ELA and Math for grades 4 and 5.  The ENL team, along with administrators sit to discuss growth, areas of need per grade 
and decide on targets, approaches and Professional Development by using the data on the ELL Data Analysis Tool and the 
RLAT for proficiency in modalities and mandated time.    
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our school uses our customized EDAT tool by desegregating the NYSESLAT exam into four modalities and their raw scores; 
facilitating functionality when analyzing.  We compare the NYSESLAT and ELA results, discussing proficiency levels and 
strengths in modalities to rationalize the reasons students scored a 4, 3,  or 2, 1  on the ELA.  We discuss Math results as well 
and compare the scores of those in their native language and English in order to plan our next steps.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school currently has one Self-Contained ENL classroom in third grade and three classes in which our certified ENL 
teachers Co-Teach; one in each grade 3, 4 and 5.  These classes have been specifically selected and ELLs 
heterogeneously grouped, addressing the English language proficiencies: Entering, Emergent, Transitioning, 
Expanding and Commanding.  We strive to provide the most comprehensive learning environment by implementing 
the integrated and standalone ENL as per CR-Part 154.  We Co-Teach during the literacy/ELA periods, servicing all 
students for their appropriate mandated minutes in addition to pulling out Entering and Emergent students for 
standalone ENL. 
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Currently, the school provides Transitional Bilingual/Early Exit Bilingual Education (Cloud & Genesee et 
 al, 2000) for grades K, 1 and 2. 
Transitional Bilingual Program (Spanish/English) – Based on our students’ level of English language and academic 
proficiency, the following program requirements as per CR-Part 154-2, are provided: 
  
•Home Language Arts (HLA) instruction for students, the minimum required of 180 minutes per week. 
• 75/25 (Spanish/English) model for Entering, 60/40 Emerging, and 25/75 for the Transitional/Expanding (providing 1 
unit of Stand Alone  ENL and 180 min. Integrated ENL/ELA for EN/EM /  1 unit of Integrated ENL/ELA for TR/EX ELLs). 
Providing a minimum of 2 content area subjects in the Home Language for EN/EM, and a minimum of 1 content area 
for TR/EX ELLs. 
     

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

  Based on parent choice, we do not have a DL program at this time. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

        Programs are always aligned with the parents’ choices for program placement.  In the past few years, parents have 
demonstrated a preference for the Transitional Bilingual program in the early grades and ENL in the upper grades.  As a result, 
the option for ENL placement has increased in the upper grades.  
 
          In the primary grades, K-2 are assigned certified and fully qualified bilingual teachers.  Accordingly, the mandated 
number of instructional minutes provided in the TBE and Free-standing ENL models is determined by the proficiency levels; 
 
EN/EM receive 360 min.; 180 Integrated ENL/ELA /180 Stand Alone ENL  (with Spanish/English 75/25 EN and 60/40 EM in TBE) 
TR and EX 180 min. Integrated ENL/ELA  (with 25/75 in TBE)  
Comm. 90 min.  Integrated ENL/ELA  
 
Integrated ENL/ELA in the Freestanding Program is delivered via Co-Teaching and dually certified teachers. 
 
In the TBE program explicit HLA instruction is delivered according to the CR Part 154-2; a minimum of 180 minutes per week.  
     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Students are grouped heterogeneously across the grades in our TBE, and ENL models.  Literacy groups in grades K-5 are 
differentiated using  F & P Running Records, NYSESLAT proficiency levels, modality raw sores (listening, speaking, reading, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

writing), the Periodic ELL Interim Assessment and ELA (grades 3-5).  For each instructional unit and individual lesson, teachers 
target students’ specific instructional needs in listening, speaking, reading and writing (by establishing Long-term and Short-
term SMART goals).  
  
        Content area instuction in the TBE classes are taught in their Home Language, in accordance with CR-Part 154-2.  The 
Stand Alone model adheres to each grade curriculum while using English with L1(home language) support, TPR, scaffolds and 
multi-sensory approaches targeting different learning styles and entry points to increase comprehensible input and ensure 
equal opportunity for learning.  
  
        ELLs bring many resources such as L1 and skills to boost L2(English language), talent and cultural practice and 
        perspectives, which we build upon by implementing sheltered instruction strategies: 
 
        -allotting additional time, practice and repetition                                                                                                                     -making 
instruction and expectations clear, focused and systematic                                                                                   -addressing both, 
language and content objectives in all lessons                                                                                         -building background 
knowledge and scaffolding  
          instruction                                                                                           
        -creating awareness of cognates for vocabulary instruction 
        -allowing opportunity for discourse and interaction; where language usage becomes a resource for  
          communication, thinking and reasoning.  
  
         It is imperative that we immerse our ELLs in a literacy-rich environment with a variety of language experiences, using 
formal register and domain specific vocabulary, in which students use academic language essential for high levels of 
achievement in the content areas. 
  
         Academic Intervention Services (AIS) certified teachers/instructors provide support for all classes during the literacy 
block.   
  
        Small group instruction is differentiated according to students’ demonstrated needs and their proficiency levels. 
  
        Stand Alone ENL – Based on students’ level of English language and academic proficiency, the following program is 
implemented across the content areas: 
•     ENL EN/EM              360 minutes per week 
•     ENL TR and EX         180 minutes per week 
•    HL                             As appropriate     
  
         Each model is  instructed by a licensed ENL teacher.  A Balanced Literacy Framework is implemented in the 
classroom.  The Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (S.I.O.P.) is used in the Stand Alone and Integrated ENL model to 
structure lessons, in conjunction with the Quality Teaching for English Learners (QTELL) strategies, to support academic 
language.  
        Differentiated Instructional techniques along with Higher Order Thinking Skills (H.O.T.S.) are also incorporated across the 
content areas (in both language models) to make it accessible and comprehensible, while at the same time rigorous for 
ELLs.  ENL and Bilingual teachers are encouraged to provide many hands-on activities that will provide and expose ELL students 
to a myriad of learning experiences that are communicative and purposeful, increasing comprehensible output – language use 
and development in English.                                                                                                                                                                               
          
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages, students are exposed to simulated math and 
science practice tests throughout the year. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 ELL academic learning is ensured by following the New York CCSS.  The use of scaffolds, multi-sensory approaches, 
differentiated activities and the use of L1 where appropriate assures comprehension for all proficiency levels. 
  
a. SIFE 
According to the data we currently have one SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) student.   
We understand that SIFE students require special attention to facilitate their transition to formal schooling and help decrease 
the educational gap. 
 
The following interventions are in place for SIFE students: 
 
•     Sheltered Instruction(making content accessible and meaningful)  
•     Review of interim assessments to track progress (i.e., benchmarks) in target areas and to differentiate    
            instruction 
•     Continuous assessment of Long-term and Short-term goals to monitor progress and meeting benchmarks 
•     Extended day to provide reinforcement of essential skills 
•     Daily AIS to support literacy and content-area learning  
•    Home Language(Spanish) support as needed 
•     Counseling services and/or support as needed 
            Supportive environment which responds to social, cultural and linguistic needs 
             RTI 
  
b.  NEWCOMERS 
Presently we have 211 Newcomers.  Newcomers entering P.S. 205 in the early grades have the option of selecting the 
Transitional Bilingual program(Spanish/English), which is offered in grades K-2.  Newcomers entering the school in the third 
grade are offered a Self-Contained ENL class with a licensed ENL teacher, as per parental choice.  ELLs entering in the third, 
fourth and fifth grades, currently receive Integrated ENL/ELA, which is instruction to build English language skills through 
content area and Stand Alone ENL for EN/EM ELLs. 
In addition, Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are provided by highly qualified teachers in daily small group instruction, 
during regular school hours.  
  
The following interventions are offered for newcomers in grades K though 5: 
•     Extended day program provides targeted, small group instruction (grades 2-5) 
•     ENL strategies incorporated to scaffold language development across the modalities 
•     Our school’s parent coordinator provides ongoing support for the parents as they adapt to the school and their 
new neighborhood.  
 
  
c.  ELL STUDENTS (4-6 years)  
 In order to ensure that our 50 Developing students do not become Long-Term ELLs and continue to make Adequate Yearly 
Progress (AYP), teachers and support staff collaborate to create responsive language, literacy and content-area instruction.  It 
is essential that content-area material be readily accessible to our ELLs to ensure their success on the NYSESLAT, ELA, 
mathematics, and science state exams.

completion of each unit.  Progress reports are also used to plan next steps and differentiate lessons. 
  
•     Imagine Learning (Appropriate for all ELL Sub-groups at Entering/Emerging and Transitioning Proficiency Levels)  
Interactive program currently used to support the literacy development of targeted Second through Fifth Grade ELL 
students.  Imagine Learning English is a powerful teaching tool that integrates technology and a carefully prepared curriculum 
to differentiate literacy instruction.  The software program has been implemented in the Bilingual and Free-standing ENL 
programs to closely track and monitor ELL student literacy progress.  Imagine Learning also serves as excellent preparation for 
the NYSESLAT, since it also provides activities to build vocabulary development, listening and speaking, and phonemic 
awareness to support reading abilities.  It adapts to each students’ unique learning style and ability, allowing progress at an 
individually appropriate rate. The use of native language is included in the learning process on an as needed basis.  
  
Imagine Learning English also tracks vocabulary, letter knowledge, oral production, and phonemic awareness skills that are 
assessed and tracked for individual students.  Progress reports are used to create more responsive literacy and language 
instruction for each student.

reading skills and provide additional practice. 
   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
NEW IMPROVEMENTS/PROGRAMMING TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR TO SUPPORT ELLS: 
  
              Common Planning (Involves all Bilingual, ENL and Mainstream Classroom teachers when appropriate) 
Common planning periods are included for collaboration between the ENL and monolingual teachers during our weekly 
schedule. Teachers and support staff ensure that literacy and content area instruction is consistent and addresses the needs of 
our ELLs.   
  
              Literacy: ENL staff work with the classroom teachers to ensure that the balanced literacy model provides a bridge to 
English language acquisition.   
 
              The goal of the balanced literacy approach is to provide a rigorous and challenging curriculum for our ELLs and ensure 
appropriate grouping based on individual needs. 
 
             Co-teaching sessions are arranged to provide optimal literacy development via scaffolding reading and writing 
instruction for our ELLs during the Integrated ENL/ELA.  ENL teachers will collaborate with the mainstream teachers regularly in 
order to align ELL instruction with the Monthly Instructional Focus Calendar, as a way to ensure that students are accessing the 
core curriculum. 
  
   Content Area:  All staff collaborates to ensure that content area objectives are comprehensible to ELLs  
                 Co-Teaching sessions are planned to provide more explicit support and ensure students’ content area lessons are not 
only rigorous, but accessible and comprehensible.  
 
   ENL and Bilingual staff work with coaches to ensure that lessons and units are culturally sensitive and relevant to the student 
population. 
        
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

It is important to note that programs previously used will not be discontinued.  However, all resources that are currently being 
used have been re-evaluated as a result of summative and formative data to ensure the ELL materials are all being 
implemented under revised approaches to maximize student academic performance.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
After-School and Supplemental Services for ELLs  
  
To support ELLs access to the grade-level curricula, the interactive technology program, Imagine Learning English, will be 
implemented to track student progress and provide customized language instruction.  Fifty licenses of Imagine Learning English 
will be purchased to provide our ELL's in grades 2-5 with differentiated literacy instruction.  The program incorporates content-
area topics relevant to student learning in the classroom.  Progress reports generated by the Imagine Learning English program 
will be sent home to bridge the gap between parents and teachers.  The reports facilitate individualized homework and 
extension activities, while providing critical information for parents in the native language.  During our extended day period, 
we will provide students access to the Imagine Learning technology program. This supplemental program is above and beyond 
the mandated units of service. Students in grades 2 are also invited to participate in the Homework Club, enabling further 
clarification and successful completion of homework assignments.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

 Home language support is provided to all our students through use of bilingual dictionaries, home language classroom 
libraries and technology enrichment such as Imagine Learning and the buddy system. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required Support Services and Resources  
ELLs receive the required support services and resources that correspond to their ages and grade levels as per CR Part 
154.  Administration, coaches and ENL/Bil staff collaborate in analyzing and discussing research-based resources available.  We 
ensure correlation and cohesion between curriculum and resources, ensuring age and grade level appropriate. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building(co-location).  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Orientation For New Students( Including ELLs)  
At the beginning of the school year, students take part in neighborhood walks and in- house tours, and attend an orientation in 
order to familiarize them with their surroundings and create a comfort zone for the incoming students.  They are presented 
with the opportunity to meet and greet teachers and school personnel. 
 
Our guidance counselor, Jessica Sheehy works closely with students and families in order to make this process of moving on to 
middle school a smooth transition.  She sends home flyers about Open Houses, special entrance exams, etc..  She also sends 
this information via the school's messenger system.  The guidance counselor supports in assisting students with the middle 
school application process and schedules group and individualized meetings to guide students with their selections and 
information regarding middle school admissions and open houses.  She plans group visits to zoned school, so that the students 
can become familiar with the new setting.  
    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language Electives 
Currently, we do not offer a language elective in our school.  In previous years, we offered Italian and sign language as part of 
our Enrichment Program.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs:

  Common Planning: ENL Sessions 
During common planning periods, ENL direct instructors provide turnkey workshops on essential ENL strategies and 
interventions.  Classroom teachers, AIS providers, coaches, and Assistant Principals are trained in using the latest literacy 
interventions for ELLs, including Imagine Learning English.  In addition, ENL teachers may provide specialized workshops on 
requested topics.   
  
  Collaborative Planning: ENL, Bilingual, and Monolingual 
All teachers meet to discuss the content-area and literacy calendars.  ENL direct instructors support Bilingual and monolingual 
classroom teachers in differentiating their instruction for ELLs.  The curriculum calendars are more closely aligned to the 
ENL/ELA standards and are customized for individual student needs.  
  
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
       UFT, R-BERN and  DELLSS Training for ENL, Bilingual Teachers/Coordinators and Gen Ed Teachers: 
 
A variety of workshops and seminars are offered, which train service providers and coordinators in essential skills like data 
analysis, differentiated instruction, and program planning.  All interventions and strategies presented are research-based and 
have demonstrated a real potential to promote student achievement.  We post information on upcoming professional 
development addressing the needs of our ELLs, via our weekly newsletter and DOE e-mail, to all teachers and 
administrators.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers 
prescribed by CR Part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching

development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to the Chancellor's mandated parent teacher conferences, the school provides individual, informative meetings 
with parents of ELLs  on Tuesdays, during our 40 min. weekly parent engagement time.   
Parents have the opportunity to meet with ENL/Bil teachers in order to discuss goals of the program and strategies they could 
use at home to help their children in specific areas of need.  Also, we provide them with names and places of programs outside 
of the school in order for students to further develop their BICS and available resources in the community. 
The on-school staff provides interpretation in various languages mentioned on the Translation and Interpretation Plan. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

1.  At P.S. 205 parents are provided with ample opportunities to interact with teachers and school personnel.  A variety of 
workshops and orientations ensure that parents can become knowledgeable and active participants in their children’s 
education.   
  
Parents are invited to visit their child’s classroom on the first day of school, attend orientation meetings, and meet with the 
administration.  Throughout the year, parents are invited to: writing and reading celebrations, family nights, the annual plant 
sale, the annual book fair, open school week, classroom trips, and parent field trips and workshops.  Ongoing parent 
orientations provide parents with essential information about their child’s instructional program.  
  
Each month, parents are invited to attend the Parent Association meetings, during which they receive updates on various 
school issues.  Parents are also invited to participate in our numerous Young Audience Residency Programs and our Adult ENL 
After-school Class.  An Adult Parenting Class is also offered to parents. Through their participation in these activities, parents 
are able to develop personal skills as well as attain a better understanding of their child’s academic life. A school calendar and 
a monthly principal’s newsletter ensure that parents are always informed about school activities and programs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jenneth Santiago-Lagares, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 205’s largest population is Latino with a small diverse population of Middle Easteners, Asians, Albanians, and 
Africans. This has been confirmed by closely monitoring the Parent Preferred Language in the Home Language 
Identification Survey, which is completed upon admission by the parent/guardian. This information is entered into 
ATS immediately. Based on the information analyzed from the School Staff Language Survey we identify the 
languages covered in-house and those requiring Translation Interpretation services. Amongst the P.S. 205's staff, 
we have language proficient members in English, Spanish, Albanian, French, Haitian-Creole and Korean. 
Additionally, one of our parents in the PTA is proficient in Arabic! We ensure proper communication by translating 
correspondence sent to parents in their preferred language. Our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Laureano is 
biliterate(Spanish) and is readily available to assist parents. She interprets at all workshops; PA meetings, Library 
Orientation, to name a few. Also, she is an active participant during Parent Teacher Conferences and translates 
our monthly Parent Newsletter and now our Family Handbook. Parents are always aware of school events and

situations given the availability of translators on staff, and translated home-school correspondence. We also use 
resources such as computer translation programs as well as the Translation and Interpretation Unit services for 
low incidence languages. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We send phone messages and utilize staff available to interpret messages in parents' preferred language. Teachers 
are provided with a list of students' names, parents' preferred language, contact numbers and the 1800 Language Line 
number with school's DBN. 

On the other hand, when parents contact the school, trained office staff contact the 1800 Language Line number in 
order to communicate.

what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In-house Professional Development for accessing translation and over the phone interpretation services from the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit, will be provided for all staff members. Distribution and awareness on language 
access information and resources will be made by the LAC. Office staff will be trained on policies and procedures in 
order to meet the needs of the parents when they arrive, in turn creating a welcoming environment.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school, in accordance with Regulation A663, has designated Ana Laureano, our full-time Parent Coordinator, and 
Niurka Infante, our ENL Coordinator/Provider as our Language Access Coordinators. They are committed to addressing 
parents’ language needs, possessing strong communication skills, familiarity with the language needs of the school’s 
parent population, and the school’s budget and procurement processes.  

Via DOE training they are prepared to support the school in monitoring parent language needs, identifying school staff 
who are qualified and available to provide interpretation assistance, allocating funding to provide language assistance, 
and informing parents of the availability of language assistance services. 

Posting of signage around in the languages spoken by parents of children in our school, as well as DOE's poster of 
languages not covered.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Through parent surveys and evaluations, the school is more attuned to the needs, talents and concerns of our 
parents. Parents are able to share their comments and suggestions after each workshop, parent orientation, and 
parent/teachers conference. In addition, parents have the opportunity to provide their input when completing the 
P.S. 205 Parent Questionnaire and the DOE Annual Parent’s Survey. Scheduling a focus group of parents inclusive of all 
cultures and languages represented in our school is underway, in order to support feedback and discuss best practices 
on communicating with families. Activities which actively engage our parents and staff ensure that the school fosters 
a collaborative community of learners. Research has proven that when parents are involved in their children’s 
academic lives, students are more successful. Through their participation in so many activities, parents are 
empowered and develop productive relationships with teachers and staff members. Our parent workshops, Adult ENL 
classes and activities not only give our parents ideas and explicit tools to help their children with homework and study 
habits, but also empower them with life skills.
