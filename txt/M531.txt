Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Repertory Company High School uses deep engagement with the performing arts to inspire academic achievement, 
cultural awareness and a lifelong love of learning. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Repertory Company H.S. provides a dynamic learning environment by utilizing the creativity and discipline of the 
performing arts.We work as a team to develop a holistic learning program that aims to reduce fragmentation and 
isolation. The staff is committed to collaborate with artists, cultural institutions, and communities as an integral part 
of the learning environment. We prepare our students for the challenges of higher education, helping them acquire 
the social and interpersonal skills necessary to function in society while maintaining a belief in themselves and their 
dreams. 

 

School Strengths and Accomplishments: 

  Outstanding performing arts program where students earn an Arts Endorsed Diploma. 
Small nurturing environment where students become well known individually by staff. 
 
  High graduation rate. 
  High Attendance rate. 
  Consistent student progress. 
  Many college and career preparatory classes. 
  The use of Google Classroom for assessing student work as a school community and enabling students to set 

 

 

goals and reflect on their progress. 
School-wide grade level research projects. The standards or skill sets required are scaffolded by grade level 
(e.g. The freshmen are given a thesis and the research resources, the sophomores choose their thesis 
statements from a list but conduct research on their own and eventually...the seniors create an exit project 
where they analyze a masterwork, write a research paper, and direct a play). The projects are aligned to the 
common core learning standards. The idea is to build their research skills over the course of their high school 
career. 
Strategic partnerships with outside institutions in the Arts; City Center, Roundabout Theatre, Young People’s 
Chorus, Little Kids Rock, LeAp Onstage, Town Hall, etc. These partnerships provide our students the 
opportunity to acquire real life application in the performing arts. 

 

Key areas of focus: 

 

 

Instructional Focus: 

 
  Task design across all subject areas that demand synthesis of multiple data points to craft a 

 

 

thesis/solution/argument, in order to drive progress in students’ development of college-level synthesis skills 
Implement a Professional Learning curriculum and Team Meeting structure with access and equity at the 
core, in order to increase the capacity of teachers to develop culturally-responsive delivery of meaningful 
content that demands metacognition and offers targeted supports. 
Implement a parental outreach and engagement program that drives inclusion of marginalized voices 
within our community 

Challenges: 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Our small school environment coupled with the required 10 course theatre arts sequence of classes for the arts 
endorsement constricts our ability to offer other electives. 

  A small staff of 16 teachers makes it difficult to maintain consistency from one year to another when there 

is a teacher turnover of more than 2. 

  Our location in the heart of Manhattan, while central to our Arts focus, is not conducive to community 

outreach for our parent body, who live throughout the five boroughs. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a small population of ELL or Former ELL students who benefit from push-in and pull-out ENL services. 

 

We have approximately 38 Special Education students who benefit from co-taught classes, related services and 
testing accommodations. 

 

We have approximately 12 students in temporary housing who benefit from referrals to CBOs, supplies and consistent 
outreach. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the area of Rigorous Instruction, we added three new AP courses (Psychology, Environmental Science and Spanish) 
that have allowed more students access to college-level curriculum, and differentiated our offerings. 

 

In the area of Supportive Environment, teachers felt a need for greater involvement in the school-wide decision-
making process concerning discipline and culture.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The strengths and needs are based on the following data: School Quality Snapshot, teacher ratings from Advance, 
school survey, team meeting data, Instructionally Targeted Assessments, summative school-wide assessments, 
student led conferences, and College Board assessments. 

 

STRENGTHS: 

  92% of teachers say that the principal encourages feedback through regular meetings with parent and teacher 

leaders 

  92% of teachers say that the principal carefully tracks student academic progress. 
  92% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning.

Specific – see above 

Measurable – Measurement conducted via performance on AP exams 

Achievable – Similar increases have been observed in previous years 

Relevant – While our graduation rate is consistently very high, application and acceptance to selective colleges, as well 
as college retention rates, do not consistently align to those results. 

Time-bound: By the end of this the first semester and academic year, performance data should indicate a shift in 
alignment of scholarship reports to AP assessment performance.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All staff have content area certification in the majority of their scheduled programs. Professional development 
sessions will be held bi-weekly to support teachers when instituting these new initiatives and instructional changes. In 
addition, both grade team and subject area meetings will occur twice a month to allow communication among 
teachers and support systems to increase the effectiveness of implementation. Peer inter-visitations will also be 
conducted throughout the year where teachers will observe one another’s classrooms to observe best practices and 
provide feedback on ways to strengthen lessons and promote more rigor in the classrooms. Lastly, teachers will also 
be sent to offsite professional development opportunities led by both the network and outside organizations to 
provide the additional support and guidance when needed.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Repertory Company High School for Theatre Arts, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Repertory Company High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

Offering sessions at Parental Engagement activities (Tuesday afternoons, Curriculum Night, Parent-Teacher 
Conferences, Knowledge for College Day) devoted to explanation of credit and exam requirements specific to our 
academic and arts program. 

Giving all parents copies of practice exams (Regents, AP, PSAT, SAT) associated with their child's classes, 

 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and

inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In addition to careful review of the NYSESLAT and Interim Assessments, literacy skills for our ELL students are assessed using a 
teacher-created pre-assessment tool in their ELA classes.  The results of this assessment make clear the specific skill-
development and comprehension needs of our ELLs, and informs both the academic interventions and specific instructional 
strategies we will use to drive their continued improvement.  During team meetings, electronic portfolios are accessed and 
student work is reviewed, with particular focus on the ELL population and their acquisition of language skills.  Our most recent 
results indicate a trend consistent with NYSESLAT scores, with all three of our Expanding ELL students maintaining progress 
commensurate with their non-ELL peers.  This informs our instructional plan by providing insight into the specific skills and 
CCLS that our ELLs are lacking, so that we can target instruction through in-class lessons, translated materials, one-on-one 
push-in and afterschool tutoring.  It also influences our programming decisions, particularly when it comes to eligibility for 
Advanced classes.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Periodic Assessments, pre-assessments in ELA classes, horizontal and vertical team meetings, co-planning sessions for teachers 
of ELL students, AP class opt-in protocol, Monday PD sessions 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ELL programs is evaluated using various points of qualitative and quantitative data.  Summative assessment, 
State Examination, ITA and interim progress data are broken down by our School Leadership Team and data specialist to reveal 
trends among subgroups (including ELLs) that might affect our Progress Report, AYP or other data. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

LAP Team, SLT, Cabinet, Data team meetings, horizontal and vertical teaming, After-School Tutoring Program, Saturday 
Academy, Peer Mentoring, Advisory 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not Applicable  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
This year, we have three Expanding students.  This represents a significant improvement over last year's data, as each ELL 
student moved several points from last year's score.  Data from the Spring 2016 NYSESLAT indicate that, across performance 
levels, our ELL students struggle most significantly with writing skills.  Reading, speaking and listening scores are more evenly 
distributed and higher overall.  This points to the need for strong focus on these students' encoding skills, particularly as they 
move towards the ELA and History Regents exams, where their writing skills will be particularly applicable. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Monday PD sessions, Parental Engagement time, horizontal and vertical teaming, co-planning sessions for teachers of ELLs, 
Cabinet meetings, SLT meetings 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students travel for most of their day in groups with their graduation cohort, taking required core classes and 
electives.  ELL students are serviced during one of their ELA/core classes with the required units of Integrated ENL 
study.  ELL students are grouped heterogenously in terms of proficiency level,  and programmed according to 
demonstrated academic strengths and weaknesses, as well as graduation requirements and sequencing.  Service is 
provided by certified ESL teacher during designated periods and days/wk, equalling 180 minutes/week for Expanding 
ELLs, and 90 minutes/wk for Commanding ELLs for two additional years.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           At the beginning of the year, a schedule was determined for certified ESL teacher, allowing him to provide service during 
designated periods and days/wk, equalling 540 minutes/wk for Entering ELLs, 360 minutes/wk for Emerging ELLs, 180 
minutes/week for Transitioning and Expanding ELLs, and either 90 minutes/wk for Commanding ELLs for two additional years.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   For our Integrated ENL model, content is delivered to a heterogenuous LEP/EP group in the relevant content areas.  The 
instruction is delivered in English and includes on the domains of reading, writing, listening and speaking, with supplemental 
materials and instruction made available in the students' native languages.  Communication and coordination between 
content teachers and the ESL teacher ensures that ESL instruction aligns to core content instruction and vice-versa.  Writing 
and vocabulary acquisition are supported through the use of student-generated glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, online 
translation tools, native-language content glossaries supplied by the Board of Regents as well as student ePortfolios that allow 
teacher teams to analyze student work and progress towards standards.  All class curricula has been aligned to the Common 
Core Learning Standards to support development of ELA skills for college readiness. Our ninth-grade ELA teacher is part of our 
LAP team and has been given resources and strategies to provide extra support to these students.  Our ESL teacher has led 
turnkey PDs for all teachers on integrated ENL instruction, and all teachers adapt their lessons to include entry points and 
adaptations for ELL students as per our school-wide lesson plan format.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   All content areas have native language supports embedded in instruction, including glossaries, supplementary texts and 
translation tools that meet the needs of specific tasks and specific students.  Students' LOTE program in Spanish also provides 
support and assessment opportunitities in their home language, as 67% of our ELL population has a home language of Spanish. 
In-school assessments, as well as State examinations both in English and home languages, are analyzed to determine areas of 
weakness, so that instructional supports may be put in place.  In addition, the ESL teacher provides one-on-one support during 
core classes and after school to assess home language and new language development.  His findings are shared with teacher 
teams during student work analysis. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

A.    SIFE students are provided academic supports such as strategic in-class groupings, after-school tutoring and Saturday 
school.  After the initial SIFE questionnaire is conducted by the Guidance Counselor, a determination is made as to whether 
these students would benefit from regular or informal counseling sessions. 
B.    Newcomers use student-generated glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, online translation tools, native-language content 
glossaries supplied by the Board of Regents as well as student ePortfolios that allow teacher teams to analyze student work 
and progress towards standards.  In addition, all teachers receive PD on the implementation of multiple entry points and 
language acquisition supports for ELL students, aligned to our school-wide lesson plan format.  The focus for Newcomers is on 
the acquisition of the skills that will prepare them for their first experience with the NYSESLAT exam. 
C.   Developing ELLs use student-generated glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, online translation tools, native-language content 
glossaries supplied by the Board of Regents as well as student ePortfolios that allow teacher teams to analyze student work 
and progress towards standards.  The focus for Developing ELLs is on the acqusition of the skills that will allow them to 
progress in all four modalities tested by the NYSESLAT. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

D.  Long term ELLs use student-generated glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, online translation tools, native-language content 
glossaries supplied by the Board of Regents as well as student ePortfolios that allow teacher teams to analyze student work 
and progress towards standards.  The focus for Long term ELLs is on the acqusition of the skills that will allow them to 
strengthen any remaining weaknesses in the four modalities tested by the NYSESLAT, in order to achieve a score of 
Commanding. 
E.    Former ELLs for up to two years after exiting ELL status are provided with at least .5 units of study per week in Integrated 
ENL.  In addition, their ePortfolios are used by teacher teams to target instructional strategies that will help them with their 
continued language acquisition and mastery.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All teachers of ELL-SWDs use differentiated instructional techniques to ensure that the needs of these students are met.  These 
strategies include targeted small-group instruction, native-language graphic organizers, subject-specific glossaries, scaffolded 
native-language and new-langauge writing templates and annotation strategies for nonfiction text.  These techniques are 
integrated into our school-wide lesson plan template used by all teachers.  Grade-level materials are specified by grade-level 
teacher teams and tailored to college readiness standards for that grade, as well as content standards from the Regents 
examination associated with that grade level. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our afterschool tutoring sessions offer an opportunity for ELL students to be flexibly programmed to receive supplemental 
support.  Additionally, ELL students have been strategically placed in specific, heterogeneous cohorts to allow for simultaneous 
delivery of instructional strategies and content.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Data is analyzed from NYSESLAT scores, Regents examinations, in-school assessments, ePortfolio assignments, Skedula records 
and Interim Assessments in order to determine the need for targeted intervention programs for ELLs in core content 
areas.  Based on this review of data, native-language supports such as glossaries, translation technology and translated 
Regents materials.  Further intervention services include after-school tutoring, Saturday school, additional teacher support and 
bilingual peer tutoring.  Whole-school literacy strategies will provide ELLs with a consistent model of successful text-decoding 
habits and stratgies.  Supplemental translated materials allows ELLs to access curricular material.  Consultation with ESL 
specialist allows for periodic assessment of progress. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the revised CR Part 154-2, new strategies are being considered to meet the needs of Former ELLs, as well as current 
ELLs who are anticipated to attain a score of Commanding on the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT.   After-school writing programs 
focused on CCLS-aligned essay formats would address gaps identified in NYSESLAT scores, particularly in the Writing modality.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No services are currently be considered for elimination.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students are grouped heterogeneously for their academic classes, and offered equal access to afterschool programs such as 
arts, tutoring and community service opportunities.  The performing arts offers an unparellelled opportunity for inclusion of all 
learners, including ELLs.  Many ELLs and Former ELLs have leadership roles in our student government, lead roles in our 
productions and technical theatre teams, and participate in Advanced Classes.  These community involvement opportunities 
allow ELLs access to important academic and artistic programs that build self-esteem and support academic 
development.  Notifications of afterschool and supplemental opportunities are sent home in parents' preferred languages. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELL students are provided with laptops and translators,  where appropriate, to supplement their instruction and allow for 
access to text-to-speech and speech-to-text technology.  Online translation tools and applications such as WordLens provide 
ELLs with the ability to acquire native-language support for writing and reading activities.  Translated texts of both fiction and 
nonfiction texts are made available as well.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Within our Integrated ENL program, students use student-generated glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, online translation tools, 
native-language content glossaries supplied by the Board of Regents as well as student ePortfolios (combined with the use of 
online translation tools) that allow teacher teams to analyze student work and progress towards standards.  In addition, all 
teachers receive PD on the implementation of multiple entry points and language acquisition supports for ELL students, 
aligned to our school-wide lesson plan format.  Bilingual peer tutors are also able to support home language development. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All of our ELLs will have access to grade-specific resources (e.g., targeted support for the Living Environment and Algebra 
Regents exams). Grade-level materials are specified by grade-level teacher teams and tailored to college readiness standards 
for that grade, as well as content standards from the Regents examination associated with that grade level.  Evaluation of 
these services and resources is completed at the conclusion of each school year by the LAP team, including the ESL teacher.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are not co-located 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our New Student Orientation program offers ELLs a chance to interact with EP peers, develop self-confidence and enthusiasm 
through arts programming, and visit cultural landmarks of New York City.   Our Parent Orientation provides parents an 
opportunity to view the Parent Orientation video in order to make the most informed possible decision about ELL 
programming for their child.  The Guidance Counselor (Melissa Jimenez) and Parent Coordinator (Deborah Nevarez) work in 
cooperation with the parents and students to ensure that programming reflects the needs and skills of ELL students.  Principal 
Michael Fram consults with parents upon identification of a home language other than English. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our LOTE program consists of 2 semesters of language (Spanish is the most common language) offered to all students, 
including ELLs. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
During weekly PDs on Monday afternoons, the ESL teacher turnkeys workshops on supports and services for ELL students.  All 
teachers as well as the pupil personnel secretary are in attendance, and teachers are given training in how to apply these 
strategies to their particular content area.  Topics covered include analysis of NYSESLAT results, differentiated instruction and 
entry points for ELLs, parent outreach and cultural awareness.  Staff is also informed of translation and interpretation services 
available for outreach and translation of materials.  Agendas and signed attendance sheet are maintained by Assistant 
Principal Kayann Dell. 
During weekly PDs on Monday afternoons, teachers of ELLs break down the Common Core Learning Standards and analyze 
them to develop strategies to ensure progress towards mastery among ELL students.  Workshops are often led by teachers 
who have attended PD outside of school on the CCLS, and teachers work together to develop strategies for their particular 
content area.  Teachers are also trained by Assistant Principal Keeshon Morrow on the use of Atlas Rubicon curriculum 
mapping software, which allows simple alignment of units to CCLS, as well as the ability to embed ELL-specific strategies into 
unit plans. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Incoming 9  th   grade ELLs are identified to staff early in the year, and NYSESLAT and previous-school data are broken down 
into various modalities to make teachers aware of the students' strengths and needs.  Parent Bulletins translated into home 
languages help orient students and parents to the rigors of high school instruction, and make the community aware of 
academic initiatives and support.  Guidance Counselor Melissa Jimenez assists students in understanding high school 
programming, and making adjustments as needed for the particular needs of our incoming ELLs.  
Of the 2,880 minutes of PD contractually mandated throughout the academic year, at least 432 minutes are dedicated to ELL-
specific professional development, including the supports described above.  Agendas and attendance are maintained by 
Assistant Principal Kayann Dell.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parental engagement time is used to discuss ELL goals, language development process, proficiency assessment results and 
needs with parents.  Additionally, parent outreach is made via phone and Skedula, and recorded in anecdotal logs.  Beyond 
that, Knowledge for College Day, performances, assemblies and open house events provide further opportunities to discuss 
progress with parents of ELLs. Interpretation and translation services are provided by staff when available, or else utilizing the 
services provided by the office of translation and interpretation services. Parent Coordinator Deborah Nevarez and Guidance 
Counselor Melissa Jimenez provide onsite translation and interpretation services during all parent functions. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
As a performing-arts school, we offer a plethora of opportunities for parental involvement.  Specifically, our Hispanic Heritage 
Month assembly provides parents the opportunity to engage in a school event that celebrates their home language and 
cultures (90% of our ELL/former ELL population is Spanish-speaking, and 44% of our total population identifies as 
Hispanic).  Other specific opportunities include the Black History Month assembly, Pride Assembly, five performances of the 
Straight Play, five performances of the Musical, Open House, PTA meetings, student-sponsored dances and events, Senior

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Fram, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English

  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Distribution of the HLIS is done at the beginning of the academic year by the pupil personnel secretary, followed 
up by administration of informal interviews by Principal Manuel Urena, Assistant Principal Michael Fram or 
Assistant Principal Joan Weaver. The information gathered in terms of home languages, language preferences and 
specific needs is added to existing information in our family contact database. The information is relayed to the 
Strategic Planning Committee, who disseminates decisions based on that data to teachers and staff through 
electronic communication, staff meetings and individual conferences.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
