Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

environment, providing equity in our diverse learning community across all disciplines, making our students become 
leaders, change makers, active citizens and empowered members of our community.  

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 140 Manhattan is a pre-kindergarten grade 8 community-based organization located in Lower East Side servicing 
approximately 389 students.  

 

Over the years PS 140 Manhattan has established collaborations with community-based and citywide partnerships 
with Educational Alliance, Morgan Stanley, New York Cares, Math in the City, Reading Partners, Asphalt Green, and 
Henry Street. The programs bring much needed resources to the school by providing after school and school based 
services. The school also has partnerships with artists’ in residence programs: Artists Space, Marquise Studio and 
Rosie's Broadway Kids. These programs augment the importance of the arts in the school curriculum and the 
expansion of our students’ appreciation of the arts in their daily lives. After school programs, such as SONY with 
Educational Alliance is designed to address the academic needs of students are offered as part of the school’s 
commitment to improve academic success.  

All classrooms have SMART Boards, computer pods and a plethora of classroom library materials. The school houses a 
technology laboratory for use during the school day and a middle school science laboratory that provides service to 
students in grades 6 through 8. Our science program also include Zspace - virtual technology. Students in grades 
kindergarten through grade 5 are provided with science instruction in the school’s science cluster program. All 
students are programmed to the school library a minimum of one to two periods per week for literacy enrichment 
and research activities.  

Daily small group instruction, one-to-one conferences and station work provide students with a variety of 
opportunities to work collaboratively and independently. This enables teachers to differentiate instruction during the 
school day. The tone of the school building is reflective of the students’ interest in learning; as well as the entire 
school community’s commitment to provide a safe and educationally focused environment. Teachers have high 
expectations and students are engaged in the learning process and Socratic seminars. Our school has also 
incorporated restorative circles. 

 

Parent workshops are provided by the Parent Coordinator, Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and teaching staff. The 
workshops are aligned to parental need and interest. The school has also experienced an interest by parents to 
become more involved in the education of their children. Monthly School Leadership Team and PTA meetings afford 
parents the opportunity to share and contribute to the overall educational process taking place in the school. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student demographics are as follows: Hispanic – 80%, African American 14%, Asian 2%, and Others 4%. The 
school consists of general education, special education and English as Second Language (ELL) students. The latest data 
indicates the following pertaining to student cohort groups: Special Education – 36%, ELL – 18%, and General 
Education – 56%. The school provides Special Education services in self-contained, Special Education Teacher Support 
Services (SETSS) and Integrated Co- Teaching (ICT), ELL and General Education classes. The middle school program 
which houses students in grades 6 to 8 is departmentalized and follows a middle school program track

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

A Quality Review (QR) conducted in the 2017/2018 school year indicated that 01M140 was proficient in all parts of 
the rubric, with exception of leveraging resources and monitoring and revising systems, where the rating was well-
developed. We will continue a focus in aligning instructional practice to the Danielson Framework and Common Core 
Learning Standards (CCLS). The staff will participate in professional training and staff development, during and after 
school hours. Teachers will meet in small curriculum leveled groups to review instructional practices, e.g. literacy, 
mathematics, science and social studies. Teachers in pre-kindergarten through grade 5 also participate in a literacy-
based literacy staff development. The program based its training on the Teacher’s College (Columbia University) 
whole language approach in reading and writing. Feedback from staff indicated that the staff development and 
training provided assisted them in identifying and providing instruction that met student academic needs. We have 
worked diligently to create instructional continuity and expectations across all grade levels and have made positive 
inroads through collaborative planning, supervision and targeted professional development.  

 

Assessments are conducted during the school year to monitor student progress in literacy, mathematics, social 
studies and science. The data obtained from the assessments provided teachers needed information for planning and 
providing differentiation of instructional practice.  

P.S. 140 Manhattan has been identified as a school in good standing. The school has met yearly progress for the last 
two years based on State exam results. ELL and the lowest performing students showed improvement by student 
group on the State English test to other students who scored at the same level last year. However, students with 
special needs did not achieve the same level as students in the former cohort groups in mathematics. TTeachers 
identified at-risk subgroups, i.e. special needs and ELL students, and provided additional support, which included 
mainstreaming, pull-out/push-in support, using technology and implementing research program to support learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
A comprehensive assessment of our academic program was completed using the most current School Snapshot 
Report, QR, MOTP and MOSL data. Our data indicated that although we are making steady increase in ELA, our 
students would need additional support in mathematics. From our results of the QR and teacher ratings, the 
pedagogy is effective. School leaders and staff have worked on curriculum planning, development of performance 
tasks and assessments to monitor student progress. The instructional focus for this year using our data (multiple) to 
develop benchmark goals and plan strategic/targeted small group instruction 

Teachers are provided item analysis of ELA and math state exams to support in development of small group and 
differentiated lessons. With support from coaches/consultants, teachers are using data more frequently to gear 
instruction and determine best teaching practices.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of students in grades K-8, including SWD and ENL students will use the Question Formulation 
technique in content area classrooms and show a gain of at least 4 reading levels as evidenced by running records 
(MOSL).

SIFE, STH). 

Professional learning will take place during Monday PD, focusing 
on student engagement and instruction aligned to the CCLS. It 
will also focus on Question Formulation Technique. 
Differentiated professional development workshops will address 
individual teacher need. With support from coaches/consultants, 
teachers will use data more frequently to determine next steps 
and adjustments to lesson plans or curriculum maps. 

Targeted professional development that develop strategies to 
address the needs of students with disabilities, ELL, and other 
high-need student subgroups. Common grade meetings will be 
utilized to monitor implementation of data recording and 
differentiation. Use of DOE resources, such as, Reading with 
Power and Passion.  

Engaging families and supporting their understanding of Rigorous 
instruction and the CCLS in order to support their children at 
home (Family nights, classroom observations). Providing specific 
literacy strategy workshops parents can do at home during

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As indicated in the 2017/2018 QR, M140 received a well-developed in in leveraging resources and monitoring and 
revising systems and proficient in all other categories. Based on State exam results, ELL and special needs cohorts, 
made some progress, but not enough to close the achievement gap. In order to meet the goal required to close the 
achievement gap, additional use of data and professional development are required to meet the needs of the lowest 
performing students.  

In June, 2018, teachers collaborated and developed a year-long curriculum map in content areas. In house coaches 
are supporting teachers in ELA and mathematics instruction. 

Test scores show a slow gradual increase in ELA (last three years), supporting our evidence in the use of Socratic 
Seminar techniques and writing strategies. Overall math scores have been inconsistent in the last three years, with 
exception of Grade 6. Teacher's program includes math coaching opportunities. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will use daily assessments and use of data to allow them to diagnose areas of 
understanding and misconceptions to adjust instruction to meet the needs of all students and ensure mastery as 
evidenced by an increase in Danielson ratings 1a, 1e, 3c, 3d, and 4e.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The creation of Trend Tracking Sheets to assess student work and 
understanding. There will be opportunities in teachers' schedule 
to meet as a cohort to review student work and data. to 
determine next steps.Professional development will be provided 
to discern, measure and evaluate student trends. The curriculum 
maps will be adjusted based on data analysis and student 
mastery. 

Subgroup data will be analyzed to address students’ needs and 
strengths to effectively plan next steps, especially with ELL and 
special need student cohorts. Teachers will develop lesson plans 
that include multiple entry points (differentiated text, visuals, 
manipulatives, etc)

nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

. As indicated in the Learning Environment Survey, 22% of teachers feel their professional development should be 
more focused and sustained. According to the Chancellor’s Four Pillars, professional development will be a 
collaborative and integral part of the entire faculty. Teachers will work with consultants and teacher development 
coach. 

. Professional development in the school has focused on the Chancellor's Initiatives, Danielson Framework and our 
Instruction Focus.  

. Instructional Focus: Involving teachers' feedback about their practice so that they become more reflective about 
their instructional choices. Expanding the role of student talk so that students in all classrooms practice higher-order 
thinking and access CCLS.  

. According to the Learning Environment Survey, 86% of teachers work together as teams. This is evidenced by the 
number of teachers who facilitated workshops during the school year. Our goal is to increase the number of teachers 
who will facilitate workshops during weekly professional development. Our priority needs to achieve this goal will 
include:  

. Development of a Professional Learning Team across all grades in ELA and math 

. To Develop a yearly Professional Development Calendar of workshops and team meetings focused in ELA and math 

. To empower teachers to participate as facilitators in in-house professional development 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 30% increase in the number of teachers (currently 10) who take on leadership roles to 
facilitate workshops, planning sessions, and "in-house" labsites as evidenced by component 4e in Advance.

Section 6: Academic Intervention Services (AIS)  

(Required for All Schools) 

  

Directions: Schools need to maintain accurate records of students who are receiving Academic Intervention Services 
(AIS) to ensure that students who are not achieving proficiency receive effective and timely assistance. These records 
need to be made available upon request and indicate the total number of students receiving AIS in each subject area 
listed below and for each applicable grade in your school. 
 

Type of Academic 
Intervention 
Service (AIS) 

English Language 
Arts (ELA) 

Criteria for 
determining AIS 
services (For 
additional guidance, 
refer to NYSED’s 
memo.) 
To ensure students 
who need AIS 
services, we use the 
“cut-off” scale score 
for ELA in grades 3-
8, as per NYC DOE 
and NYSED 
guidelines. In K-8 we 
use TC assessment 
tools, student 
portfolios and 
teacher feedback  

 

When the service is 
provided (e.g. 
during the school 
day, before or after 
school, etc.) 

Service is rendered 
daily during the 
school day and after 
school twice a week  

 

Type of program or 
strategy (e.g. repeated 
readings, interactive 
writings, etc.) 

Method for delivery 
of service (e.g. small 
group, one-to-one, 
tutoring, etc.) 

Small group is 
provided daily 
during guided 
reading lessons in 
all classes and as 
needed per lesson 
through one-to-one 
if necessary. ICT 
provide parallel 
teaching to ensure 
all students’ needs 
are met. AIS 
assistance requires 
support staff 
teachers, e.g. SETSS, 
ELL to push into the 
classrooms to 
provide additional 
literacy support  

 

Teachers use of TC units 
of study in K-8. Teachers 
also utilize Close Reading 
strategies, annotating the 
text, and using text-based 
evidence questioning. 
Students work in Triads 
(interactive) looking for 
text-based evidence 
related to essential 
questions designed to 
promote critical-thinking. 

 

Teacher explicit modeling 
in literacy/writing is 
incorporated daily 
providing additional 
support to students in 
activities that foster 
independence and 
differentiation of 
instructional practice.  

After school programs 
are also available for at-
risk ELL, special needs 
and general education 
students.  

Teachers volunteer their 
preparation and lunch 
periods to work with 
students who need 
additional support in 
literacy.

Peer tutoring allows for 
students who excel in

Full curriculum 
components of the 
ENVISION Mathematics 
Program are being 
implemented in grades K-
8 and to provide group

Our ICT/SETTS staff have 
been programmed to 
work in parallel with 
classroom teachers to 
support our efforts to 
provide mathematics 
enrichment and 
remediation to students 
in all grade levels.  

 
CCLS aligned science 
activities and 
instructional practices, 
plus additional materials 
for hands-on activities 
are used by science 
teachers during the 
school year. Teachers 
incorporate the same 
Close Reading strategies 
as classroom teachers. 
Materials such as: 
National Geographic, 
Weekly News, 
Discovery.com, Learning 
A-Z and a variety of 
websites are used as 

To ensure students 
who need AIS 
services receive 
support, we use the 
“cut-off” score for 
Mathematics in 
grades 3-8, as per 
the NYC DOE and 
NYSED guidelines. In 
grades K-2, we use 
baseline measures 
of assessment 
provided in MoSL 
and the ENVISION 
Mathematics 
Program, student 
portfolios and 
teacher feedback.  

 

We have two 
science cluster 
teachers who 
service students in 
the school, e.g. 
Cluster 1 – K-6; 
Cluster 2 - grades 7-
8. During the school 
year both teachers 
meet to discuss 
continuity of science 
instruction school 
wide and to create 
tried tasks aligned to 
the CCLS as a means 
of maintaining a

Service is provided 
during a designated 
math block of time, 
which is a minimum 
of 80-90 minutes of 
focused daily 
mathematics 
instruction and 
support. Teachers 
make use of SMART 
Boards, computer 
pods and the 
technology 
laboratory to 
augment 
mathematics 
enrichment and 
remediation.  

 

Service is provided 
weekly during the 
school day.  

 

The mathematics 
workshop model (5 
practicesof 
discourse) is used 
daily: teacher 
model, partner-triad 
work /independent 
work. Teachers 
meet with at-risk 
students in small 
groups (4-5) and 
one-to-one when 
necessary  

 

Science teachers 
use whole class and 
small group 
instruction to 
ensure students are 
able to comprehend 
the scope of science 
material presented 
and can analyze and 
discuss science 
concepts among 
their peers.

We currently have one pre-kindergarten program with a maximum of 18 students. To ensure continuity from pre-k to 
kindergarten, the pre-k teacher collaborates with the kindergarten teacher to familiarize themselves with the CCLS 
Standards for incoming kindergarten students. Professional development is provided by the lead teachers, 
consultants, and teacher development coach during the school year. Both the pre-k and kindergarten teachers work 
closely with CBO’s to facilitate the transition of students between grade levels. Families are invited to attend parental 
orientation sessions to provide edification regarding curriculum, expectations and support structures for families and 
students. In September, during Back to School Night, parents meet with teachers in pre-k and kindergarten to answer 
questions and provide additional guidance to parents about our Early Childhood Program.

. Planning sessions with the staff on and across grade levels in June and September and throughout the school year 
allow for open dialogue and time to review materials by the staff.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 140, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 140: will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on 
the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase 
and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent-
Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional 
development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will 
provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will 
work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also 
maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

          PS 140 implemented a Title III  Enrichment Program for 23(Grades 3 - 8) Ell students 
needing further language development, reading and writing practice,  and math practice.  This 
program is an enrichment program where activities are inquiry based and differentiated, 
supported learning.  The teacher who will be facilitating the program will be the ENL 
teacher,  Ming Liang (ESL certified K - 12) and Common Branch Certified.  The language of 
instruction will be in English.   There will be one Title III enrichment program.  It will be taught 
by one fully certified ENL teacher, Ming Liang.  The criteria we used to select the ENL students 
for the Title III program based on the number of years they have been receiving Ell service, their 
progress and needs according to classroom assessment and teacher observation,  as well as test 
item analysis. This includes students who are newcomers, SIFE, Developing, and Long-Term 
Ells.   Other ENL students on advance level also get invited to join the program.  We are using 
their baseline, ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT test and RLAT results as well as classroom 
performances when determining their needs for the school year of 2018 – 2019.  As for the 
students who are in grades 3 who have only taken the NYSESLAT test, we look at their 
NYSESLAT test results and work progress in their classes, as well as the classroom baseline 
assessment from September 2018.  Meeting were held and choices were offered to parents of all 
ENL students regarding to next year's Title III program.   Due to the many enrichment programs 
in PS 140 extending their their invitations to the ENL students, we only received 23 responses 
from our ENL parents. 
         A focus will be made in literacy instruction, with a concentration on reading and writing, as 
well as math enrichment.  The goal of the Title III funded program is to provide students a wider 
range of opportunities to practice the English language and mathematical skill in a smaller group 
setting after school hours through individual practice, collaborative practice, and theater work 
where students will write their own scripts and perform their final products to the audiences. 
Parents will be invited to the Title III after school show at the end of the year.  This program 
provides enrichment,  the opportunities for individual practice, inquiry based on interest and 
group activities. 
         The Title III program will include Ells from the  Elementary and Middle School 
levels.   The ELLs will meet on Wednesday, Thursday from 2:30PM - 5:00 PM.  The program 
will be scheduled such as Wednesday for Elementary level, 2:30 - 5:00,  and Thursday will 
be for Middle School level, 2:30 - 5:00 PM. The Title III program will be serviced by a dully 
licensed ENL teacher.  The session begins October 2018 and last till June of 2019.  As of June, 
letters and phone calls have been send out and made to families.   As of October we only 
received confirmation from 23 of the parents as of this moment.  We received confirmation from 
12 elementary, 2 six grades, 6 seven grades, and 3 eighth graders, a total of 23 students.  The 
program will meet 5 hours per week, two and half hours per session, two times a week for 30 
weeks for a total of 74 sessions.  After reviewing the data with the classroom teachers and the 
content area teachers, according to the standardized test results of the Ells for school year 2017 -

2018, has proved that this structure is effective in support of the Ells' needs.  This schedule arise 
per the request of the parents and students to receive extra support and practice.  This format has 
increased student participation as well as their learning progress. The ENL teacher will meet 
with the grade teachers and communicate daily by Google Doc regards to students needs and the 
curriculum, as well as lessons planning. The ENL teacher and the classroom teachers will meet 
after school weekly to discuss targeted needs and discovery regards to student progress. 
        The elementary students will have specifically assigned assignment based on their 
assessments through interactive software program that we purchased to target their needs for the 
first hour.  Then the teachers will focus on the math for the second hour.  The students will have 
choices for an activity to explore either by themselves of with partnership. 
        As for the middle school level, the teacher conducts small group instruction with a targeted 
focus, the expanding students will participate with partnership or in group to research, to inquire 
and to experiment.  Each of the students will have a work station  to work on their assigned 
enrichment task for Math or ELA for individual practice, while the teacher zoom into specific 
needs in small groups.  When the teacher finishes her guided teaching with the small group, then 
the Middle school students go on the work stations to practice their individualized target 
skills.  For reading, we will use RAZ-Kids on line e-reader.  This program targets the students' 
specific deficiencies and  promote higher level thinking and reading.   For math hour, we will use 
Pearson Math(this program will target middle school math skills) to bridge the gap. We will have 
hands on activities to promote mathematical skills.  We will also take walking trips to the 
supermarket to learn number sense and money sense.  The middle school students will also 
create word problems based on their walking trip and hands on project based on their 
experiences.  
           For Direct/Guided English instruction, the students will be grouped according to their 
proficiency in English. Some of the Title III activities include interactive reading, listening, 
social language development and linguistic development, as well as independent reading while 
teacher conducts guided reading.  The students will also be using technology during the Title III 
program to enhance their listening, reading comprehension as well as practicing their critical and 
higher order thinking skills.  The students will be provided with laptop stations.   The Title III 
program will be using interactive programs such as:ABCYA.Match, Reading Rabbit, Cool Math, 
RAZ-Kids(for individualized support for reading and math) and READWORK(for close reading) 
to provide additional supports. The teacher will conduct small group instructions while other 
students participate in lessons on interactive software and Smartboard. 
            As for the supplies needed for our Title III activities, we will use 10% of the Title III 
fund to purchase the materials which amount to $1,236.60.  We will purchase art supplies for 
students to create the stage for the final performance, math activities, book making materials, 
paint, blank booklets, chart paper for script writing, ink for printing the script, and printing paper 
to print the final script, as well as materials to conduct experiments.  Materials such as poster 
paper, markers and glue, white paper and ink will be purchased for the students use, for they will 
create mini projects using the Title III funds.  In addition, we will also purchase ebooks, RAZ-
KId reading program, Math interactive program using other funding. All of these interactive 
program will target the student's individual needs and conduct assessment based on their 
individual levels.  We will also purchase Learning A - Z for writing to provide students' the 
opportunities to apply their academic language in writing.  The students will also conduct in 
hands on activities where they are in needs of these items.  The students will also participate in 
hands on science experiments through the program. 
           As for the Math instruction, the students are grouped according to their needs and grade 
levels.  The teacher conducts mini group instructions for both Elementary level on 
Wednesday,  and Middle School students for Thursday.  The teacher will create enrichment 
activities to help support the ENL and help build a stronger foundation.  To help the students 
with special needs and in need of extra supports, the teacher uses manipulative to help students

visually see the model and objects in question. The students get to see, touch, and build to bring 
the information alive to better comprehend the content. The teacher will also use the computer 
software as another resource to enhance the students’ mathematical skills on the interactive 
Smartboard. The students will work together to build their final product using mathematical 
skills and knowledge, then present it to the class. 
Elementary School Group:  3rd grade – 4(1-emerging, 2-newcomers,1 - expanding ), 4th grade – 
4(2 Transitional, 1 SIFE, 1 - newcomer), Fifth grade - 4 (1 newcomers, 3-entering) 
Middle School Group: 6th grade - 2 students ( 2 transitioning), 7th grade -  6 ( 4-Transitional: 2 
SIFE and 2 newcomers, 2- emerging) and 8th grade - 3(2 newcomers, 1-entering) 
Since many of the 3rd and 4th  grade newcomers have interrupted formal education, they will be 
grouped together for math according to their most needed areas as well as for guided reading. 
The  5th will be taught as a small group.  As for the 6th graders, newcomers will be grouped 
together for math and guided reading. The teacher will also conduct read aloud as a group to 
practice reasoning and questioning. The 7th and 8th graders will be grouped together for 
exploration and intervention. 
 The more advance students will be reading buddies and learning buddies for the newcomers, 
entering, emerging and transitional students as a way to develop and build on their English 
Language acquisition skills.

The PD provider, Christina Brown a fully certified ELA teacher will be conducting professional 
development for the ENL teacher as well as with the other teachers in the school.  The 
ELA teacher has been trained and working with an experienced coach with knowledge of ENL 
strategies and experience in supporting special needs students from the network on providing PD 
to teachers of ENL in differentiating instruction and providing scaffolding to meet the ENL 
students' need. The topic will focus on the needs of ELLs as they acquire the English 
language.  The ENL teacher will be a participant in these workshops. The workshops will focus 
on the use of protocol for discussions to guide the ENL students on the discussion, and the 
format of Socratic Seminar in the classrooms to support the ELLs as they acquire academic 
English skills.  These workshops will allow teachers to discuss the needs of the ENL students, 
the multi-entry points in supporting the students to develop their thinking skills, oral skills, and 
develop the students' articulation confidence.  The ELA teacher will work with the teachers to 
create rubrics and protocols to support the ENL students in the class.  The use of Socratic 
Seminar will provide students at different proficiency levels the opportunities to be heard,  every 
student to have a voice, provides teachers with valuable assessment opportunities, and allows 
multiple entry points to accessing complex texts.   The workshops will look at the rationale 
behind Socratic Seminars as well as review the different components that can be used to help 
Socratic Seminars run smoothly.  The PD will provide training on addressing the delivery of 
instruction to different proficiency levels of different subgroups.  Through the Socratic method 
students will strengthen their speaking/listening and higher order thinking skills.  Additionally,

       At the beginning of the school year (SY 2018 - 2019), parental orientation will  take place in 
the auditorium to inform the parents about the opportunities for the Ells to attend the Title III 
after school program.   After school letters will be giving out to parents at this time.  In addition, 
the sessions also will provide insight into the important of parental involvement in the school, 
student assessments, and academic achievement of ELL students.   
      Parent workshops will focus on how parents can assist students in applying their language 
skills at home, and in the community through classroom activities which both the parents and 
students will participate together during after school. The ENL teacher and the Parents' 
coordinator will work together to reach out to the parents to invite them to come and participate 
in parental workshops and after school in class activities. Parents will be invited to come to visit 
the Title III program and participate in the after school activities  such as math games where each 
family is competing with the child's help in winning the game, Read to My mom and Dad where 
the child acts as the teacher and read to his/her parents, and technology fun day.  The costs of 
parental involvement will be taking from other budgets. 
      The workshops will focus on student assessments, social adjustment and special events in the 
school.  The school will provide written translation of all letters forwarded to parents during the 
school year pertaining to student achievement, parental involvement and workshops.  The 
translated services will be provided by the school's ENL teacher and General Ed. teachers in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50

different native languages.  Phone calls will also be make to keep parents updated on all 
activities and changes.  We will also be utilizing the translation service from the translation 
services.  This is a collaboration between the parents' coordinator (Yolanda Saldana)  and the Ell 
teacher (Ming Liang). The parents will also get to watch video and PowerPoint presentation of 
students in action in the classrooms and  finished products of students' work. 
        As part of the workshop, the parents will also get the first - hand experience with active 
learning with technology. They will learn to use the basic function of the computer, visit 
educational web-based program the students are using in school for enrichment and practice, as 
well as visiting parents friendly website for resources help.  The parents of Ells will also learned 
to use search engines to find supports for the ENL students and for the family.  In addition, they 
get to play with the learning activities on the computer and Smartboard. We will have technology 
class on Friday every week. The workshop will focus on the basic skills of operating a computer, 
research, access educational web page, access the student grade books, teacher's web page for the 
student's assignment, as well as interactive learning programs like: XML, ELA Plus, and Math 
programs. 
       In addition, PS 140 will also have  family night where we bring together the parents of 
ENLs to provide them supports every quarter Oct 2018, Dec 2018, Feb 2019, May 2019.  Topics 
will be covered are:  monthly resources based on topics of needs which will help support the 
Ells, twice a month school updates for the Ell parents, and for May - high school 
introduction(supporting the Ells in transition with the high school selection process), application 
process/ website review.  This is a collaboration between Ms. Liang (ENL teacher) and Ms. 
Schaefer (Math Lead teacher).   
      In addition to the workshops conducts by the PTA, we also have activities for the Ell 
parents  throughout the year during parent engagement day.  These parent engagement activities 
targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact higher achievement for Ells will be  once a 
month on Tuesday from 2:25 - 3: 35  The ELL parents will participate in the Leadership ESL 
Parent Class.   The parent engagement activities are at no cost to the Title III program.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The formative assessments the school uses are Fountas and Pinnell, TCRWP, teacher-created assessment, running record and 
reading record, and writing on - demand, are being used to guide instructional planning for the Ells.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures we have in place to support this effort are small group teaching.  The teachers use anchor chart and exemplar 
to model, to support and guide learning.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

The summative assessments the school use are NYC performance Tasks, unit baseline(at the beginning of each unit). The LAP 
team members use the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, Formal and Informal reading record to analyze the students’ progress 
and needs.  The school LAP team reviewed each set of subtest scores from the NYSESLAT, NYSITELLand Interim assessment 
from last year for weaknesses and strengths before planning the schedules for the year.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have structured our program during this school year where the Elementary school teachers meet during their common 
preps to discuss data to drive instruction at the elementary level, and  the Middle school teachers meet during their common 
preps to discuss data to drive instruction at the Middle school level, as well as  the whole school meet together once a month 
to discuss their finding to drive instruction and needs. We used data gather to inform instruction.  Teachers use guided 
questions to amplify thinking, use data to form heterogeneous grouping, small group activities, guided teaching, and student-
lead discussion.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
             P.S. 140 follows the three tiered model for Response to Intervention (RTI). Teachers create charts to keep track of Tier 
1 services they provide to their students. Teachers keep tracks of behaviors ELL students may exhibit and discuss it with the 
coaches, ENL teacher,  and administrators to identify the needs of the students. Tier 1 instruction includes high quality, 
research-based whole class instruction, delivered by the classroom and intervention  teacher, to meet the needs of 90% of the 
class.  These differentiated lessons delivered in small group. The classroom teacher and ENL teacher work together to analyze 
date from the evaluators and other assessments to create a plan that may include a 9 week cycle of Tier 2 support with regular 
progress monitoring. The ENL teacher utilize the Intervention programs such as Imagine Learning, and Learning A-Z to 
support  and track the students progress .   
       NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and MATH scores, Periodic Assessments designed by classroom teachers, Guided Reading Running 
Records are used to provide intervention in a general education setting for students in P.S. 140 Manhattan.  Teachers meet 
periodically to discuss student progress and modify approaches of instruction for students in need of interventions that will 
help augment their academic success, without having to refer students to the IEP Team for a special education referral.  The 
school uses classroom data to guide instruction within the RTI framework. Small group for Tier2, individualize instruction for 
Tier 3 students and whole class instruction for Tier 1 students. The progress is being monitored by Ell teacher, classroom 
teacher, IEP team, after school support team.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessments data we used to evaluated and inform our Ell programs are the students' progress toward 
achievement of proficiency for specific subgroups of ells in NYSESLAT, ELA, and MATH.  The factors that can be analyzed 
include home language, grade level, years of ELL service, ELA/math performance and progress, NYSESLAT proficiency and 
progress, attendance, age, holdover status, SIFE status, and disability classification. We use the EDAT to  create custom 
categories. The Early Warning (At-Risk) Indicator feature automatically calculates the number of risk factors exhibited and 
color-codes them accordingly.   Furthermore, we use the data to (1) identify trends/pockets of success, and (2) investigate the 
instructional and programmatic differences between groups of students who consistently progress toward proficiency and 
those who do not. Best practices can be identified, documented and shared across schools.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

All teachers meet and discuss during their common preps  and share observation, data analysis, and notes.  Also, teachers 
share through Google doc to update on the students' progress to make adjustments of teaching strategies and programs.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ENL program at PS 140 provides instruction in English.    The instruction is taught through integrating Social 
Studies with ENL.  The students are group heterogeneously across 2 grade levels in the elementary schools and group 
across three grade level in the Middle School.  The instruction is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  Ms.Liang 
collaborates with the classroom teacher and the middle school content area teachers to create curriculum plan that 
align with the Common Core Standards and the contents. In addition to servicing the students as a class, Ms. Liang 
also services newcomers with Entering and Emerging proficiency in a smaller setting to promote oral, listen, and 
speaking skills.   The  teacher is using a curriculum developed with the content area teachers where the ENL teacher 
teaches  Social Studies, Science, ELA through literacy using ENL strategies.  Language development activities are built 
within every unit while the students are learning the contents and strategies/techniques to access the contents in the 
ENL program.  The ENL teacher is teaching Social Studies and Science through literacy where content area language 
and academic vocabulary are a focus.  The students are required to complete writing performance tasks at the ends of 
the unit and also presentation to show mastering of content.   The students are being grouped mixed grade, and 
mixed levels.  There are 59 students ranging from grades 1 -8 currently in attendances.   The Ells attend all science and 
other programs with their classes during the day.  The amount of mandated daily instruction is based on Entering (360 
minutes of service per week), Emerging (360 minutes of service per week), Transitioning(180 minutes of service per 
week) and Expanding (180 minutes per week). Students are grouped by grade levels and proficiency.    Also, the 
commanding students will also receive 90 minutes of support services per week.  The program is organized by the 
student’s proficiency level such as Entering and Emerging for 360 minutes of service where language development is 
built within the lessons, while the Transitional, Expanding  level for 180 minutes of service with the Commanding 
students.   The students are group by proficiency levels and mixed grades with no more than three cross grade 
levels.  Furthermore, the ENL students are challenged to meet or exceed the performance standards with content 
area project themed units, and writing performance task to be grade with rubrics.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We have no TBE program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We have no DL program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The teacher and administrators reviewed the Part 154-2 Unit of Study and requirement for the ENL program.  As per CR Part 
154,  the Entering and Emerging, 360 minutes of instruction is provided, the Transitional and Expanding are receiving 180 
minutes of integrated instruction, and the commanding students receive 90 minutes per week for two years.    The school 
reviews the result of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, ELA, Math along with the ENL schedule to assure that the mandated number 
of minutes is provided in explicit ENL, explicit ELA, and content area instruction.  Administrative staff creates student schedules 
following Part 100 SED requirement are met.  To meet the needs of the students, the ENL teacher works with the classwork 
teachers in developing unit plans that integrate the content area of studies with the students language goals in mind.  The ENL 
teacher will teach social studies through literacy, science through literacy with language objectives for the ELL students 
included in the program.  The teacher will provide differentiation to each lessons to enrich the students' learning and to bridge 
the gap of knowledge.  Lessons will include interactive learning, hands-on activities, visual, and anchor media to reach all 
students.  The ENL. teacher works collaboratively with the ELA teachers at the Middle School level as well as the classroom 
teachers.  The teachers meet during lunch and after school to plan and discuss the need of the students to maximize English 
language acquisition for Ells. The classroom teachers articulate with the ENL teachers and Plan interventions that will augment

the literacy instruction provided in the classroom.  The ENL teacher and the general and/or special needs teachers meet 
periodically to review Ell student progress and discuss instructional strategies that can be used to improve the Ell students’ 
acquisition of language arts skills.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All instruction in the content area is  delivered by the ENL teacher in the ENL program through a balanced approach to 
promote social development and academic learning. All instruction is taught in English.  The teacher integrate science, social 
studies and literacy units within the curriculum.  Students are taught content specific vocabulary.   The teacher includes 
activities to promote English language proficiency and help develop content knowledge in Social Studies and 
Science.  Activities such as Closed - Reading  of complex text, Think-Pair-Share, Shared Reading, Socratic Seminars,Student -
lead discussions to support students and help students build schema, build background knowledge to promote learning.  The 
methods the teacher uses to make content comprehensible are videos, photographs, historical documents, graphic organizers, 
anchor charts, partnerships, Visual Thinking Strategies using primary sources to provide supports within the classroom.       
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We have only freestanding ENL program. However, native language support is available in the classroom and ENL 
class.  Student work will be used to evaluate the students' reading and writing ability for instructional purpose.  The teachers 
will use the data she collected from the students to plan and differentiate instruction according to individual need.  The 
teacher will create an academic portfolio for the students. The teacher will collect a variety of written pieces from the students 
and assess them on their progress.  Work written in their home languages will be reviewed by the teachers collaboratively to 
identify needs and growth.   The Gen -ed teachers create assignments that are related to the content to test the students in 
their understanding of the content knowledge during each unit.   In September, the newcomers are given the Spanish LAB to 
evaluate the students' knowledge in their home languages.  Students are also given a baseline writing throughout the year to 
track progress. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

activities, guided lessons, and use technology with differentiated instruction using software. The different ways we support the 
SIFE in the ENL program and in the classroom are by pairing them with students who speak their native language, include 
visuals, such as videos, illustrations, maps, charts, word walls, word banks, graphic organizers to support daily instruction. 
 
5b:  For Newcomers, we as a school act as a support system for these students.  The rooms are labeled with pictures.  The 
students are paired with reading and writing partners, participate in small group work, academic conversations among peers, 
and with modified assignments for independent learning.  The teacher tailors the instruction to meet the students' needs 
during one to one teaching, model teaching, and guided practice.  In addition, the teacher also creates a print rich 
environment , content vocabulary word wall with visuals, and provide opportunities to develop the Newcomers content area 
vocabulary. 
 
5c: For Developing Ells, opportunities in working in groups to develop their cognitive and metacognitive skills, as well as their 
oral, and auditory skills.  Teacher also conduct small group teaching, guided reading groups, collaborative learning among 
peers to develop the students' vocabulary and academic knowledge. 
 
5d:  For Long Term Ells, Opportunities in working in groups are also provided to develop their cognitive and metacognitive

skills.  Teachers form smaller groups based on their learning progress to differentiate instruction through guided reading and 
writing, as well as collaborative group activities to promote higher order thinking. 
 
5e:   For the Former Ells, the ENL teacher provides 90 minutes of service per week for 2 years.  All instruction will be provided 
with visual support, integrate the students into groups with monolingual students.  The teacher also provide small group 
support as well as guided teaching to continue supporting the Former Ells.  For the Former Ells, they have the opportunities to 
work in different groups to learn from the other peers, and to support Ell peers.  The teacher forms smaller groups for guided 
reading, writing, and for more advance teaching.   
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional strategies and grade -level  materials the teachers of Ell-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English language development are:  manipulative for math, interactive games in math and 
science, primary sources and videos in Social Studies, hands on activities, group collaboration to support the Ell-SWDS.  The 
classroom teachers also use IXL to support students in ELA, Math, and Science.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
To support the Ell-SWDS to achieve their IEP goals and attain their English proficiency within the least restrictive environment, 
the ENL teachers working closely with the classroom teachers to review the students' IEP and students' needs before 
scheduling the students.  All students with special needs are scheduled to be served according to their mandates and IEP 
goals.  Also, the ENL teacher articulate with all the service providers, and classroom teachers weekly to identify needs and 
progress, as well as to set and adjust their instructional program.   In addition, teachers  meet once a year to modify  their 
instructional programs based on their progress for the year and reset goals for next year.  The Ell-SWDS are group with the 
mainstream students for ENL services.  All teachers use  various strategies to differentiate instructions for the ELL-SWDS to 
support them in meeting their goals.  The teachers use the same strategies but use multiple entries to help close the gape in 
the content area.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention programs we have for Ells in ELA are Reading Partners of N.Y. AIS program supported by the SETSS's 
teacher in providing AIS service to the Special needs Ell,  and the librarian certified in reading intervention.  As for Math, the 
teacher uses small group during prep to teach the students.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data and trends, the math lead teacher will work with our teachers to improve pedagogy and math 
understanding.  The lead teacher attends training and workshop provided by the DOE.  The math lead teacher will bring 
differentiated learning strategies into the classrooms. The lead teacher goes into each classroom to observe teaching and 
model teaching using strategies.  The literacy consultant observes and models in classrooms using differentiated 
strategies.  The consultant then work with the teachers in the school.  The literacy coach models in house to improve 
pedagogical teaching skills.  The curriculum team will discuss support and needs to support the teachers. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have a bilingual program in PS 140. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The Ells have equal access to all school programs. The after school and supplemental services offered to Ells in PS 140 are: The 
Poetry Slam Club, Latin Dance class, Music Instrumental class, Regent Prep for Science, Drama Club, Art club, Photography

permission slips are send home with the students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials the teachers used in PS 140 to support the Ells in all proficiency levels include IXL, Raz-Kids, E-
books, Documentary/Films, picture books, Videos, photographs to support the content areas. For the Newcomers teachers use 
educational sites such as abcya, abcmouse, starfalls to support the students in developing their phonic awareness, 
fundamental skills, bridging the gap of formal education, and to promote oral language. The ENL teacher and the classroom 
teachers are utilizing the Read aloud and projectable books to visually connect the spoken words and written words with the 
Newcomers, and developing Ells. The ENL teacher also utilizing the e-books to introduce complex texts with the Expanding 
students to introduce the Ells to higher level vocabulary as well as content based vocabulary.  Ell students on all proficiency 
levels have their individual Reading A-Z account where the reading program keep track of their reading assessments and 
promote their reading level as they master each reading level and strategies.  The reading program pushes the Ells and 
highlight their strength and support their needs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The ENL program provide  support to the Ells by providing the Ells with bilingual dictionary, vocabulary banks in the content 
area with visual.  The ENL teacher accepts writing from Newcomers in their native languages to assess their understanding of 
the topic taught, content, and strength of their native language.  Using the data collected, the ENL teacher then plan 
instruction based on the data to help students build a stronger foundation in the new language, and start building learning on 
their levels. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to the Ells' ages and grade levels by assessing the 
students with a benchmark at the beginning of the school year, analyzing the data from the NYSESLAT modality, writing on 
demand at the beginning of each unit to measure the strength and weakness of the students.  The teachers then use the data 
from the data collections to select age, grade levels, and on level reading materials that is appropriate for their students to be 
included in their everyday learning. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school do not share a building with the other school.  Our school goes from Pre-K to 8th grade. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Every June, the ENL teacher and the six grade teachers host an incoming student orientation for the six graders.  The school 
also offer student -lead school tour.  The parents and new students also get to view video of school activities of the former and 
current students.  The teachers design student-lead group activities with the current six grade students to foster interactions 
with the newly enrolled students. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We have no language elective in our school. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Profession development for all Ell personnel at the school is presented by our coaches, experts who are involved with staff 
development, and workshops offers by the DELLS.  The teachers of Ells are offered  the opportunities to attend PDs that 
address differentiation, reading complex text, data analysis, and multiple entries to support contents for Ell-SWD students.  In 
addition, the non-pedagogic staff also participate in-house PD in address the needs of the Ells.   Teachers will be provided 
professional development from the MFSC.  Teachers will also participate in Monday PDs around differentiation, scaffolds, and 
developing lessons aligned to Common Core Learning Standards. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include

development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher at PS 140 schedules individual meeting before school, during her preps, and after school in September to 
discuss goals of the program, language development progress from the NYSESLAT assessment and proficiency results, as well 
as language development needs in all content areas.  Individual meeting will be conduct  throughout the year to keep parents 
inform of their children's progress during the school year.  The ENL and content teachers also conduct  phone call meeting 
for  parents who are unable to leave their homes. The school makes provisions for parents by having interpreters present for 
translation to parents who speak another language.  We have multilingual staff in language such as Spanish, Russian, 
Mandarin, Cantonese, Italian, and French speakers in the building.  These meetings are additional meetings in addition to the 
mandated orientation and parent-teacher conference. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The methodologies used in PS 140 to assess language preferences are oral interview, HLS, data generated from 
ATS, and data on Emergency Blue Cards. A review of the ethnic data provided by the NYC DOE generated the 
needed information the written and oral interpretation needs of students and parents in P.S. 140M. An effort has 
been made to provide translation and interpretation services to parents. Bilingual in-house staff has been 
assigned to translate letters, notices and programmatic information deemed necessary for parental edification. 
Bilingual staff also assist in making phone calls to parents based on parental preferences in Spanish, French, 
Chinese, Bengali, ans Arabic. We also use the service from the Dial a Language Line for language service that is not 
available on site as well as use the translated documents from the Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet 
page.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

It is the intent of P.S. 140M to provide the needed translation and interpretation services to parents to enable them 
to be fully engaged and play an active role in the education of their children. The Principal's office create Welcome 
Posters in multi-languages. The school also download the parental guides in multi-languages from the D.O.E website 
and duplicate them for distribution to parents. Extra copies also placed at the reception area visible to the parents as 
they enter the main office for inquiry. The main office staff, the nurse, the classroom teachers and the Ell specialist 
also are available to provide services to parents who need assistance in translation and interpretation services.  

All New York City Department of Education materials which include documents, posters, and other materials which 
have been translated are posted and disseminated to parents if needed. 

All notification documents can be found at the Translation and Interpretation Unit’s intranet site: 
http://intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.  

We will also use the Dial a Language Line service to communicate with parents who have specified oral 
communication in a language that are not available on site. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school will provide the parents the opportunities to provide feedback on the quality and availability of services 
through parental survey, PTA meetings, phone calls, communication between parents and parents' coordinator, as 
well as communication between parents and teachers by letters. We will provide multilingual surveys to parents to 
better communicate with the parents. We will use the translated parent surveys that are available on the intranet 
page.
