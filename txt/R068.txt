Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Vision: 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

We, at The Port Richmond School for Visionary Learning, believe all students will learn regardless of life 
circumstances. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our Mission: 

Through our collective investment, students think critically, demonstrate effective problem solving skills and 
communicate powerfully and compellingly with a wide- range of audiences. As a school community, we celebrate the 
unique gift in each child and support each child to become successful- academically, socially and emotionally- in an 
environment of trust, safety and academic challenge that will prepare each child for the unimagined prospects of 
tomorrow. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our founding staff shares the beliefs and principles of PS 68 and is deeply committed to the success of all students. 
Each year our staff will expand as we welcome new students. In the 2018- 19 school year, we are growing to Pre-
Kindergarten through Second Grade, with approximately 240 students comprised of 48% Hispanic, 28% Black, 12% 
White, 6% Multiracial, 5% Asian and 1% American Indian.  

 

The Port Richmond School for Visionary Learning is located in a former communications company central office and 
has been redesigned into an state-of-the-art facility with spacious learning places and natural lighting. Prior to the 
opening, the Office of School Design (OSD) partnered with families, district and community stakeholders to develop 
PS 68. The decision was informed by and responsive to family, community and district needs. Working in close 
collaboration with the superintendent and the new school leader, OSD convened interactive meetings and visioning 
activities to ensure multiple voices and ideas are represented from throughout the district to inform the design and 
leadership of PS 68. By 2022, we will serve approximately 450 Kindergarten through grade 5 students in Port 
Richmond, Staten Island. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have one self- contained Special Education class of 12:1:1 serving kindergarten through 2nd grade students who 
have been classified as , speech- impaired, learning disabled (LD) or emotionally disturbed (ED). We currently have 12 
ELLs and 9 former ELLs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In our inaugural year, we focused on creating a Supportive Environment and Strong Family- Community Ties. We have 
been able to benchmark our proficiencies in these areas with the Learning Environment Survey and parent- 
engagement participation tracker. Additionally, we have begun to forge partnerships with community- based 
organizations, faith-based organizations, colleges and other local schools. These partnerships support us in facilitating 
community dialogues and relationships. In the 2017- 2018 school year, we will focus on the same components of the 
FGS adding with intention by training teachers and staff in TCIS, social- emotional learning and responsive classroom 
practices including resources and strategies. We will continue to build family relationships through positive and 
diverse interactions via academic workshops, social- emotional training, partnerships. 

  Wagner College Port Richmond Partnership-The mission of the Port Richmond Partnership is to encourage 

sustainable relationships among members of the Port Richmond and Wagner College communities to 
enhance student learning and raise civic awareness, while also supporting collaborations that address 
significant challenges and establish measurable impacts in five high need areas: arts, education, health, 
economic development and immigration.

risk for future substance abuse problems due to their current negative behaviors. The YMCA offers 
Community Education program offers a variety of services, including visual displays, literature distribution, 
and speakers at family events. 

  Reach Out and Touch Ministries- Our faith-based community partner supports our families with matching and 

accessing community resources as well as building a positive future for adults and students. They provide 
information,resources, training, community events, and professional learning to staff, families and children. 

In 2018- 2019, we will focus on Collaborative Teachers and Rigorous Instruction, as evidenced through observation/ 
feedback data teachers and instructional staff are in need of improvement in delivering CCLS- aligned pedagogy. 
Through professional learning cycles and developing Impact Team protocol practices, teachers will increase in 
proficiency of practice, particularly in mathematics.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
K-2 Students take ELA and Mathematics Assessments three times in the school year to measure and information 
about what students have learned. Teachers use these assessments, along with other school work and what they see 
in class, to learn where students need more help and plan targeted instruction. 
 
All entering kindergarten students were screened in reading, writing and mathematics skill attainment at registration. 

Between mid September and early October all K-2 students are screened in literacy and mathematics using 
prerequisite formative assessments. 

1.  Assessments provide schools with up-to-date information about what each student knows and can do so that 

teachers can target instruction to the learning needs of every child. 

2.  Assessments predict students' performance on New York State Tests so that teachers can help every student 

meet or exceed State Learning Standards. 

3.  Assessments measure student learning within a grade and from grade-to-grade to help schools keep students 

on track for success in high school and beyond. 

4.  Results will be shared with families at curriculum events and in communication about progress. 

According to June 2018 data, 75% of students demonstrated proficiency in ELA traits overall as measured by the NYC 
Performance Tasks. 

According to June 2018 data, 35% of students demonstrated proficiency in Mathematics traits overall as measured by 
NYC Performance Tasks. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 85% of students, including SWDs and ELLs will demonstrate grade- appropriate CCLS Reading 
Foundational Standards as evidenced on end of year TCRWP running records. 75% of students, including SWDs and ELLs

*Family engagement events are scheduled monthly to bring family members into our classrooms to explore what 
learning looks like and sounds like. Students take on the role of the teacher and model for family members. The 
events are called "First Friday Family Fun" and occur immediately following the start of the school day. After the in- 
class portion of the event, family members are invited to a workshop to learn parenting tips and homework help. 

 

* Our partner, the YMCA conducts a 6 session parent workshop using the program Parenting Wisely. Participants 
receive hands-on experience through role-play and scenarios. Each receives a binder filled with activities to apply at 
home.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Following the first year, Advance- eligible teachers scored an average on 2.3, 0.2 below the effective range. 
Additionally, one out of four Advance- ineligible teachers was rated unsatisfactory in pedagogy and practice. As a 
result of Measures of Teaching Practice observation/ feedback cycle, ratings suggest teachers need to focus 
development on Domain II of the Danielson Framework. The first cycle of professional development was aligned to 
support teachers' practice in managing student behavior and setting up the classroom environment to foster a culture 
of learning. Final ratings will not be delivered until September 2017 that include Measures of Student Learning. 
Furthermore, as new and growing school, new teachers join the team who have not been evaluated by the same 
admin team. Evaluation ratings are unnormed. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 85% of teachers will demonstrate effective practices in teacher clarity as evidenced in feedback received 
through observation/ feedback/ professional learning cycles (Danielson Framework components 1E and 3C).

norm expectations for teaching strategies (including 
questioning, scaffolds in English and/or native language 
where appropriate, and routines,) consistently provide 
multiple entry points into the curricula so that all 
learners, including ELLs and SWDs, are engaged in 
appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-
order thinking skills in student work products as 
evidenced in unit plans.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 68, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 68 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child's progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

The school's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school's Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The school's policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. P.S. 68 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child's progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community; 

The school's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school's Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school's Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school's 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school's Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents' capacity to help their children at home; 

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school's Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school's educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 68  uses benchmark assessments at the beginning of the year.  We also utilize the NYC DOE Performance Tasks for Reading 
and Writing as well as TCRWP assessment system.   We do these assessments throughout the year.  They provide us with the 
following information:  letter/sound identification, word recognition, early book handling skills and instructional/independent 
reading levels.  In addition, running records are evaluated to determine the type of miscues a students in making to make 
instructional decisions.  In writing students are assessed through on demand writing assessments utilizing rubrics that reflect 
the Common Core Learning Standards.  All of this data allows the teachers to form small groups to provide differentiated 
instruction according to the students' individual needs. This information is also shared with the ENL teacher so that she might 
focus on key areas of weakness during her small group instruction.  In conjunction with  TCRWP scores, the ENL teacher 
carefully examines NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores when planning her instruction as well.  Instructional planning for ELLs is also 
guided by the students' work, such as graphic organizers, teacher-created assessments, student writing samples.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support this effort, we have Grade Team Meetings, benchmark conversations, and benchmark assessment data 
collections. Grade Team Meetings are teacher teams that follow various protocols to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching 
strategies as well as support teachers with pedagogy.   Grade Team Meetings allow the opportunity to discuss individualized 
student work, progress, and strategies.  They meet weekly to analyze student work and plan for individual and groups of 
students to provide remediation or enrichment to students based on their needs. In addition, administration meets once a 
week as well with the teachers to analyze data and support them with adjusting instruction to meet the needs of individual 
and groups of students. Administration also collects the aforementioned data during benchmark times of year (November, 
January, March) to analyze strengths, needs and progress to support groupings of students for intervention. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 PS 68 believes in a holistic approach of evaluating our program in order to support students. We are committed to excellence 
and understand that we must grow and change every year to meet the changing needs and challenges of our students. Both 
formal and informal venues are explored including report cards, NYSESLAT, Reading Benchmark Assessments, teacher created 
tests, on demand writing pieces, teacher and parent interviews,  and needs based surveys to determine the success of our ELL 
programs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, we address the different needs of academic intervention.  Teachers discuss the 
summative data at the weekly Grade Team Meetings to make adjustments to curricula or small group plans to promote 
student achievement. Benchmark data collection allows administration and the staff to look at data on a wider scale to adjust 
intervention plans.  Each childs' performance is addressed and evaluated individually and appropriate interventions are put in 
place to address the students' need.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 68 utilizes TCRWP assessments along with classroom based assessments and formative checklists to identify students in 
need of RTI. In addition, the universal screening process for ELLs (NYSITELL) is also closely examined. Based on need, the school 
implements a hybrid reading/writing curriculum aligned with TC and Leveled Literacy Intervention programs, and continually 
charts student progress to guide instruction.  The progress of these students is checked by interim assessments. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
PS 68 is a new school in its' second year, serving Pre-Kindergarten through first grade. Since its inception we have tested 
students with the NYSITELL and the Spanish LAB-R when appropriate, and recently with the NYSESLAT.  We have not yet tested 
our students with the NYS ELA and Math.  The data of the NYSITELL was evaluated and found to reveal that the ELLs were 
strongest in the speaking and listening modalities.  As such, the ELL program was designed to coordinate and support the 
reading and writing components of the ELLs classroom as well as other subject areas.  The results of the NYSITELL exam were 
also used when programming the ELLs.  The results of the NYSITELL yielded that the incoming ELLs have varying strengths in 
each modality. As such, the programming for the ELLs in the ENL program allowed for grouping of ELLs according to modality 
strength/need/support.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
ELL programming is discussed periodically as a need for changes becomes apparent.  The grouping of ELLs is assessed 
continuously by the ENL teacher in order to appropriately place and support the ELL.  The ENL teacher is advised by the 
classroom teacher and after each weekly Grade Team Meeting about any changes or support needed in the ELLs programming, 
as well.  Administrative and staff weekly meetings often include similar conversation as the ELLs academic progress or areas of 
difficulties ensue.  In addition, we share ELL information via the Google drive to ensure teacher and support staff input on 
making curricular and programming decisions. All teachers and service providers are provided with all data findings.  They then 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

take these findings and design curricular and programming adjustments accordingly and strategically as they are planned and 
aligned to the standards and also targets the students' need. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS 68 the ENL program uses an integrated program.  Based on the levels determined by the NYSITELL, and the 
NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher creates a program to support the students in their classroom using a push-in model and 
co-teaching with the classroom teacher. For ELLs that speak no to minimal English, PS 68 implements a freestanding 
ENL program for the mandated number of 180 free standing minutes.  ELLs are heterogeneously grouped within one 
class when possible to ensure consistency in the provision of services.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

PS 68 does not have a TBE program at this time, however, if the number of parents requesting the program increases 
then PS 68 will create a TBE program, according to the CR Part 154.2.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

PS 68 does not have a DL program at this time, however, if the number of parents requesting the program increases 
then PS 68 will create a DL program, according to the CR Part 154.2. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Administration works collaboratively with the ENL teacher to create a program to service the students for ELLs that meets 
their mandated time requirements and that supports core curricular instruction.  ENL integrated services occur during all 
content area instruction.  The schedule is made so that the ENL teacher collaborates, co-teaches, and pushes-in during Social 
Studies, Science, Math, and ELA.  Students at the expanding proficiency level are supported academically during content area 
instruction, while students at the transitioning, emerging, and beginner levels are supported academically mainly in ELA, and in 
the content areas where they demonstrate a need.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All instruction is provided to students in English. The ENL teacher has access to all of the units of study and supporting 
resources in ELA, Science, Math, and Social Studies via Google drive. All units of study are aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards. The ENL teacher previews each unit and daily planner as well as reviews formative assessment data 
collected in conjunction with the classroom teacher in order to provide multiple access points for ELLs via whole, small, and 
individual instruction throughout the school day. The ENL teacher will co-teach or parallel teach using visuals, front-loading, 
and/or task analysis when necessary to meet the needs of the ELLs within the class, as well as teach in small groups for all 
students that may be struggling.  ENL methods used include sheltered English for students at the emerging, transitional, and 
expanding proficiency levels.  For students at the beginner proficiency level, instruction will include some native language 
support or translation via technological devices and or assistance from other students that can communicate with the 
beginner ELL.

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Currently PS 68 does not have a TBE or Dual Language program, therefore, the students are not receiving periodic assessments 
in their home language. In the case of special education evaluations, we are cognizant that all ELLs referred for an evaluation 
must receive the evaluation in both their home language and English. Currently PS 68 does not have a testing grade, but is 
preparing for one in the near future.  As such, the 3rd grade curriculum will incorporate the use of bilingual dictionaries for 
ELLs at the beginning level of English language proficiency to be used for all exams throughout the year so that the student will 
know how to use this tool in the school year and in the future, during State exams such as ELA and Math, and the Science 
Exam.  A Scribe may also be provided that is fluent in the ELLs home language, if necessary.  For ELLs currently enrolled at PS 
68 that are not yet English proficient, testing is provided throughout the year via differentiation which includes separate 
location, extended time, differentiated exam presentation, and in some cases questions being read to aloud.  ELLs are 
encouraged to participate in all classroom exams as their peers, with differentiation, including having the classroom exam 
translated into the students' home language if necessary.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

At this time PS 68 does not have any Students with Interrupted Formal Education(SIFE) at the school. Nevertheless, we 
recognize that a student who has experienced gaps in formal schooling may lack the critical (social and academic) skills that 
are necessary to assist them in performing on grade level. The first step would be to determine if the child was in fact a SIFE 
student. If the student fits the criteria, an informal assessment would be administered to determine the student's level of 
literacy. If the student was deemed to be SIFE, an action plan would be put into effect  to meet the basic needs of the child. 
The next step would be to ascertain the amount of schooling the child has had and determine the child's academic functioning 
level. All possible support services would be employed (at risk SETSS, Title III Support, 50 minutes of mandated tutoring.) The 
classroom teacher in conjunction with the ENL teacher would collaborate to create a plan of instruction based on the student's 
specific needs. In the case of SIFE students, research suggests that a differentiated approach coupled with total physical 
response (TPR) and sheltered English methodologies have been successful. The student's progress would be carefully 
monitored and evaluated on a continuous basis. ELL students receiving service for 4 or more years are given an extension of 
services for standardized tests. For those students, the academic interventions focus more on text complexity. Extensive 
preparation in the writing workshop is also done in the ENL setting. In the case of long term ELLs, the Child Study Team would 
meet with the ELL's classroom teachers and ENL teacher to review student work to see if there was an academic issue 
impeding the student's language acquisition. Former ELLs are provided with 2 additional years of ENL support which can be 
delivered in the form of AIS or 50 minute mandated tutoring services by the ENL teacher. The school's test coordinator is also 
appraised by the ENL teacher of all students eligible for continued testing accommodations.  Newcomers will receive 
differentiation through one to one teacher directed activities.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
PS 68 has a partnership with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP). As part of the partnership, teachers have 
copies and/or access to all of the TCRWP instructional resources including curricular guides and calendars, anchor charts, 
rubrics, and exemplar student work. These resources are provided to the teachers in printable format that also comes in other 
languages in order to support native language use whenever necessary.  In addition, PS 68 utilizes Fundations for students in K-
1 and all teachers have access to kits for their own grade which include alphabet cards, curricular guides, assessments, and 
manipulatives to aid in the teaching of phonics and sight words. A technological weekly reader is also shared and read aloud by 
the classroom teacher via the Smartboard, where technology lends itself for manipulating the screen in order to focus on 
phonetic details and vocabulary acquisition.  All of these resources have helped accelerate English language development as 
our ELLs have made progress throughout the school year towards meeting end-year benchmarks as indicated by data collected 
at the school level through TCRWP Benchmark Assessments.  Additionally, PS 68 utilizes the FOSS Science program and Go 
Math programs to provide content-specific instruction, which utilizes technology with hands-on in order to hold the students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

attention and to promote learning.  These math lessons support all students, including ELL-SWDs with differentiation, 
manipulatives and problem solving strategies.  In the event that PS 68 admits an ELL student that is also SWDs, he/she will 
receive ENL instruction as mandated by the results of their NSYITELL and NYSESLAT scores, as well as by the accommodations 
and modifications called for on their IEP.  The ENL teacher will work closely with the Speech Therapists, OT, and PT to ensure 
that all services are provided to the ELL-SWDs as needed per child and without conflicting one another. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
PS 68 has an 8 period day. The first period of every day is utilized as a General Meeting block where teachers provide a daily 
school wide community citizenship strategy targeted to instill a new behavioral and or learning goal.  These community 
citizenship strategies serve as instruction to students at, above, or below grade level to ensure students are making academic 
and social progress.  By incorporating this as a school wide meeting, PS 68 is fostering inclusion which facilitates a commonality 
for all students.  This helps the ELL-SWDs familiarize themselves with the mainstream student body and builds the comfort for 
that child to feel within the least restrictive environment.  Throughout the school day,  the ENL teacher pushes in and co-
teaches in various subject areas and works with groups of students within their classroom to support English language 
development and proficiency.  For ELLs-SWDs, programming allows for integrated and heterogenious grouping with peers on, 
below or above the students' grade level by one grade which provides opportunity for integrating with non-disabled 
peers.  Grouping size will not exceed the number of students allowed as indicated on the ELLs-SWDs IEP.  Students that 
progress academically and who can monitor their own learning and behavior and who are comfortable and feel confident to 
participate in an ICT setting will be considered for full time placing in ICT classes.  The ELL-SWDs must feel prepared and 
comfortable to go into the ICT classroom in order to attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  All 
decision will be made by a team made up of the Principal, the childs' classroom teacher, ENL teacher, School Psychologist, and 
the childs' parent(s).  Integration of individual periods may occur throughout the day for periods where the ELL-SWDs is 
capable of working according to his/her peers in the ICT classroom.  Integrating the ELL-SWDs in the ICT classroom facilitates 
and prepares the child to familiarize themselves in a classroom where mainstreamed students participate, and they will then 
become comfortable in the classroom where their peers.  All staff that teaches the ELL-SWDs is knowledgeable of all IEP goals 
and BIP for each ELL-SWDs and work closely together to ensure all IEP goals are attained. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are offered in English at PS 68. Native language 
instruction will be provided for all ELLs at the beginner English language proficiency level in all content areas, as an 
intervention program for that ELL.  All lessons are based on a balanced literacy method, including read aloud, shared reading, 
reading and writing workshop, as well as the use of scaffolding techniques, graphic organizers and pre-teaching of vocabulary. 
These lessons are offered to all subgroups with differentiation for each sub-group. For the math subject area, PS 68 introduces 
specialized vocabulary, manipulative and visual cues, small group activities integrated with literature and clarified directions 
are utilized. The Science subject area focuses on small cooperative learning groups, integration of non-fiction science genre 
into the balanced literacy program, hands-on approach, and implementation of Science Standards Curriculum in all science 
lessons. We provide students with more research opportunities through technology. The Social Studies subject area provides 
ELLs with more research opportunities through technology, project based lessons, non-fiction social studies genre literacy 
materials, familiarization with primary source documents, and thematic units that correlate with the New York State Social 
Studies Curriculum as well as with the classroom teacher.  For the math subject area, PS 68 introduces specialized vocabulary, 
manipulative and visual cues. Small group activities integrated with literature and clarified directions are utilized and thematic 
units that correlate with the New York City Scope and Sequence as well as with the classroom teacher.  All content area 
subjects are being infused via literature that are rich in academic vocabulary and that provide opportunity for English language 
acquisition and are differentiated accordingly for each ELL sub group. All grammar mini lessons are taken from the guided 
reading as well as teacher prepared materials. All data is collected informally and formally by the teacher teaching the content, 
the Science teacher keeps a portfolio with the students' work; the classroom teacher maintains individual folders for each 
student, for each content area.  Student work is assessed in order to determine student academic growth and further 
instructional needs.   A supplemental program such as after school is available to all the ELLs in PS 68, which also serves as an 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

intervention program and in which material presented is differentiated to target all ELL subgroups. All intervention programs 
at PS 68 are offered in English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data from last year, which yielded growth in student academic performance, PS 68 will continue to implement an RTI 
program for ELLs and is currently working on implementing an RTI program designed to help the ELLs reach academic 
proficiency for ELLs that are in Kindergarten.  ELLs in 1st grade that qualify for RTI instruction are currently receiving this 
support during the beginning of the school day.  Each kindergarten teacher will select the students including ELLs that require 
extra academic intervention. All RTI instruction will be delivered during the RTI block at the beginning of the school day. 
Students in RTI receive instruction in guided reading. Each class concentrates on the students' needs whether it be academic 
vocabulary acquisition, content area support, written responses, English language verbal acquisition. RTI is available for both 
ELLs and monolingual students and will continue to be implemented for the upcoming school year. It is expected that this will 
improve student acquisition of subject area vocabulary and understanding.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 68 does not currently have a bilingual program but will open one if the number of parents requesting the program meets 
the requirement as per the CR Part 154.2. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All programs offered at PS 68 are open to all students regardless of grade, academic level, or English language proficiency. 
Notices sent home introducing any programs at PS 68 are sent home in English and in the parents' preferred language as 
indicated on the second sheet of the HLIS and revised annually on the Blue Emergency Contact cards. These notices are 
translated for those parents that have indicated that they prefer to have notices sent to them in another language either by a 
staff member that speaks that language or by the Translation and Interpretation Services affiliated with the NYC Dept. of 
Education, at 718-752-7373. In this manner, PS 68 has assured that all parents or caregivers of its student body are made 
aware of all programs and events taking place at PS 68 and thereby has afforded equal access to all ELLs for all school 
programs. Programs include but are not limited to after school enrichment, and are open to current and former ELLs.  ELLs that 
participate in these programs find them academically enhancing.  ELL participation in these programs enhances their 
socialization skills, English language use and proficiency, and immediate social cultural norms This program is taught by 
Certified Teachers. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials used to support ELLs at PS 68 are: Scholastic High-Frequency Readers, Author study books, Non-fiction 
literature such as National Geographic, Technology, such as the National Geographic website is used to assist with syntax and 
lexical acquisition as well as phonetic use and book /story features.  The Barnes and Noble Storytime Online is used to help 
students visualize as well as listen to story format and to enhance re-telling skills.   Audio Listening Centers: read alouds, read 
alongs, music, and poetry are also used to sharpen listening and re-telling skills. Games on Ipads such as ABC splash and 
Starfall, are used to help ELLs with letter sound recognition, and other grammatical skills. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

PS 68 exercises the ENL program model. Home Language instruction is used strictly for the newcomer ELLs that speak zero 
English language and Beginner, Intermediate, Emergent, and Advanced ELLs that appear to be experiencing a loss of self 
esteem. In these instances, the ENL teacher, with the use of a computer, will reach out to the ELL by doing a search of that 
students' country. The "Images" prompt of the internet is used as opposed to the literary version of the search. The student is 
then encouraged to identify and share his / her knowledge of the images. The ENL teacher helps the student by stating the 
word of the images in English that the student has identified either by TPR or verbally. Sometimes, the ENL teacher may ask for 
the help of another student, staff member, or parent that speaks the same language as the zero English language ELL, to 
communicate with the zero English language ELL but only for one word or short phrase translations. The zero English language 
ELLs are encouraged to draw a response to the lesson on hand and to write a one word or simple phrase describing their 
drawing. The writing can be done in their home language and then translated to English collaboratively with the ENL teacher. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

The students' writing if not in English, is then asked to be written in English on the same paper that the student wrote in their 
home language. This is done to promote a bridge or relationship between the two languages (the students home language and 
English), and to help foster learning of the English language, and to promote communication. Home language instruction is also 
provided via home language literature in the classroom library. English language communication either by visuals, 
manipulatives, or TPR is expected from all ELLs in the ENL program. For students in the testing grades, 3rd through 5th, the use 
of bilingual dictionaries and glossaries will be incorporated into the daily curriculum so that the student can be fully 
familiarized with it before testing begins.  This is also helpful for older newcomers to the Public School system that may utilize 
the bilingual dictionaries and glossaries as a means of communication with peers and teachers.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

PS 68 implements an ENL program that corresponds to the ELLs and ELL-SWDs age and grade level as closely as possible. The 
entire program runs under the integrated approach, however in the event that stand alone groups should be necessary, the 
ELLs will be grouped in accordance with the English language level that the ELL scored under either from the NYSITELL or the 
NYSESLAT, and within two grade bands of the ELLs grade. The same programming will apply to ELL-SWDs so that they may 
participate in academic opportunities as those as their peers.  This grouping is done to avoid self esteem issues and confidence 
issues for the ELL and ELL-SWDs as well as to closely correspond to their cognitive needs as possible as well as the mandates on 
the IEP is any.  Differentiated lessons are prepared for that group in order to meet all of the students' needs and goals as 
stated on the IEP.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS 68 currently shares the school building with PS 66, a Pre-Kindergarten school.  Both facilities share all resources and 
coordinate efforts to ensure all the academic, linguistic and socio-emotional needs of the ELLs as well as those of all the 
students in both facilities are met.  Communication between staff of both schools is daily and ongoing.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In May, parents of newly registered Kindergarten students are invited to PS 68s' Kindergarten Orientation. At this event, newly 
incoming Kindergarten students and their parents are introduced to the Principal and Staff, the school nurse, teachers, school 
aides and other school staff. An informational presentation is made by the Principal, school nurse, ENL teacher, and PTA 
President as well as classroom teachers. Family Handbooks are distributed to all who attend and are mailed to parents who do 
not attend. The handbook contains general school information and procedures, goals, checklists, supply lists, are translated as 
needed and available electronically.  Parents are welcomed to the school, provided with pertinent information and are 
afforded the opportunity to ask questions. They are also guided through the school building to familiarize themselves with 
it.  In September, all families are invited to a get together in the PS 68 school yard where they are introduced to their childs' 
teachers, other school personnel, and future classmates. Many of the current and incoming students attend each year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

ELLs that are at the Zero English Beginner English language levels, are encouraged to communicate in English, but may elect to 
communicate in their home language so long as they support the communication by retelling it or presenting it in another 
genre to demonstrate comprehension of the material.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

PS 68 does not currently have a Dual Language program but will open one if the number of parents 
requesting it meets the requirement according to the CR Part 154.2.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At PS 68 all teachers are teachers of ELLs.  The ENL teacher at PS 68 attends PD offered by the Division of English Language 
Learners and Student Support which aides in preparing lessons plans that support ELLs academic engagement in the Common 
Core Learning Standards. Often times, guest speakers, compliance specialists, and representatives from major educational 
publishing companies are invited to offer teaching insights that help align the ENL program to the Common Core Learning 
Standards. These PDs are then turn-keyed in order to support classroom teachers in techniques and methods in delivering the 
instruction not only to the ELLs in their classrooms, but also to other students who would benefit from the support.The ENL 
teacher is also scheduled to attend the grade team meetings of the students whose grade (s)he teaches in order to become 
familiar with the Common Core aligned units of study, strategies to support literacy development, and to share best practices 
with classroom teachers. In addition, the ENL teacher is invited to attend choice workshops offered by teachers and related 
service providers to support him/her with incorporating new ideas in content-related pedagogy. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development (PD) is offered to all common branch teachers, subject area / cluster teachers.  It is also provided for 
all support personnel such as lunch staff, school aides, secretaries and service providers such as Speech, Occupational / 
physical Therapists and the school nurse, guidance counselors and school psychologists. Paras and the parent coordinator are 
also provided with PD.  In all, everyone in the school that directly or indirectly works with an ELL or ELL-SWD is provided with 
professional development so they may know how to communicate and how to understand the way the student communicates. 
All school personnel of PS 68 including the Principal are made aware at the September PD,  of the differences between Basic 
Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP). This helps them to better 
understand, and plan better communication as well as assessments for the ELL in their classroom. It also helps them to 
familiarize themselves with the different levels of expectations from the ELL students and how to guide the students to 
perform at the same expectations of their peers.  They are also asked to sit the ELL near the students that are most active in 
the classroom so that the ELL is surrounded by an English language rich environment as much as possible. The ENL teacher 
models for the teachers and Paras of ELLs how to produce a verbal response from the ELL by using the TPR and visual cues 
methods and techniques. At the November PD (Election Day), all school staff is encouraged to share how the ELLs learning 
style is / may be affected by their cultural norms. Awareness in cultural differences, cultural sensitivity, and acceptance is then 
discussed by the ENL teacher. Teachers and Paras of PS 68s ELLs are encouraged to communicate with the ENL teacher for any 
assistance they may need relating to the ELL. They are also encouraged to observe the ENL teacher in the ENL classroom 
whenever possible.  PD for the staff also includes at least 15% of PD for non ENL teachers each Monday, and up to 50% PD for 
the ENL teacher as per the CR Part 154.2.  Records of all PDs are kept in the form of sign in sheets.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

 

Parental involvement is considered crucial in the acquisition of the English language in the ELL. To foster a relationship 
between the ELLs parents and the school, PS 68 conducts individual meetings with the parents on Tuesdays, where each 
Tuesday will be dedicated to an individual parent.  In this way the parent can voice his / her concerns about how their child is 
learning in school, and how PS 68 can best help reach their child academically.  Parents that can not attend a face to face 
meeting, are provided with the ENL teachers email and class phone extension.  In some cases parents do not want to 
communicate with the school.  These parents are provided with notes from the teacher on their child's academic and linguistic 
progress.  Communication between both the teacher and the parents is always encouraged and welcomed.  Records of 
individual meetings are kept by the ENL teacher, detailing the parents' concerns and topics discussed. Parents will be asked to 
sign and date a log which will be placed in a folder and maintained by the ENL teacher. Parents that can not attend face to face 
meetings, will be reached via telephone with translators if needed and these conversations will also be logged and kept by the 
ENL teacher.  Also, parents are surveyed to determine the best day and time as well as the topic they would like to learn more 
about in order for administration and teachers to plan and deliver parent workshops.Other parent meetings will be 
encouraged ruing open school week, portfolio night, and other open school opportunities that the parents can attend.  In 
addition, the mandated parent teacher conferences, teachers from each grade and speech therapists offer two 
additional workshops on literacy and math, including strategies taught in class and home support. Translation services are 
provided should parents need. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELLs are invited to become involved in the ELLs education.  To promote and facilitate such involvement, parental 
workshops in academic and social issues are also offered to parents.  These workshops include information that will help the 
parent understand the schools' homework, trips, lunch and school safety policies. They may teach the parents how to assist 
the ELL with math, reading, and academically motivating games and websites.   To foster a relationship between the child and 
home, PS 68 will implement future opportunities that will allow the parents and the children to feel welcome at PS 68 and part 
of the PS 68 family.  These activities include but are not limited to: Read Aloud night, Movie night, Family game night, Culture 
Dinner Night.  One such activity in place at PS 68 is the Playground Reading Fun program which runs once a year in honor of 
the child that the school playground is named for; which loved to be read to and to have fun.  This activity serves as a 
motivator for the student population at PS 68 to read, with a partner or individually and to have fun with reading.  Parents of 
ELLs and ELL-SWDs are also provided with opportunities to participate in school trips and classroom parties.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lorrie Brown, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
