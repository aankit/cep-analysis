Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

VISION - PS/MS 280 cultivates lifelong learners and believes each child is capable of achieving academic excellence 
through rigorous instruction in a supportive environment to be prepared for college, careers, and life in the 21st 
century. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

MISSION - “Challenging students’ intellect, encouraging independent thinking, and fostering social responsibility” 
by: 

 

 

 

 

  Using professional development to strengthen our instructional core by examining and further refining our 

practices aligned to Advanced Literacy. 

  Continuing to develop collaborative teacher teams, improving teacher practice, while monitoring student 

progress towards increased student outcomes. 

  Partnering with parents, students, and the school community to foster a shared responsibility, while 
integrating culturally responsive social-emotional learning strategies to help students reach their full 
academic potential. 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The student demographic at PS/MS 280 is comprised of 24.3% ENL students and 28% SWD. The CEP was created 
through collaborative efforts on the part of the principal and the other members of the SLT with support from 
assistant principals and content areas coaches to gain an even perspective from both elementary and middle school 
practices. The constituents met weekly to reflect, discuss and record examples of coherent school-wide practices 
regarding curriculum, instruction and assessment.  

Coaches and administrators at the elementary and middle school level consolidated a summary of their common 
practices for each component of the CEP. 

 

 

We have also strategically partnered with consultants who are dedicated to increasing teacher effectiveness, one of 
the most critical factors in student success. Working closely with the right consultant services can transform how 
educators work together at urban public schools, helping the most effective teachers develop the skills they need to 
lead their peers and drive school-wide improvement. One specific initiative in our school includes implementing 
Mastery Connect, a web based tool to define essential key standards to be measured and tracked. We build common 
assessments and organize them on curriculum maps, align assessments to standards, administer, norm and score the 
assessments as a team and adjust instruction based on the data analysis. Being the one of the first schools in NYC to 
pilot the Mastery Connect Tool, we continue to build teacher capacity and develop formative assessments to drive 
instruction. For the 2018-2019 school-year, PS/MS 280 has been chosen as a lead school for Teaching Matters’ 
Network Improvement Community initiative (NIC). As a NIC school, Mastery Connect will be used to monitor student 
progress against the standards, a competency based coaching model for teacher leaders will result in micro-
credentialing teacher leaders, and structured opportunities for collaboration will continue. The intended outcome of 
participating schools will result in receiving Proficient or Well Developed in QR 2.2, 4.2, both components in which 
PS/MS 280 received a Well Developed in the 2014 school Quality Review. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Our ENL population is 24.13%. A goal that we have is for 50% of students to make at least one level gain of 
performance on the NYSESLAT test. To meet this goal, we hired a fourth ENL provider to meet their service 
requirement. In addition to a pull-out ENL program, ENL teachers are also pushing in to students' regular classroom to 
provide students with additional support in accessing the general ELA curriculum.  

 

Our SWD population is 37.14%. The goal is to raise the percent of students reaching a proficiency level of 3 or 4 on the 
New York State ELA assessment from 9.6% to at least 12%. To reach this goal, we will use formative assessments to 
identify areas of needs and work with these students during small group instruction as provide academic intervention 
support (AIS). 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year, PS/MS 280 has made significant progress in the Framework for Great Schools element related to 
building stronger family ties. This past year, we invited families in to learn about their child’s progress and to learn 
about the rigorous curriculum students engage through monthly parent workshops hosted by classroom teachers. 
Parent engagement continues to be a goal for our school, so that we can work together for greater student outcomes.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

According to the 2014-2015 Quality Review, our school’s strength is aligning curricula across subjects and grades to 
Common Core Learning Standards and strategically integrating the instructional shifts. Teacher teams plan and refine 
units of study and academic tasks using student work and assessment data. Impact: The school’s strategic curricular 
decisions result in coherence across grades and subjects for all students, and promote college and career readiness. 
Teacher team’s use of varied student data and student work ensures all learners have access to the curricula and that 
tasks are cognitively engaging. 

 

Each year, we look at Item Analysis Reports from the state assessments and create a trends analysis by grade. This 
analysis is shared with teachers so they can make curricular adjustments in ELA and MATH.  

Needs: 

According to the 2017 ELA trends analysis, it was determined that ELA curriculum needed to be modified, refined and 
focused on key standards, so that teachers focus on a fewer standards per unit of study allowing for a deeper student 
understanding and demonstration of the mastery of each standard. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers will be able to effectively develop coherent instruction that advances students through the 
content through cognitively engaging learning activities and which will result in a 10% increase in average ELA 
proficiency to 2.55 and math proficiency to 2.70. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13

Coaches/Administrators 

Teachers will engage in cycles of Teacher Driven Observations 
(TDO) following protocols from The Transparent Teacher. The 
observed teacher will set the focus aligned to school wide goal 
(i.e. thoughtfully construct lessons that account for individual 
learning needs including ELLS and SWD, incorporating 
appropriate resources and materials, and the intentional 
grouping of students) and charge peer observer with 
collection of data on a specific aspect of his/her teaching. 
Pairs of teachers will analyze the data to set next steps to 
improve practice using a non-evaluative, action research 
based approach. 

Continue to refine curriculum with a focus on identifying key 
standards for each unit so that all students, including bottom 
1/3, SWD and ELLS, gain a deeper meaning of key standards 
and have more opportunities to show mastery on specific 
standards. Through small group instruction bottom 1/3 
students will receive targeted instruction. 

Develop and implement specific protocols with clear 
expectations, checklists and rubrics for engaging ALL students 
in quality discussions especial students in the bottom 1/3, 
SWD and ENL students, using strategies such as accountable 
talk stems, protocols for classroom discussions such as 
Number Talks, Book Club Discussions, Debates, and 
Presentations etc.) 

Create and capture additional assessments on Mastery 
Trackers for ELA and MATH that address standards that were 
not previously assessed.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Strengths: 

According to the most current School Quality Guide, our school exceeds the target with a 4.48 in supportive 
environment. Our strength in providing a safe and productive learning environment includes overall safety, peer 
interaction and classroom behavior. This is in part due to offering programs that develop the whole child. Some 
examples of K-8 engaging programs include K-8 AIS programs for students who rank in the bottom 1/3, K-2 academic 
enrichment morning program, BOKS Morning Fitness programs, Basketball, Volleyball, Football, Green Team, after 
school Arts in partnership with the Bronx Arts Ensemble to offer dance, chorus, Latin drums and visual arts, and 
Partnership with Bronx Gear Up Network to offer enrichment in the content areas and promote college and career 
readiness. Our current attendance rate is over 92%. 

 

Needs: 

To further engage students in their learning and progress, we started implementing school-wide student-led-
conferences at the May PTC. According to the Assessment Matters Summary Report, to further develop this emerging 
practice of student led conferences, we need to: 

  develop a culture around “growth-mindset” among teachers, students and families. In a “growth-mindset” 
people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view 
creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.  

  Revisit teacher practices around student goal -setting, to develop a consistent standards aligned practice 

across grades and teachers that can be integrated into conferences. 

  provide parents with deeper supports early in the year for understanding standards and Mastery Connect 

data.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

 

By June 2019, teachers will have prepared and hosted 3 student led conferences during November, March and May 
PTC's in which students can present their work and set goals against the standards, which will result in 50% students 
making progress by at least 1 mastery level (i.e. from remedial to near mastery or near mastery to mastery) on power 
standards such associated with Problem Solving in Math and Word Meaning in ELA.

and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school receive a rating of Highly Effective for QR Rubric indicator 4.2: Teacher Teams. Teams of teachers meet 
regularly to analyze samples of student work, discuss trends in student mastery using the Mastery Connect tool and 
make curricular adjustments to improve impact on student learning. Teachers engage in Professional Learning Cycles 
and use an inquiry approach to improve teaching practice that have high impact on student learning. Team meetings 
are documented on google docs. 

 

 

According to Assessment Matter’s Consultant summary report, we need to continue to build and sustain teacher- 
team capacity to improve formative assessment practices school wide by:  

○ leveraging coaches to support and monitor the progress of all teams in implementing and tracking common 
formative assessments, beyond unit and benchmark assessments.  

○ building the analysis of frequent common formative assessment data, as well as the implementation and testing of 
effective classroom -based formative assessment practices, into each team’s databased cycles of inquiry.  

○ Use intervisitations to further spread innovative student centered assessment practices (such as analyzing strong 
and weak work samples 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 90% of teachers will engage in 3 rounds of intervisitations to learn and implement common formative 
assessment practices to improve student outcomes, resulting in an increase of Advance Rating by 1 level in 3d.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

An area of strength that aligns to Quality Review indicator 5.1, noted on our Spring 2017 PPO visit, states that we 
have ensured that teachers understand they're accountable for monitoring student progress. Data is analyzed and 
then students who need support are provided academic interventions. Student data is constantly tracked and 
monitored to determine student growth through a variety of systems that are accessible to administrators, teachers 
and parents. Analysis of data is collected and reviewed by the instructional leaders to determine teacher and student 
support.  

 

Feedback from the 2017 PPO, which aligns with the Quality Review Rubric, states that a priority should be placed on 
highlighting teachers who are strategically using multiple teaching strategies to support all students and who are 
developing open-ended questions that promote higher order thinking through rigorous tasks 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 90% of teachers will have participated in at least 3 professional learning cycles where they will collaborate 
to plan and implement at least 2 out of the 10 thinking practices from Making Thinking Visible by Ron Ritchhart. This will 
result in an increase in students' engagement in quality discussions measured by peer and self-assessment rubrics.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

According to the 2014-2015 School Quality Review : 

 

● The school has created monthly workshops for parents, on Tuesdays, during which teachers review the curriculum 
for the coming month, the assessments being used, and student progress. Parents stated that the workshops give 
them a clearer understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards and provided them with tools to support their 
children at home with the strategies they learn in school. One parent said she told her child he was doing his 
homework incorrectly when he was marking his paper with stars, underlining words, and circling phrases, but then 
she came to a workshop and learned that these were the strategies her son was using. Additionally, parents receive 
monthly standards-based progress reports.  

 

● Teacher and school leaders effectively use technology-based communication tools for parent out-reach, giving real-
time data and to keep them informed of school events. In kindergarten through grade 4 teachers use Class 

Needs: 

Based on 2016-2017 School Survey, 10% of parents feel that there aren't enough opportunities for them to come in 
an view classroom instruction. 

Based on parent attendance at monthly workshops, we need to continue to engage parents and families so they are 
likely to play an active role in supporting their child’s education.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

 

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

140 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Our belief is that in order for students to progress academically all aspects of a child's development must be 
addressed and nurtured. 
 
This is especially true of our STH population. 
 
STH funds have been used in the following manner: 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

to purchase multiple uniform shirts for students 
to purchase book bags containing supplies such as notebooks, pencils etc. 
to purchase independent level reading books so that student's can create home libraries 
to purchase various school supplies crayons, markers,etc. that are distributed throughout the course of the 
year as they are consumed 
I pads and chrome books have also been obtained for student use 

 

 
 
School staff employs a team approach and closely monitors the progress and well-being of our STH. 
Key staff members are made aware of each child's situation and the following safety nets and strategies and put into 
place : 
 
Pupil accounting secretary ensures that the child and parent are provided with metro cards and helps to ascertain 
other modes of transportation such as a school bus. This helps alleviate anxiety on both the parents and child's part 
and makes it easier to get to school on time and have good attendance ( most shelters where students are placed are 
typically very far from the school's they attend)  
 
The Assistant Principal through her efforts with the Helen Keller Foundation has made it possible for the student's to 
receive free eyeglasses. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

The Parent Coordinator meets with each family member to welcome them and also offer any support and guidance 
that is needed. 
 
Guidance Counselors and the Sapis Counselor provide group and individual counseling. 
 
Cafeteria Staff has been informed that they must provide some type of meal/snack at any point of the day when the 
child arrives to school. 
 
Every effort is made to include the student's in all extended day intervention programs and enrichment programs. 
(transportation is made available and options offered so the student's can attend)

Kindergarten Orientation is held in June prior to a child's entrance into Kindergarten at PS/MS 280. Two sessions are 
held, one in English and one in Spanish. During this session parents are invited to the school to meet the kindergarten 
teachers and walk through the current kindergarten classrooms. The Math and Literacy Coaches also provide an 
introduction to the curriculum and learn more about the emotional/social transition their child will face from the 
guidance counselor. 

Our Response to Intervention Team (RTI) provides parents with resources for struggling Kindergarten students so they

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/MS 280, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/MS 280 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

The goal of our ENL Title III program is to empower our ELLs with the necessary skills, so that 
they can become English proficient and meet the Common Core Learning Standards. It is our 
belief that ELLs acquire English language skills by being immersed in the language.  The 
children will be taught in English, however Native Language will be used to provide support to 
children who need it. The teachers will incorporate various ENL strategies, methodologies and 
good practices in their lessons. The ENL standards and the Common Core Learning Standards 
will be an integral part of lesson planning. After examining the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL 
results along with the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), pertinent information will be utilized to 
develop an instructional program that will promote academic achievement for ELLs specifically 
in their sub groups. ELL sub groups will encompass Newcomers, Developing, Long-term, 
SIFE, ELLs with disabilities and former ELLS.  Our after school program will focus on 
developing the four language modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing. The program 
will consist of 5 classrooms: one kindergarten class that will service all language proficiency 
levels-Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding and one first grade class 
of all proficiency levels, one second grade class which will service all language proficiency 
levels,  one third grade class of all proficiency levels and one fourth grade class with a focus on 
long term and Commanding ELLs.  Each class will service from 15-24 students of different 
language proficiency levels.  The ENL teachers and the content area teachers will work in both 
flexible grouping instruction and whole class instruction. In order to provide specific language 
instruction, an ENL teacher will push into three of the classrooms being taught by content area 
teachers. For example, an ENL teacher will work in the Kindergarten class for twenty 
five minutes and then rotate to first grade classroom for twenty minutes and then the 3rd grade 
classroom for twenty minutes. During this time, the ENL teacher will provide explicit language 
instruction while being supported by the content area teacher. The other two ENL teachers will 
provide their own language instruction in their perspective classrooms of second and fourth 
grades.The schedule will be as follows: 2:45pm-3:00pm Developing Academic Vocabulary /or 
Phonological Awareness, 3:00pm-3:30pm Building Comprehension- Mini Lesson:Teach/Model 
(Listening,Speaking & Reading), 3:30pm-4:00pm Practice/Application & Share (Listening, 
Speaking, Reading and Writing). Approximately, 95 children will be serviced under Title III. 
The program will be offered to all ELLs within the grade spans and the various ELL sub- groups 
including SETSS and SWDs .  The program will meet twice a week-Wednesdays and Thursdays 
for an hour and fifteen minutes.  Five bilingual Educational Assistants, who will be paid for from 
another funding source, will also facilitate with small group instruction in the kindergarten, 1st 
grade, second grade, third grade and fourth grade.    
 
              The teachers will choose a theme in which the children will be totally immersed for a 
duration of four to six weeks. The children will develop the four language modalities of 
listening, speaking, reading and writing via thematic units of study. An emphasis will be placed

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
on developing thematic units throughout the content areas.  A specific focus will be placed on 
building literacy skills,reading comprehension and writing in the upper grades. The teachers will 
purchase materials that will enhance the thematic units of study as well as deepen the childrens' 
understanding of various concepts and topics. The materials purchased will be tailored to 
promote and facilitate the acquisition of language.  These materials are supplemental and differ 
from the materials used throughout the school day. Title III will fund an array of materials for 
example, Continental Press-Chall Popp Phonics, Read,Reason and Write: New York Animals, 
Bears and Legends of America's Past, Phonics by Pearson on all levels, Lakeshore vocabulary 
development activities, bare books, notebooks, oak tag, folders, crayons, pencils, paper, markers 
and other consumables as well as art materials for culminating activities. In addition, we will use 
some units from National Geographic-(Windows on Literacy & Reading Expeditions) Language, 
Literacy and Vocabulary.  The RIGOR- intervention for ELLs kit will be used in the upper 
grades as well. Thematic units might include Dinosaurs, Bears, Transportation, The Solar 
System, Wolves, Animals of the Polar Region, Nocturnal Animals, Mexico, Ancient Egypt, 
China, India, United States, Ocean Life, Rain Forest, Animal Habitats, Fairy Tales like the 
Cinderella stories around the World, Tall Tales and Food and Nutrition. Fiction and Non-Fiction 
books as well as Poetry and the Arts will be used to enhance each theme.  Throughout the 
development of each theme, the content areas of science, social studies, and math will be 
addressed.  The thematic units will run for the duration of a couple of weeks to a month. Once a 
theme has been completed, another one will be chosen.  At the conclusion of each thematic unit, 
the children will produce a culminating activity.  The children and teachers will partake in the 
decision of which theme is chosen next.  The proficiency levels will also be considered in order 
to provide differentiation of instruction. They will also keep a portfolio of all their work. The 
children will also develop and create books and crafts which will reflect  the specific thematic 
units which they have been learning about. At the end of the program, the children will have a 
celebration of their work and they will receive a completion certificate.  The parents will be 
invited to attend the celebrations.  On occasion, the parents may be asked to volunteer for 
classroom projects or to give a presentation. The program will begin on January 23, 2019 and 
will continue until the NYSESLAT (May 4-15, 2019).  The program will be offered to the 3 
ENL certified teachers as well as 3 content area teachers.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
             Paste response to questions here:   
Some of the assessments tools used to assess early literacy skills for ELLs are DRA (K-5), Reading Street -Benchmarks and unit 
exams,leveled readers,Teachers College-Running Records (6-8),  Fountas and Pinnell for Reading levels  correlations. In 
addition, the ENL teachers use National Geographics-Reach and Benchmark Explorers. In Reach, the children are assessed at 
the end of each unit of study and are grouped by language proficiency levels: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding. 
Teacher observation and differentiated teacher created assessments are also used for examples performance sampling based 
on specific tasks, integrated curriculum projects, multimedia presentations, story re-enactment, leveled questions, dioramas 
cooperative group presentations, buddy presentations and language experience activities.  The insights that the data provides 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

about our ELLs is that there is a need to create more rigorous lessons that would engage students. ELLs need to be provided 
with activities that will enhance their interpersonal communication skills as well as  developing critical thinking skills. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to ensure that formative assessments are being used as a guide for instructional planning, during formal and informal 
observations, school administrators view teacher plans and provide feedback for observations. Using Danielson, 
Administrators focus in on differentiated instruction, quality of instruction as well as rigor and how ELLs are being addressed in 
the instruction and the assessments used. This process is done for both the monolingual and ENL teachers. On occasion, during 
grade meetings or professional development, the teachers are asked to share best practices during a lesson with other 
teachers and this creates a forum for self assessment and peer assessment.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here:   The success of the ENL program and the services provided to our ELLs will be measured by 
how well the children perform on the NYSESLAT as well as other summative  assessments.  The growth can also be measured 
by the transition from one proficiency level to the next  as well as their scores on the NYS ELA and 
Math exams.  Meeting  annual yearly progress for ELLs is another way of evaluating the success our programs .  In addition, our 
school has purchased new Reading programs which are aligned to the Common Core State Standards. For example, Reading 
Street, Reach, Inside and Inside USA. Many of these programs have an ELL support resource section with an additional 
technology component as well as benchmarks and unit assessments . Mastery Connect and MY Cengage are also utilized to 
record students' scores on assessments used for both math and reading.  Parents are also provided with progress reports.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, the ENL teachers, the ELL Coordinator and both the Literacy and Math Coaches 
will devise a plan that would better address the needs of the ELLs. For example, which class would benefit from push-in or pull-
out ENL instruction? What students need individualized instruction, small group, Response to Intervention or Academic 
Intervention Services? 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
Our school uses  data as a guiding tool for instruction. Data is also used to determine what services should be put in place. One 
of the purposes for using a Response to Intervention model is to ensure that ELLs are given an opportunity to receive rigorous 
instruction while preventing children from being referred to special education because of lack of language skills . This model is 
used to build on the standard core curriculum utilized in classrooms. It provides intervention through a 3 tiered system of 
instructional support. The 3 Tiers of Instructional Support are Core of Instruction-Tier I, "Double Dose" of Instruction-Tier II and 
Intensive Intervention-Tier III. The levels of support can increase or decrease  based on the individual needs of each ELL. 
Through assessment and evaluation, students growth is closely monitored. Often ELLs are placed at the center of  Language 
acquisition vs Learning disability. The RtI framework affords ELLs  who are far  below standard, to receive instruction that is on 
their cognitive  level.  This instruction is an intervention. Once intense instruction is provided and students show growth, there 
may not be a need for the students to continue to the next tier.  Our ELLs are also invited to the Academic Intervention 
Services Afterschool Program. The teacher's focus  on skill specific, individualized, and small group instruction. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Paste response to question here:  
Assessment Analysis of the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT 2017-2018 
   The data reveals that 13.6% of our ELLs are Entering, 15.6% are Emerging, 19.7% are Transitioning, 51% are Expanding and 
20% are at the Commanding level.  The data further reveals that as children transition from one grade to the next, they 
generally move up a proficiency level or remain on the same level. This is extremely crucial as this affords us the opportunity 
to meet our AMAOs 1 and 2. Patterns across the modalities will affect instructional decisions made be the ENL teachers and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

the scores will be shared with the classrooms teachers as well. The teachers will tailor their lessons to meet the needs of ELLs 
across all language modalities and provide more focused instruction. The ENL Coordinator will also use this data to order 
appropriate materials to further help the ELLs with the academic areas of need. 
  According to the most recent English Language Arts exam, 84% of our 4th grade ELLs scored on Level I and 15% scored at 
Level II.   In the 5th grade 50% of our ELLs scored at Level I and 50% scored at Level II.  In the 6th grade, 90% of our ELLs scored 
at Level I and 10% scored at Level II.  In the 7th grade, 90% of the ELLs scored at Level I and 10% scored at Level I. In the 8th 
grade,100% of our ELLs scored at Level 1. 
  According to the most recent New York State Math exam, 62.5% of our 4th grade  ELLs scored at Level I, 31% scored at Level II 
and 6% scored at level III.  In the 5th grade, 52% of our ELLs scored at Level II and 47% scored at Level II.  In the 6th grade, 86% 
of our ELLs scored at Level I and 7% scored at Level II and 1% scored at Level III. In the 6th grade, 54% of the ELLs scored at 
Level I and 46% scored at Level II.  In the 7th grade, 54% of the ELLs scored at Level I and 45% scored at Level II. In the 8th 
grade, 100% of the ELLs scored at Level I.  
  Our ELLs performed slightly better in the NY State Math exam than on the ELA.  More ELLs scored at level II in math as 
opposed to the ELA where more of our ELLs scored on Level l . More emphasis will be placed on helping ELLs to develop 
more reading skills, vocabulary strategies and writing skills. ELLs in grades 4th and 6  th   scored higher at Level II part to do 
with the fact that they piloted the Modules from Engage. These modules, although very rigorous, provided students with more 
exposure and structure. Writing on Demand and look back and write also provided students with more scaffolds for their 
writing.    
  {According to the New York State Science exam, the 4th grade results were as follows: 10% of the ELLs scored at Level I, 40% 
scored at Level II and 40% scored at Level III and 10% scored at Level IV.  In comparison to last years Science scores, our ELLs 
scored higher this year than last year.  The increase in scores could be attributed to the increase of rigor in science and non-
fiction genre study throughout our grades.  It is imperative that we continue to provide our ELLs with high-quality instructional 
practices, scaffolds and numerous strategies.   
   Our ELLs are closely monitored and are provided with ENL services as per New York State CR Part 154 mandates.  English 
Language Learners who are in the proficiency levels of Entering and Emerging are provided with 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week. ELLS who are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels of language proficiency are provided with 90 
minutes of ENL and 90 minutes of ELA.  Additionally, ELLs who have scored Commanding in the NYSESLAT will continue to 
receive services for an additional two years. They will be provided with 90 minutes of integrated ENL in ELA, Math or any other 
Content Area. The ENL teachers as well as the classroom teachers who have ELLs, group them according to their language 
proficiency levels and reading levels.  The ENL teachers create rigorous and challenging lessons that promote the four language 
modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing.  In addition, an array of teaching materials, tools, manipulatives and 
literature pieces both fiction and non fiction are used to compliment the different learning styles.   Since the data reveals that 
our ELLs are not performing  well in the ELA exam, there will be a greater focus in both reading and writing. Children will be 
provided with additional scaffolds that will target literacy and writing instruction as well as reading and writing strategies. Our 
ELLs will also have the choice of participating in after school programs like AIS-morning or afternoon, Saturday Academy, Title 
III-Extended Day and a new Morning Program specifically designed for  Entering ELLs in grades 6-8 .  The ELLs will also be 
assessed through the following programs: Fundations and Wilson, Reading Street Benchmark for Guided Reading and Reach 
and Inside for freestanding ESL . They will receive instruction in strategies and skills for ELA and NYSESLAT exams using 
National Geographic Reach, English at Your Command, Continental Press and thematic units of study.  Teachers will monitor 
ELLs progress using data, formal and informal assessments, running records, DRA, Periodic & Standardized assessments and 
writing and math benchmarks.  ELLs will be provided with extensive and diverse vocabulary instruction, strategies and skills for 
reading and writing and small group reading interventions. Additionally, a focus will be placed on supporting ELLs to engage in 
quality discussions.  Although the ELL periodic assessment was not utilized this school year, it is definitely a consideration for 
next year. In the past it served as a tool for identifying the students' areas of needs and teachers used it to gain a better 
understanding of the skills their ELLs were strong and weak in. 
      In conclusion, since one of our school goal is to use data to drive instruction,  teachers will utilize Envision Math, Reading 
Street, Expeditionary Learning and Code-X and engage modules  to track their students.  Students will also be held accountable 
for their learning as well through Peer and self assessments and conferring notes. Students and teachers will also keep work 
portfolios, to further track their work.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

In order to disseminate these findings and make adjustments to our programs, the language allocation policy team will provide 
staff with opportunities to engage in conversations and feedback regarding ELLs and their sub groups. Time will be allotted for 
such discussions to take place during grade meetings, parent meetings with teachers and after school staff professional 
development guided by administration and coaches. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Paste response to questions here:   At present the numbers of ELLs being serviced are as follows: K=18, 1st grade=14, 
2nd grade=17, 3rd grade=25, 4th grade=17, 5th grade=23, 6th grade=14, 7th grade=15 and 8th grade=07.  The 
number of ELLs being serviced is 147.  This number includes both part time and self contained special education 
students.  15.75% of our school population are ELLs. The ENL students who are in an ENL pull out model are grouped 
and instructed homogeneously according to their language proficiency level as per the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL. When 
using the push in model of ENL, the children are grouped heterogeneously. The ENL instruction provided runs in 
intervals of 45 minute periods per day. ELLs who require 360 minutes of ENL instruction meet 8 periods a week, 
ELLs who require 180 minutes of instruction meet 4 periods a week and Commanding students who require 90 
minutes of instruction meet 2 periods a week. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:   At the moment, we do not have a Transitional Bilingual Program at our school. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:   At the moment, we do not have a Dual Language Program at our school. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Paste response to questions here:  The organization of the ENL program, ensures that the mandated services are 
provided as per CR Part 154-2. The flexibility in scheduling that the ENL teachers have  allows them to organize their groups by 
proficiency levels.  The ENL teachers meet with the classroom teachers to devise a schedule that best meets the needs of the 
ELLs in each class.  Our ENL teachers who provide ENL services are certified and provide both Pull-Out (organizational model) 
and Push-In (Co-Teaching) ENL instruction.   Entering and Emerging  ELLs are provided with 360 minutes per week of  ENL 
instruction and Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are provided with 90 minutes of ESL and 90 minutes of ELA instruction for a 
total of 180 minutes per week. Commanding students are provided with 90 minutes a week of support via ELA /Content area.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Paste response here:    ENL instruction Pull- Out model is delivered via the content areas with an emphasis in literacy,writing 
and math.  Although the main language used for instruction is English, Spanish as well as other languages will also be used 
when necessary.  Either the teacher will translate or interpret or a student who dominates the specific language will be asked 
to do so.  Additionally, glossaries, picture dictionaries, thesaurus,picture cards, bilingual dictionaries and realia will be used to 
support native language as well. The teachers use materials aligned with the common core learning standards. Talking 
dictionaries are also used. During the Push- In model of ENL instruction, the ENL teachers support the classroom teacher using 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

a co teaching model.The ENL teachers use the same or similar materials that the classroom teacher uses. For 
example,  Reading Street, Code-x and Expeditionary Learning.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Paste response to question here:  Since we do not have a bilingual or dual language program at this time in our school, ELLs 
who need interpretations or translations whether its school related or personal have never been denied the service. A trained 
staff member or pedagogy will assist children when necessary.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:  
     a)Students who are SIFE are also provided with additional services.  Parents are interviewed at registration to further assist 
the school with information pertinent to the child’s educational background thus ensuring proper class placement.  When 
students arrive at our school, they are given an informal assessment.  Students are assessed in their classrooms and are 
provided with the opportunity to work with small multi-level groups.  We do our best to pair the SIFE students with another 
student of the same country in order to provide them with additional support.  The students are reintroduced to a school 
setting. Students and parents are also given the opportunity to meet with a guidance counselor, the dean and the teacher. 
Staff members are also made aware of these students and are provided with ideas, activities and training that can further 
facilitate and support them. These students are also carefully monitored in order to organize a plan that would focus in on the 
their weaknesses and strengths. In addition, they are  provided with the same educational materials as all the other ELLs.   
 b) The plan for Newcomer  ELLs includes a parent workshop or individual conference for the selection of a program that best 
meets the needs of the ELLs and their parents.  Once our ELLs are identified and placed in their program selection, they are 
then provided with the services of English as a Second Language using the push-in and pull-out models.  In addition, our ELLs 
are provided with a class buddy/partner, AIS, differentiated instruction, scaffolding,  SIOP model, time for transition and after 
school programs. In order to address the No Child Left Behind  policy, student’s progress is tracked and monitored as these 
children will be required to take the ELA after one year.  To ensure students are prepared, the ENL teacher provides these 
students with two ESL units with intense focus on language acquisition.  In addition, these children also receive English 
Language Arts in their regular school program. 
c) Students receiving 4 to 6 years of English as a Second Language are also monitored in order to provide them with tailored 
instruction based on the results of the NYSESLAT modalities, ELA, State exams, teacher assessments, class work and 
homework.  Afterwards, the students are provided with services according to their individual needs. These services may 
include Fundations, Wilson, Guided groups for Reading and Writing, Early Intervention/At risk and Extended Day.  Additionally, 
ELLs  who have reached a proficiency level on the NYSESLAT will  be provided with two years of transitional support through 
testing accommodations, peer tutoring, AIS instruction and special programs offered after school.   
  d) Long term ELLs are provided with all mandated services and safety nets such as AIS support in Literacy and Math, Saturday 
Academy, individualized or small group instruction and regular meetings with the guidance counselor.  The ELL Coordinator 
monitors their progress and ensures that they receive the necessary services. Teachers provide students with meaningful 
feedback on their work and allow students the opportunity to self assess and set educational goals for themselves.  In addition 
to the city and state standards, teachers provide exemplars so students can have models. Students are also trained on 
different rubrics for the various writing genres.  They are encouraged to make connections across other 
disciplines.   Accountability also includes monitoring the funding allotted to facilitate second language acquisition and the 
effective use of classroom materials purchased.  The materials purchased vary and are age appropriate.  Instructional materials 
include collections from Reach for grades K-5, Lakeshore manipulatives such as create a Word and flip charts, Into English, 
English at your Command, Rigby for ELLs, authentic literature from Lectorium, book baggies with CDs, bilingual supplementary 
libraries and dictionaries, updated software, Big Books and thematic units. All supplementary materials are used to enhance 
context and content skills. The following are used as support: hands-on manipulatives, realia, pictures, multimedia, 
demonstrations, adapted text, graphic organizers, outlining, note taking, leveled texts and study materials, highlighted and

taped text, literature circles and cooperative grouping. 
e) The plan to support ELLs who pass the NYSESLAT is to continue to provide them a per mandate, with additional 2 years of 
support for additional testing accommodations, continue to allow them access to special ELL programs permitting space, small 
group instruction and access to the ENL resources if needed. These students will be provided with push in or pullout ENL 
support in the content areas for 90 minutes a week.  In order to provide ELLs who have passed the NYSESLAT with transitional 
support, the children will be tracked and monitored. In doing so, support will be provided in the subject areas as needed per 
individual students.  In order to determine what supports are needed, various forms of assessments will be utilized as well as 
City and State exam results. Title III will also be offered to these students as well as testing accommodations.   All our ELLs are 
exposed to Smart boards, laptops and classroom computers. The programs used vary.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:   P.S./M.S. 280 has a Kindergarten Collaborative Team Teaching class and a Kindergarten 
/1 st  grade self contained, Special Education class 12:1:1, a 1st grade CTT, a 2nd grade CTT and  a 2/3 self-contained Special 
Education class-12:1:1, two 3 rd  grade Collaborative Team Teaching classes,  a 4th grade Collaborative Team Teaching class, a 
4/5 Self-contained Special Education class-12:1:1, two 5th grade Collaborative Team Teaching classes, a 5th/6th grade Self 
Contained 12:1:1,  two 6th grade Collaborative Team Teaching classes, a 7th grade Self-contained Special Education-12:1:1 , 
two 7th grade CTT classes and an 8th grade Self Contained 12:1:1 and one 8th grade CTT.  The school is addressing alternative 
placement in Special Education by supporting students who are in the mainstream and providing them with all the support 
services they require or are entitled to as per their IEP.  Such services include: an educational assistant to support the child’s 
academic and language needs, occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, SETSS (Resource Room), Wilson 
Reading program, guidance counseling, I.S.T. evaluations/child study, updated IEPs, referrals with follow-up phone calls and 
feedback, parent meetings to discuss student progress, monolingual placement and bilingual referrals as well as CSE Type III 
alternative placement.   Some of the instructional strategies teachers use for ELLs with disabilities include: multi- sensory 
approach, modeling every activity, using mnemonic strategies to promote memory association, direct instruction, pacing 
instruction carefully thus ensuring clarity, presenting technical content in small incremental steps, writing legibly with focused 
text, using props to present narrative situations in a vivid and clear manner,using highlighters and underlining key words, using 
word frames, visual cues, outlining texts with a focus on the main idea, and using various forms of assessments. The materials 
used to provide instruction varies.  Some materials include: foam, raised and magnetic letters and numbers, dry erase boards, 
counters, beads, making word cards and other hands-on and teacher created activities. Grade appropriate materials are 
purchased such as make a word center from Lakeshore, technology and educational short videos and teachers bring in realia 
when introducing a new concept.  For example, using real fruits and making a salad, tens frames, abacus and large cube 
manipulatives for counting.    
 In order to meet the diverse needs of ELLs with disabilities within the least restrictive environment, the school has scheduled 
support periods within some teachers' programs.  Some teachers provide math support and small group instruction and other 
teachers provide literacy support or small group instruction. These providers work closely with the classroom teachers in order 
to integrate the class curricula with the instruction provided. The children chosen for small group instruction are usually 
identified by the classroom teachers, school administrators,  exam history or are IEP driven.  Additionally, ELLs who are 
classified with learning disabilities are served as per their IEP and usually receive multiple services.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here:  The school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to 
achieve and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. The teachers on each grade level meet weekly 
with the coaches and support staff to engage in conversations and protocols focused on student progress, analyzing student 
work, using data to drive instruction and analyzing performance trends on Mastery Connect. The teachers then use their 
findings and analysis to create differentiated activities and lessons, adjust curriculum and instructional practices and pace 
lessons within units of study. Through small guided groups and one on one instruction, the children are then taught as per 
their IEP goals and language proficiency level.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here:   The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA , math and other content areas 
are:  Response to Intervention,Academic Intervention Services, Guidance Counseling, Small Group-Guided Instruction, Wilson, 
Foundations, Saturday Academy and Title III Morning or After school for ELLs. Although the language of instruction is English, 
interpretation and translations are also provided in Spanish, if needed .     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here:    For the upcoming school year, the school is considering an AIS after school program for 
grades 4-8. This program will be offered in addition to Saturday Academy and Title III for ELLs.  
Title III will now service more children and an extra class has been added to service more third grade students since there are 
so many of them. The program will continue to run after school for two days a week for the duration of five months for an 
hour and fifteen minutes each day.  Additionally, a morning program will also  be implemented for grades 5-8. Our goal is to 
promote language acquisition through the content areas of Science, Math, Social Studies and improve in Reading and Writing 
through the study of thematic units and small group instruction. In addition, as part of the Title III After school program, the 
children will be using National Geographics and RIGOR from Benchmark. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here: Many years ago, before the parental option initiative was introduced, our school had a 
bilingual-Spanish/English program that consisted of a Kindergarten and a 1st grade and 2nd grade bridge class. As the 
demographics of our school community changed, so did the need of our parents. Although the parents were informed of the 
importance and the benefits of bilingualism, the parents were not persuaded.  Parents' desire for bilingual education began to 
decrease. Presented with the choices of bilingual, dual language and ENL services, parents began opting for the latter choice, 
thus the bilingual program at our school phased out. We will continue, however, to enhance  existing programs  and  tailor 
lessons and activities to meet the needs of our students.  We will continue to provide the students with quality instruction and 
promote high standards for all our English Language Learners.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here:   ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Because our ELLs are on different 
language proficiency levels, ELLs are able to take advantage of various programs as long as they meet the criterion for these 
programs.  They are not excluded from school wide activities and events.  They are represented in all our after school 
programs: basketball, volleyball, flag football, soccer, green team, yearbook committee, track and dance AIS Saturday 
Academy, Immigrant Grant morning program, Title III- ENL After school, Advisory, Life Skills, Las Divas, Peer tutoring 
and Project Gear Up-provides Academic services throughout the day  for 8  th   graders, Bronx Arts Ensemble  promotes  music, 
art, chorus and dance for the Middle School students.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Paste response to question here:  There are various instructional materials used to support ELLs. With this being said,  ELLs are 
given all materials used by the monolingual programs as well as materials that have been purchased to meet the specific needs 
of all ELL sub groups and targeted proficiency levels .  In Literacy, the Elementary level ELLs use Reading Street (K-4) that has an 
English Language Learners Handbook for each grade and In the Middle School Level,  ELLs in 5  th   grade use-Expeditionary 
Learning( modules from Engage). With the help of the ENL teacher, the classroom teachers have created parallel tasks and 
activities for the ELLs and SWD's. ELLs in grades 6-8 use Code-X when needed, there exists differentiated tasks. In Math, the 
Elementary level ELLs as well as the middle school ELLs use Envision Math (K-8) the program also provides a response to 
Intervention piece that is used for differentiated  instruction.  All programs mentioned above come equipped with a 
technology piece. The teachers are able to show the children samples,  videos and print resources and assign work. Parents 
have access to on- line resources in some cases both in Spanish and in English. These programs have built in bench marks and 
assessment pieces.  In the free standing ENL program, the children have there own materials that has been specifically 
designed for ELLs and is Common Core Aligned.  The Elementary students use Reach by National Geographic-Cengage and the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

Upper grade students use Inside and Inside the USA. Both programs have a technology  component as well. This affords 
teachers the opportunity to model lessons, demonstrate strategies, show beautiful realistic pictures where available, assign 
work to students, share interactive activities for the children. The ENL teachers can create, enhance and edit the lesson plan 
units on- line.  The programs also have assessments pieces after every unit . The lesson plan format promotes the language 
modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here:  Native language is supported by providing the students, when necessary, with translations of 
texts, bilingual books, glossaries, dictionaries, native language articles, books, literature and computer software.   
ELLs are also supported through small group instruction. During this time, students might feel more comfortable using native 
language to communicate their ideas clearer,  clarify key points and vocabulary and make connections in order to understand 
better. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Paste response to question here:   Required services support and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. Our 
school Finance Director along with other key staff members, Coaches and ELL Coordinator purchase grade and age appropriate 
materials.  Most of the materials purchased is now aligned to the CCSS.  The programs also come with  math manipulatives, 
picture cards, alphabet cards, picture books and guiding reading materials. The majority of the books ordered are leveled. 
Children are matched to their Reading levels. In order to enhance classroom libraries, books that have multi-levels have been 
purchased for example, Building Literacy for Entering and Emerging levels and RIGOR for Transitioning and Expanding levels. 
The support services are provided by licensed teachers.  Supports includes small group instruction, guiding groups, and peer 
groups.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here:  Although our school shares a building with another school,  we share common areas within 
the building. We service students form Kindergarten to 8th grade. The other school building services middle school students in 
grades 6th to 8th grade. There are various instructional materials used to support ELLs. With this being said,  ELLs are provided 
with all materials used by the monolingual programs as well as materials that have been purchased to meet the specific needs 
of all ELL sub groups and targeted proficiency levels .  In Literacy, the Elementary level ELLs use Reading Street (K-4) that has an 
English Language Learners Handbook for each grade and In the Middle School Level  ELLs in 5  th   grade use-Expeditionary 
Learning( modules from Engage). With the help of the ENL teacher, the classroom teachers have created parallel tasks and 
activities for the ELLs and SWD's , ELLs in grades 6-8 use Code-X when needed, differentiated tasks are available. In Math, we 
utilize Envision Math 2.0 for grades K-8 which comes equipped with a response to Intervention piece for differentiated 
instruction. All programs mentioned also have a technology component. The teachers are able to show the children 
samples,  videos and print resources and assign work. Parents have access to on-line resources in both Spanish and English. 
These programs have built in bench marks and assessment pieces.  In the free standing ENL program, the children have there 
own materials that have been specifically designed for ELLs and is Common Core Aligned. The Elementary students use Reach 
by National Geographic-Cengage and the Upper grade students use Inside-language, literacy and content and Inside the 
USA for Beginners. The programs also contain a technology component that provides assessments, resources for the students 
and the teachers. This affords teachers the opportunity to model lessons, demonstrate strategies, show beautiful realistic 
pictures where available, assign work to students, provide interactive activities for the children and the teachers can create the 
lesson plan units on line.  The programs also have assessments pieces after every unit. The lesson plan format promotes the 
language modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing and focus on the language proficiency levels. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here:  Some activities that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year are:

Various activities are conducted throughout the year like school dances for students.  The student council also partners up 
with a newly arrived ELLs to teach them how to get around the school building and give them advise on how to succeed in 
school.  In addition, the school counselors assist these new students through small group discussions and parent contact. In 
the upper grades, the Bilingual  SAPIS worker accepts newly arrived ELLs in a small group where she provides them with 
positive motivation and a forum in which they could express themselves . Additionally, the guidance counselors and the Dean 
of students work with their assigned grades to provide students with mini workshops and lessons on conflict resolution as well 
as promoting good study habits and strategies for adjusting to a new school. They also assist at-risk students with academics 
and behavior issues, teach life skills, good choices and bullying prevention.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:    Teachers must meet State certification licensing requirements.  The teachers are licensed in 
the area in which they teach.  The staff is provided with many opportunities for professional development on various topics 
that address the needs of the ELLs  both in the mainstream and special education. This year various workshops will be offered 
during grade meetings, common preps, professional development, volunteer lunch time meetings and after school.  All staff 
will be invited to the workshops. The personnel will include teachers, instructional coaches,  educational assistants, 
psychologists, occupational, speech and physical therapists, secretaries and the parent coordinator. The topics covered for 
professional development are listed below.   In addition, other areas of concern will be addressed during the year. 
•     Who are our ELLs and how are ELLs identified-HLIS/LAB/NYSITELL? 
•     Lesson planning and correlation with the standards, performance indicators and the new common core curriculum-
Emphasis on Co-Teaching/Co-Planning 
•     Examining the New language proficiency levels, language progressions and developing sample lessons with strategies 
focusing on the different Proficiency Levels 
•     What is the NYSESLAT? 
•     Tailoring lessons in the content areas to further meet the needs of ELLs and ELLs who are SWDs 
•          Common Core Learning Standards: Implications for all ELLs

•     Jose P. Training updates-New Common Core Curriculum as it pertains to ELLs 
•     SIOP model & Differentiated Instruction 
•     Scaffolding Language and Scaffolding Learning By Pauline Gibbons 
•     Addressing the Learning Styles 
*          Charlotte Danielson's- DOMAINS 1,2,3 &4    
            In addition,  all teachers of ELLs will receive specific professional development presented by the Literacy and Math 
Instructional Coaches and the Assistant Principals.  As part of our school wide Professional Learning Plan, the Instructional 
focus is: "If teachers plan and implement rigorous instruction that meet the depth and complexity of the CCLS and that further 
develops critical thinking and communication skills, then students will be more engaged and have an increased understanding 
through these quality discussions, Which will lead to increased learning and achievement." This instructional focus will allow 
teachers to develop and explore a rapport of best practices and strategies that support the levels of language proficiency 
Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding. In turn, the teachers will help support and encourage  ELLs on 
all levels to engage  in quality discussions and accountable talk.  
   As we thrive to expose teachers to the many facets of Danielson, Professional Learning Communities are encouraged.  All 
staff members are encouraged to meet once a week for grade level team meetings. These meetings are goal based and usually 
focus on student data and analyzing student data to drive instruction.   The ENL, special education, and the monolingual staff 
meet and plan collaboratively.  Teachers also meet with the ENL Coordinator to facilitate the implementation of future 
instruction as well as the use of the ENL toolkit and to address compliance issues. The Testing Coordinator works closely with 
the ENL staff in ordering grade specific and age appropriate materials, test prep booklets and providing on-going professional 
development with an emphasis on test taking strategies and thematic units.  The School Base Support team members work 
closely with the providers and teachers to ensure that the children are properly assessed.  The school leadership team meets 
with key staff to brainstorm ways in which to help children and increase parental involvement in the school and in school 
activities.  The guidance counselors also play an intricate part in helping ELLs transition.  They also meet with the teachers, 
administrators and parents to help these students transition in a school setting, adjust to a new culture and language. The 
guidance counselors aid the students during their selections of junior high schools and high schools. They serve as  mediators 
between teachers and students and students experiencing problems with other students .  
    
    Both the Literacy and Math Instructional Coaches meet and plan with the staff, present and model demonstration lessons 
and attend and facilitate every grade meeting.  
Paste response to question here:    Teachers of ELLs are offered all the professional development  mentioned above, this 
includes an invitation to any meetings that the ELL team might have as well.  This invitation is also opened to workshops being 
sponsored by the Office of ELLs, Eventbrite and the district.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Paste response to question here:  Fortunately, our school services grades K-8, making the transition from elementary to 
middle school much smoother.  The ENL teachers are veteran teachers who have developed a good support system to help 
aide ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school. They share notes, parent logs, insight and observations about 
their ELLs with the other teachers.  The guidance counselors are great facilitators  as well especially during  the transition from 
middle school to high school.  The middle school counselor meet with ELLs individually to help find high schools that offers 
excellent ELL programs. They confer with classroom teachers and call schools to ensure proper placement. 
Paste response to question here:  Our school plan to meet the professional development requirement of 15% as per CR Part 
154.2 will take place on specific Tuesday meetings during our scheduled professional development  time. This professional 
development will be aligned with the school wide Professional Learning Plan for the school year. This plan is designed to work 
in cycles. The 50% of total hours for the ENL teachers will be conducted on Tuesdays during scheduled grade planning time. 
The teachers will conduct a study group centered on a professional book. They will also attend workshops sponsored by 
Teacher s Matter, Office of ELLs and the district. The agendas will be kept on Google docs and a hard copy will be kept on file 
alongside the attendance.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:  Ample time is allotted in the school day for setting up individual meetings with ELL parents in 
order for the ENL teachers to meet with them to discuss the goals of the program, language development progress and 
language development needs in all content areas . At the beginning of the school year, the ENL teachers  meet the parents 
during meet the teacher night. The teachers collect phone numbers and email addresses in order to set up meetings. They 
send a copy of their prep schedule home with each student so parents are aware of their availability time. They can also meet 
with parents during the After school Parental Engagement time on Mondays. The teachers have sign in sheets that serves as 
evidence of the meeting. Later on, they log the meeting in their parent log sheet. Provisions for interpretation and translation 
are done on a needed basis by asking parents if they require an interpreter and by looking at the blue cards and home 
language surveys under the category listed as language of choice both written and spoken. If an interpreter is warranted in a 
language that no staff members or older student speaks, than the ELL Coordinator will communicate with the translation unit 
to locate one. During the meetings, the ENL teacher may invite the classroom teacher and collaborate on their observations as 
well as to provide pertinent information and data that could be used to support the ENL teacher's findings.  The AMAO 
Estimator/EDAT will also serve as a great tool during the meetings to provide parents with detailed data on individual students 
as well as focus in on filters like at risk, attendance, ELLs sub groups and provide feedback on specific skills that may need 
to work on.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, James Weeks, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand.The following 
data and methodologies are used to assess the language preferences of our parent community for both written 
and oral communication:  
a. Registration Screening- The parents fill out the Home Language Identification Surveys where they request the 
language in which they would like to receive written and verbal information. A Parent Survey and Program 
Selection Form are also used to determine language of preference. On the parents blue emergency cards, they are 
also asked what language they prefer the school to communicate with them both orally and written. Additionally, 
ATS reports on home language (RCPL) and (RAPL) can also used. 
b. Teacher Surveys-The teachers send home parent letters requesting the language in which they would like to 
receive information from the school 
c. Curriculum Night-The teachers meet with the parents and discuss standards, expectations, grade curriculum 
and areas of concern. Interpreters and translators remain on standby. There is at least two interpreters stationed 
on every floor.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

d. Parent/Teacher Conferences-Parents are encouraged to attend school wide meetings and conferences as well 
as individual meetings, as needed, per child. Translators, from our staff, are available for parents at these 
meetings/conferences.The following languages are spoken by our staff: Spanish, Albanian & Croatian, Italian, 
Haitian Creole, Arabic and French. Even though the teachers record their report card grades in STARS, hard copies 
of previous translated report cards are used so that parents have access to native language as well as English.  
e. The New York City Board of Education Website has provided excellent translations of important documents like 
Parents Bill of Rights,the Common Core Learning Standards and letters to parents for workshops, parent teacher 
conferences and the Discipline code. These resources are valuable in providing translations in languages such as 
Arabic, Bengali, Urdu, Albanian, Russian, Korean, Chinese,Spanish and Haitian Creole to name a few. School 
Personnel uses the valuable resources provided on the DOE Website –ENL Parents are also provided with written 
translations of documents and notifications. For example, Home Language Identification Surveys, Promotion in 
Doubt documents, Learning Environment Surveys and the ELL Parent Brochures. 
f. New York City School/ Parent Survey:The Parent Coordinator ensures that the parents understand the 
importance of the survey. In order to encourage parental participation, the Parent Coordinator writes a letter 
asking parents for their E-mail address. Parents who provide the Coordinator with their E-mails, receive her 
notices for workshops, weekly updates on school news and special events.  
g. As a school wide initiative, parents will receive school messages or special classroom teacher messages via the 
Blackboard Connect which is a telephone parent notification system. Teachers also communicate with parents via 
Dojo. This message is delivered in Spanish and English. The school also provides the parents with a monthly 
calendar in both English and Spanish. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Parents are informed at registration as well as during teacher meetings, about the importance of an updated 
emergency card with the names of siblings, alternative contact phone numbers like close family members and job 
numbers. Office staff ensures that all blue emergency cards are kept current. Additionally, the school uses Black Board 
Connect to deliver phone messages in various languages. In the event of an emergency, The Language Access 
Coordinator or a trained school personnel contacts The Translation and Interpretation unit to request the desired 
language. Once an interpreter is located, the caller will provide details as to the nature of the emergency. Once the 
parent has contacted the school, the LAC or trained school personnel will proceed to use the three way call phone 
service to connect the parent ,the interpreter and the school so that a conversation can proceed.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The school will ensure that all staff members will be made aware of the goal of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 
during staff meetings and staff development. The Language Access Coordinator and the ELL Coordinator will turnkey 
the language access information, policies and procedures and the distribution of Language Line Information. The staff 
will be informed of the importance of working closely with the LAC and ELL Coordinator so that parents who are in 
need of translation and interpretation services can receive it on a timely basis. Additionally, the office staff will 
distribute a procedural memo highlighting key points and resources available.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation by posting copies of the 
Chancellors Regulation A-663 and other notifications such as a Welcome poster, parents Bill of Rights, Parents guide 
to access language on the Parent bulletin board located in front of the school entrance. Also, the school will provide 
school security with a language ID guide so limited-English Proficient parents can receive information or services in 
their language of preference. The parents will also be offered a new parent orientation and be invited to curriculum 
night where they will be able to ask questions and share their concerns. The parents will also receive copies of the 
guide to language access. The Parents Association will offer monthly meetings where various topics of interests will be 
addressed. When available, the school will also use translated documents provided by The Department of Education 
website and services from the Translation and Interpretation unit or vendor. The parents are also welcomed to visit 
the Parent Coordinator's office where they will have access to a computer connected to the DOE website, bilingual 
dictionaries, brochures on all types of topics of interests for example, self help, health and how to help your child at 
home. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

As a new initiative, the school will gather feedback from limited-English proficient parents in regard to the language 
services they received . Parents will be provided with a yearly survey or questionnaire that will rate their language 
services. The results of the surveys will be used to improve language services. Additionally, the Parent 
Coordinator/LAC and the ENL Coordinator will continue to communicate with parents via e-mails, phone calls and 
face-to-face interactions. The feedback will improve communication with parents as well as serve as a tool for 
monitoring the quality of language services our school is providing.
