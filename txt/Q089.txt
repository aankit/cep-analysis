Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Vision  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

We envision P.S. 89Q to be a school community that exemplifies the best in teaching practices which will empower all 
students with the necessary critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills to be fully contributing 
members of society. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Mission  

Every student at P.S. 89Q will receive a solid foundation for learning through rigorous, Common Core aligned 
instruction in literacy and mathematics. We will build a community of learners where all members, staff, students and 
parents are actively engaged in the educational process. Critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills 
are developed through an enriched academic program that includes science, technology and the arts. We will create a 
positive, supportive educational environment that will develop all students into leaders who are life-long learners, 
ready for college, career and beyond. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Contextual Information About the School’s Community and its Unique/Important Characteristics 

● P.S. 89, is one of the largest elementary schools in New York City. It is situated in an area of Elmhurst, Queens, and 
comprised of a culturally diverse student population. The community is home to many new immigrants to the United 
States, which directly affects the language proficiency of our student body. Currently our school consists of an English 
Language Learner (ELL) population that is equal to 45% percent of our entire enrollment of approximately 2,000 
students.  

● Despite numerous challenges, our overall performance on the quality review report for 2015-2016 indicates that we 
have much to celebrate. Our area of celebration indicates that teachers use assessments that provide clear feedback 
to students. The use of varied assessments paves the way for student growth.  

● The School Quality Guide for 2017-18 shows great improvements in all Framework element scores. This indicates 
higher levels of trust, strong family-community ties, effective leadership, and collaborative teachers. Collaboration 
and teacher teams are a strong asset of PS 89. Our school's quality guide report also indicates that we received a 
score of well developed in teacher teams and leadership development. These achievements have been a result of our 
entire school community’s commitment to student growth and maintaining high expectations for academic 
excellence.  

● Although P.S. 89 has been standing for over 100 years in the Elmhurst community, we pride ourselves on the 
supportive, and child-centered learning environment that we have created for our students. This is also reflected in 
the Framework for Great Schools Report 2017-18 where high scores in safety and order, as well as social emotional 
learning have led to a score of 79 in Supportive Environment. Our attendance rate has been consistently above the 
95% range.  

● For the past fourteen (14) years, we have established a partnership with Teacher’s College Reading and Writing 
Project to support literacy instruction through professional development for our teachers and school leaders in order 
to improve the overall student academic achievement and standardized test scores. We provide teachers with 
professional development opportunities at Teacher's College of Columbia to ensure their professional growth. We 
also provide constant support to new teachers, in order to provide them with the learning tools they need to develop 
as new pedagogues. New Teacher Institute, Lead teachers by grade level 

● We have a long standing partnership with Child Center of NY (CCNY). This community based organization (CBO) 
provides after school, vacation and summer programs for our students. The program offers homework help, 
academic support, and enrichment activities such as dance, drama, and arts and crafts. They also provide 
workshops for parents and counseling referrals to families in need. The site director from CCNY sits on the School 
Leadership Team, and she works closely with the principal and administrators to develop and align programs that 
meet our students’ needs. 

● In an effort to build our Students with Disabilities' special social needs, we host an after school program called PS 
89 Pals which focuses on cultivating social skills among students with communicative needs. While 16% of our 
student population have special needs, 37% are in self-contained classrooms. They have multiple benefits from this 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

after school program. During the 2018-2019 school year we are implementing the Calming Center, where a SETTS 
provider will be working with children displaying academic as well as behavioral struggles.  

● In order to enrich the learning experience for students, there has been a great deal of emphasis in updating the 
school’s technology in both hardware and software. We have maintained technology in our of classrooms, by 
providing smartboards, macbook laptops, and iPads for use during the day as well as afterschool programs. We also 
make technology accessible in the English as a New Language (ENL) Lab, Special Education Teacher Support Services 
(SETSS) labs, and Library Media Center.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 89 has a great level of high needs students. 

English Language Learners - PS 89 has a 45% population of English Language Learner students. The specific needs for 
ELLS are targeted instruction and a child-centered approach for vocabulary acquisition. We have a variety of teaching 
models that are differentiated to fit their unique learning needs and we have recently implemented stand-alone 
periods to allow for explicit ENL instruction.  

Students with Disabilities - PS 89 has a 16% population of students with special needs. The specific needs for SWDs 
are rigorous, yet attainable instruction that is geared to their individual goals. 

 

 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

  PS 89’s School Quality Guide Report 2017 shows many areas for celebration. For example, in the category of 

Collaborative Teachers, there was a 93% positive response in Cultural Awareness and Inclusive Classroom 
Instruction. PS89 puts a large focus on parent teacher collaboration and there are several parent workshops 
that are hosted each month. PS89 also performed well in the area of Trust. Parent-teacher trust received a 
96% positive response and parent-principal trust had a positive response of 96%.  

  Another area for celebration can be found under Effective School Leadership, where there was a 95% positive 

response in Inclusive Leadership. This is a direct result of building strong family-community ties with 
consistent meetings to give feedback based on long term and short term goals. 

  While PS 89’s Framework for Great Schools Report 2017 was mostly positive, it did show areas of focus.  
o  The first area of concern is under the category of program coherence. There was a 79% positive 

response, which indicates that teachers feel that there is work to be done on curriculum choice and 
follow up. 

o  The next area of concern lies in the indicator Strong Family-Community Ties. Although there was a 

95% positive response on teacher outreach to parents, parent involvement in the school only

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
This year’s goal builds upon the work of 2017-18 by strategically targeting our English Language Learners (ELLs). 
Student data reflects that the English Language Learner (ELLs) subgroup performs significantly lower than our non-
ELLs. To deepen and broaden our commitment to closing the achievement gap, for the 2017-18 school year the ENL 
department will be supervised by our Assistant Principal who has previously served as an ENL teacher. Under his 
supervision, an ENL curriculum committee has been created to revise the curriculum units for the upcoming school 
year with a focus on ENL instruction. This year, our goal will be to continue to improve ENL instruction in order to 
accelerate student progress in this high needs subgroup. 

For several years a major area of concern has been the academic achievement of our English Language Learner 
subgroup. Historically, the English Language Learner subgroup has performed significantly lower on the New York 
State English Language Arts (NYS ELA) exam and the New York State Math exam.  

More recent data shows that there has been a shift in this trend. For example, in the 2017-2018 school year, ELLs 
performed 5% higher than they did the previous year on the NY ELA state test. ELLS also performed 6.4% higher than 
they did on the previous year's NY Math state test. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Goal #1: English Language Learners 

To continue to focus sharply on developing strategies to raise the achievement of English Language Learners in English 
Language Arts, teachers will utilize formative and summative assessments to provide targeted multiple entry points and 
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) strategies for ENLs so that by June 2019, the number of ENL students performing at 
Levels 3 and 4 in September 2018 will increase by ten (10) percent by the June TCRWP Reading Assessment.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

● Curriculum units of study in Reading and Writing will be 
revised monthly at ENL curriculum unit planning team meetings 
to include UDL strategies and scaffolds for English Language 
Learners 

● Assistant Principal with TESOL certification will be assigned to 
supervise the ENL Teachers in order to improve instructional 
methods and student outcomes 

● ENL teachers will continue to be included in all professional 
development workshops, including unit planning

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
This year’s goal builds upon the work of 2016-17 by continuing to purposely target our lowest performing students in 
English Language Arts. A significant number of our students perform far below grade level in ELA. To deepen and 
broaden our commitment to closing the achievement gap, we will provide targeted academic intervention services 
using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model within a supportive learning environment. 

Data from P.S. 89’s 2012-13 NYC Progress Report, 2013-14 School Quality Guide, and the Framework for Great 
Schools 2015 report all show positive trends for all students in ELA; however, we must continue to improve 
educational outcomes for ‘at-risk’ students in English Language Arts. The subgroups of English Language Learners 
(ELLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs) have historically been the majority of students performing at Level 1 in 
ELA at PS 89Q. In order to reduce the number of students performing at Level 1 in English Language Arts, we will 
continue to provide targeted Academic Intervention Services (AIS) programs within the school day using the Response 
to Intervention Model (RtI). Interventions following the Response to Intervention (RtI) plan occur in a three (3) tiered 
approach. Tier I interventions occur at the classroom level with the classroom teacher. At the Tier I level, lessons 
should be differentiated for students based on learning styles and instructional need. Teachers must insure that 
identified students are provided with Tier I interventions for a minimum of three (3) times each week. 

Tier I interventions are as follows: 

● Small group instruction such as strategy lessons, guided reading, guided writing, shared/close reading, component 
work, fluency, and word study 

Teachers will monitor the progress of students receiving Tier I interventions every six weeks. For this purpose, we 
have created an online progress monitoring system on the school website. The dates for Progress Monitoring are 
October 23, December 4, January 22, March 11 and May 6. Students who are progressing well in Tier I interventions 
will have those services reduced or removed. Students, who are not making progress with Tier I interventions, will be 
moved to Tier II interventions based on the outcome of a Pupil Personnel Committee (PPC) meeting. Tier II 
interventions will be scheduled for a minimum of three (3) times each week.  

Tier II interventions are as follows:  

● Lexia, Imagine Learning, RazKids, Rosetta Stone, Great Leaps, Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI),  

Student progress in Tier II interventions will be recorded on the school website, using a simple drop down menu in six-
week intervals. Students who are progressing well with Tier II interventions will have their services reduced or

Tier III interventions are as follows: 

● AIS reading, AIS math, At-risk speech, At-risk SETSS 

Students who are progressing well in Tier III interventions will have those services reduced or removed. Students, who 
are not making progress with Tier III interventions, will be referred for an educational evaluation based on the 
outcome of a Pupil Personnel Committee (PPC) meeting. We will also continue to track the performance of at risk 
students in ELA periodically to determine the effectiveness of our programs and interventions, so that we can add or 
revise services. We have, therefore, created this school goal to insure the continued academic improvement of at risk 
students in English Language Arts. This model for academic intervention insures that students are being educated in a 
supportive environment. Using Leader in Me which develops the 7 Habits of Happy Kids teachers provide academic 
intervention in classrooms and within a school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their 
teachers and peers.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Goal #2: English Language Arts - Lowest third  

To continue to improve educational outcomes for students performing in the lowest third in English Language Arts, 
including ELLs and SWDs, teachers will provide targeted academic intervention in a supportive learning environment 
based on summative and formative data so that by June 2018, the number of students in grades K-5 performing at 
Level 1 on TCRWP Reading Assessments in September will decrease by 10% as measured by the June 2018 TCRWP 
Reading Assessment.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

● Students who were designated as Promotion in Doubt for the 
2015-16 school year will be identified and will be provided with 
Tier I interventions 

● Academic intervention services (AIS) are provided using 
Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) for students who are 
performing well below grade level in grades. Administrators 
utilize summative and formative data for all students to 
determine eligibility for AIS and to create AIS rosters based on 
student need. 

● After school programs will continue to be created based on the 
results of summative and formative data for students in grades 3-
5.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

This year’s goal builds upon the work of 2016-17. At the end of the 2012-13 school year, the school community had 
come to a consensus that the Everyday Mathematics, which we had been using for many years, was no longer 
adequate in meeting the CCLS. Therefore, a committee of teachers was formed to research and review Math 
programs with the objective of finding the best program to provide students with the instruction necessary to meet 
the higher demands of the CCLS. The curriculum committee chose GoMath!, which was also the program 
recommended by the DOE. The materials were purchased, and the teachers received professional development, so 
that the program could be implemented beginning with the 2013-14 school year. After receiving the results of the 
NYS Math Exam for 2013-14, there were some concerns. For the first time in many years our students progress in 
Mathematics was lower than the students progress in ELA. An analysis of the data found that In terms of math 
student progress, our school fell within 40.6 percentile of the “Peer Range” and 39.5 percentile of the “City Range”. 
We were able to earn only 6.7 out of 16.7 available points. 

Upon further analysis, we found that it was primarily our lowest third and special education students that brought 
down our average in math. We fell within 28.9 percentile of the “Peer Range” and 28.1 percentile of the “City Range”. 
We were able to earn only 4.8 out of 16.7 available points in this category. While the 2013-14 School Quality 
Snapshot, showed an achievement rate of 42% which was 3% higher than the city average, we were 2% below the 
district average of 44%. Also, when looking at student progress in Mathematics, for the same period each of our 
subgroups ENL, SWD and Lowest Performing Students were rated with two (2) bars which is just fair. After the second 
year of GoMath implementation, there have been more positive results. The 2014-15 School Quality Snapshot shows 
the Math performance rate at 45% which was 6% greater than the city average of 39% and 2% greater than the 
district average of 43%. Furthermore, when looking at the growth on the state Math tests, the ENL subgroup received 
three (3) bars which is a rating of "good", and the SWDs and Lowest Third groups received four (4) bars which is a 
rating of "Excellent". Therefore, in order to continue this trend in student performance and progress in Mathematics, 
we have created this goal. For many years the focus at PS 89 has been in ELA. Teachers have participated in 
collaborative planning around ELA instruction. Our teachers will continue to work collaboratively to support student 
achievement in Mathematics.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Goal #3: Mathematics 

To focus sharply on developing strategies to raise the achievement of all students in Mathematics, including ELLS and 
SWDs, teachers will work collaboratively to utilize Universal Design for Learning (UDL) strategies in GoMath! instruction

to provide multiple entry points including scaffolds and extensions, to insure that all students are provided with rigorous

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

● We will continue to contract with the Learning Leaders 
organization to recruit and train 10 additional Learning Leaders 
for the 2017-18 school year. The projected 10 new members, 
added to the 25 current Learning Leaders at PS 89, will provide 
us with a total of 35 active parent volunteers. 

● In order to provide parents with information and support, a 
parent survey will be distributed at the first Family Night asking 
parents about their interests and needs. Based on the responses, 
a minimum of one (1) targeted Parent Workshop will be held 
each month.  

 

- In order to increase the level of parent engagement Parent 
Workshops are being conducted by school staff and outside 
agencies on average four (4) times each month. Topics include: 
Nutrition, Literacy, Health, Homework, Attendance, and 
Preparing for Parent Teacher Conferences. 

● We will continue to provide Adult ENL classes, 3 times each 
week, and First Steps Parent-Toddler Language Intervention 
Program for Parents with 2-3 year olds, each week. 

● In addition to scheduled Parent Teacher Conferences, parents 
will be invited to each classroom a minimum of two (2) times 
each year for unit or holiday celebrations and/or workshops. An 
online system of recording and reporting these invitations will be 
created and monitored by the Parent Liaison/ The Parent 
Coordinator will record these events on the parent calendar and 
a copy of the calendar will be given to the school safety agents. 

●  The Parent Coordinator will continue to develop methods for 
informing Staff and Parents about Parent Involvement Activities 
occurring in the school throughout the year. She will develop a 
Parent Coordinator Newsletter which will inform parents and 
staff of parent involvement activities in the school and utilize the 
school website to send electronic communication to the parents.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 The school has an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and School Leadership Team (SLT). We also have 
successfully recruited and trained parent volunteers for the past several years through the Learning Leader Program. 
Currently, 25 Learning Leaders volunteer from 2-3 days each week, assisting teachers in the classrooms, and/or 
assisting office and administrative staff. A Title I Parent Involvement Committee supports programs such as morning 
Adult ENL Classes for parents and the Parent-Toddler Language Intervention Program. Teachers reach out to parents 
through a home-school communication folder, and inform parents of students strengths and areas of focus monthly 
on progress reports and/or report cards. Providing parents with frequent feedback on student performance along 
with face-to-face meetings during Tuesday’s parent engagement time resulted in a 92% positive response on the 
Framework for Great Schools 2015 report. However, on the School Quality Snapshot, Strong Family-Community Ties 
only received a 79% approval rating, earning just two (2) bars which is considered "fair." As a result, we will continue 
to focus on improving parent involvement and have created this goal. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
  

Goal #4: Parent Involvement 

Through active outreach efforts, staff members will seek to make the school a more hospitable and welcoming 
environment for parents. These efforts will lead to an increase in parent involvement in school activities, so that by 
June, 2017 the percentage of positive responses on the the School Survey on parent involvement will increase by 5%, as 
indicated on the Framework for Great Schools Report 2017.

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

When students are identified to be in temporary housing, the school's guidance counselors reach out to the families 
to determine their needs. We have in the past assisted with providing food, clothing and school supplies as needed. 
Counseling services and academic support are offered as well as referrals to social service agencies. We also offer 
child care after school through the CC-NY CBO. 

 

Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your school

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
● Each year the administration receives hundreds of prospective candidates for open positions. Resumes are carefully 
reviewed and hiring fairs are attended to recruit from the pool of candidates. The hiring manager chooses the 
brightest and most promising applicants to interview at Level I. Those showing the greatest potential complete writing 
samples to show their knowledge and basic writing skills, if exemplary, they are moved to Level II. Level II candidates 
then interview with the principal who further assesses the candidates’ skills, knowledge and potential. If candidates 
pass the Level II phase of the interview process, they are invited to conduct a demonstration lesson. During the 
lesson, the principal and assistant principals assess the candidates skills and potential in order to determine whether 
or not they are the right fit for our school. Many qualified teachers are interested in our school due to the level of 
support provided, the school’s ‘A’ performance rating, and the professional development offered. Choosing 
exemplary faculty to join the professional development staff as P.S. 89 furthers the professional climate and deepens 
our learning community.  

● To support new teachers in the readers, writers, and mathematics workshop we have created a New Teacher 
Institute. The New Teacher Institute (NTI) provides an intensive two-day overview of the curriculum and expectations. 
Support continues with a yearlong, New Teacher Professional Development course, that meets for two periods each 
week. The course explores each component of the workshops more thoroughly in order to deepen the teachers’ 
understanding. The New Teacher Professional Development groups are divided by grade level, K - 2, and 3- 5 to allow 
for more differentiated, grade-specific support during Professional Development meetings.  

 

● We have made a concerted effort to build capacity in our school by encouraging leadership among teachers. 
Teachers are selected to create labsites for their colleagues learning and professional growth. Teachers who exhibit 
exemplary practices, are videotaped in action, and the videos are made available to the rest of the staff on the 
school’s staff website. This video library is an excellent resource and serves to celebrate the exemplary efforts of staff 
members. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● PS 89 continues to implement a focused and ongoing professional development program in literacy and 
Mathematics. We continually gather data from the staff regarding their needs in professional development in order to 
improve the quality of instruction.  

 

● All classroom and OTP teachers will continue to be afforded the opportunity to participate cycles of professional 
development, around various topics, provided by TCRWP staff developers. 

● PS 89’s professional development is aligned with the goals outlined in our CEP. 

 

● Classroom lab sites are used on every grade (K-5) to demonstrate and practice new initiatives and instructional 
methods. 

 

● A climate of inquiry learning is encouraged among pedagogues with all teachers participating in Professional 
Learning Committees (PLCs). They conduct a study into an area of mutual interest that aligns with the school’s goals. 
Using data collected in their own classrooms, the effects of instructional practices are studied and plans are created 
to implement methods, which prove to be effective. The PLCs meet three times a month on Mondays during 
extended day.  

 

● Teachers, who do not possess the necessary certification in order to meet the High-Quality Teacher standards in 
core academic subjects, will receive support in the form of information, reminders, and compensation to obtain the 
necessary requirements. Teachers, who are not successful at achieving the necessary certification, will be placed in 
positions for which they are highly qualified. This will insure that all High-Quality Teachers teaching in all core subjects 
for the 2016-17 school year. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
All teachers, including ENL, Special Education teachers, AIS teachers and Speech Teachers participate in rigorous 
ongoing CCLS aligned professional development during monthly grade level Unit Planning Team meetings. Teachers 
also receive cycles of Professional Development provided by Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) 
Staff Developers. Dedicated professional development cycles are created for specific groups such as ESL teachers and 
second grade teachers based on their professional needs. Many teachers attend Calendar Day Workshops at TCRWP 
in areas of interest and need. The information gleaned at the calendar days is disseminated to the other teachers via 
the AP of Curriculum and/or Instructional Coaches. In-house professional development is provided on Monday 
afternoons based on staff needs as determined by the Professional Development Committee. The Professional 
Development Committee consist of an equal number of teachers and administrators. All teachers also participate in 
PLCs. 

Paraprofessionals attend Monday professional development sessions on various topics, including but not limited to, 
Paraprofessional responsibilities, how to effectively implement Behavioral Intervention Plans, SESIS-basics, Encounter 
Attendance, and helping students achieve IEP goals.

Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
In order to assist preschool children transition from early childhood programs to the elementary school program, our 
Parent Coordinator (PC) reaches out to the preschools that historically have sent us the majority of our incoming 
Kindergarten students. The PC invites parents to workshops that provide information to parents on preparing their 
children for elementary school. This year parents of prospective Kindergarten students will be invited to an open 
house in February. During the registration process, the registration staff provides additional guidance to parents 
regarding strategies for helping their child prepare for Kindergarten. The principal holds a parent Kindergarten 
Orientation meeting every year in June. At this meeting the parents are provided with detailed information about the 
transition process. Every parent and child receives a welcome packet, which includes a parent information booklet, 
student coloring book and sample summer activities that can be completed in order to prepare the child for 
elementary school. The activities include alphabet chart, simple math sheets, and fine motor practice tracing sheets. 
During the June Orientation, families were escorted on a school tour by the Kindergarten teachers. Students from Big 
Apple and Little Friends Pre-K programs, visited P.S. 89 with their teachers. The Pre-K students were given a tour of 
the building and participated in a read aloud in a Kindergarten classroom. Students’ cumulative records are sent to 
the school with preschool assessments included so that Kindergarten teachers have some knowledge about their 
student’s developmental level upon entry. If Kindergarten students are having difficulty adjusting to elementary 
school, guidance counselors or administrators provide support to students and families and will often contact the 
preschool programs for additional information. 

PS 89 is proud to offer an early intervention service to siblings of currently enrolled students. Siblings, who are two to 
three years old, are able to attend our First Steps Parent-Toddler Language Intervention Program . This program 
provides parents and/or guardians with toddlers the opportunity to come to school each week to play and learn 
together. The program, which is run by the Parent Coordinator, uses volunteer facilitators to promote quality 
language activities between parents and children. The facilitators utilize toys and books to model interactions that will 
build vocabulary and expressive language for the children. Sessions are conducted in the home language whenever 
possible in order to maximize transfer of skills. The program provides a lending library of toys and books for the 
parent to take home each week, so that they may apply the same techniques that they observed with the First Steps 
facilitator . Enrollment in the program was 50 for the 2015-16 school year. Data shows that students who were in the 
First Steps Language Intervention Program perform at levels 3 and 4 on TCRWP reading assessments in grades K-2.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
● Assessments are a key component of the instructional program at PS 89. We regularly administer assessments that 
align with our core curriculum and have created data collection systems that allow the monitoring of student 
progress. We monitor student progress in reading quarterly, writing triennially in three genres, and mathematics 
triennially.  

● A Math Curriculum Team was created for the 2015-16 school year to collect and analyze assessment data in 
Mathematics and to provide remediation packets as needed. This team will be in place again for the 2016-17 school 
year. The team was divided into subgroups by grade level. They analyze the GoMath benchmark assessements and 
play a crucial role in helping to determine program effectiveness. They present their findings to the administrative 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

cabinet, so that informed decisions can be made based to revise curriculum implementation and or instructional 
strategies as needed.  

● The MOSL committee was formed to explore the various assessment options available for selection for this year and 
will continue to meet for this function. The MOSL Committee will carefully review the MOSL data from the previous 
year, and consider it along with the instructional programs and student outcomes. The Committee, which includes 
four (4) assistant principals and four (4) teachers, collaborates to select the assessments that align with our school-
wide goals and our shared beliefs about how students learn best. After careful consideration, the MOSL Committee 
present their recommendations for multiple measures of student learning to the principal for approval. 

● The principal will publish the MOSL selections in the weekly newsletter so that the school community will be 
informed of the decision in a timely manner. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

IV. Adoption  

This school parental involvement policy has been developed jointly with, and agreed on with, parents of children 
participating in Title 1, Part A programs, as evidenced by the P.S. 89Q School Leadership Committee agenda. This 
policy has been adopted by P.S. 89Q – The Elmhurst School and will be in effect for the period of 2016-17 school year. 
The school will distribute this policy to all parents of students participating Title I, Part A in their language of 
understanding. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

It is stated in the P.S. 89Q mission statement that “all members, staff, students and parents are actively engaged in 
the educational process.” To ensure that parents are actively engaged, P.S. 89Q has formed a Parent Involvement 
Committee comprised of parents, parent coordinator and Assistant Principal. 

I. General Expectations 

P.S. 89Q agrees to implement the following requirements with its Parent Involvement Committee: 

● Plan and monitor programs, activities and procedures for parent involvement in collaboration with parents 

● Meet the requirements of section 1118(b) of ESSA and create a school-parent compact consistent with 1118(d) of 
ESSA in order to strengthen the involvement of families  

● Ensure that the Parent Involvement Policy is included in the Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) 

● Ensure that all parents are informed of parent involvement activities and are provided with copies of the school-
parent compact and parent involvement policy in the home language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

● Ensure that parents are involved in the determination of how Title I, Part A funds for parent involvement are spent 

● Use the definition of parent involvement as a guide to monitor all programs, activities and procedures: 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

PS 89Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Definition:  

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

Parent Involvement means the participation of parents in regular, two-way, and meaningful communication with the 
school. Parents are an integral partner in their child’s learning, actively involved in their child’s education and are 
encouraged to participate in decision-making and advisory committees at the school. 

II. Implementation 

1. P.S. 89Q has established a Title I Parent Involvement Committee. This committee is responsible for the creation of 
the Parent Involvement Policy; therefore, parents are involved in the development of the policy. 

2. P.S. 89Q involves parents in school review and improvement by having parents complete School Surveys, 
participate in school leadership, participate in the parent involvement committee and volunteer as Learning Leaders. 

3. P.S. 89Q will inform parents of current units of study in reading, writing, science, social studies, and math through a 
centrally located bulletin board, as well as, a monthly curricular calendar. The school will inform parents of new units 
of study and teachers will invite parents to end of unit curriculum celebrations throughout the year.  

4. P.S. 89Q will review the School Survey results to determine the effectiveness of its parental involvement policy for 
all parents , especially for parents of limited income, special needs, limited English proficiency, limited literacy and 
including all ethnic groups. The results of this survey will be used to plan parental involvement activities and programs 
to meet their needs. 

5. The school website www.ps89q.org provides important information to parents in an electronic format. 

6. P.S. 89Q will build school and parent capacity by providing the following activities: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

● Inform parents of state academic standards, benchmarks, standardized testing requirements, and promotional 
criteria. Parents also receive academic feedback on a monthly basis either through report cards, or student progress 
reports. Parents are assisted in creating a NYC Schools Account to access their child’s information online.  

● Provide materials and training to foster literacy and parental involvement through programs such as: Learning 
Leaders, First Steps Parent Toddler Program, Adult ENL, Math and Literacy Workshops, and library programs.  

● Coordinate and integrate parent involvement programs with pre-school students: kindergarten orientation, First 
Steps Parent Toddler Program, inviting Universal Pre-K parents to attend P.S. 89Q parent workshops, and Pre-K visits. 

● P.S. 89Q makes every effort to insure that information is made available in the parents’ language of understanding 
through written translation of fliers, memos, parent notices and provides oral interpretation during parent workshops 
and meetings. The school has created an in-house translation & interpretation committee comprised of volunteers 
and professionals. In addition, P.S. 89Q utilizes the DOE over-the-phone interpretation services.  

● PS 89Q continues to maintain and expand its collection of native language literature to promote family literacy. 

 

III. Discretionary Activities 

P.S. 89 will continue to develop and maintain model approaches for improving parent involvement such as: 

● Creating and maintaining a parent lending library 

● First Steps Parent-Toddler Program to improve the language development of preschool age siblings 

● In-House Translation & Interpretation Team to assist with communication between home and school. 

● Adult ENL / Literacy 

 

School-Parent Compact 

Mission Statement 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Every student at P.S. 89Q will receive a solid foundation for learning through rigorous, Common Core aligned 
instruction in literacy and mathematics. We will build a community of learners where all members, staff, students and 
parents are actively engaged in the educational process. Critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills 
are developed through an enriched academic program that includes science, technology and the arts. We will create a 
positive, supportive educational environment that will develop all students into leaders who are lifelong learners, 
ready for college, career and beyond.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

PS 89Q utilizes the data analysis tool EDAT to keep track of the academic growth and 
achievement of all students, including ELL subgroups. The data yielded from the EDAT help us 
to analyze student progress in their academic areas including English as a New Language (ENL) 
and allows teachers to design effective instructional programs and/or intervention to address the 
needs of those students. 
 
EDAT data reveal that our English Language Learners made remarkable progress in the spring 
2017 NYSESLAT: 58 (7.2%) ELLs achieved Commanding level and the majority of our ELLs 
(451) obtained Expanding level. 563 test takers scored high in Speaking modality; 146 scored 
high in Listening, 263 scored high in Reading and 188 scored high in Writing. 187 ELLs (35%) 
advanced 1 or more proficiency levels. However, the data also indicate that 324 ELLs remained 
at same proficiency level. 146 ELLs performed low in Writing modality. 
 
 Based on this data analysis, the goal of our Title III program is to enhance and/or accelerate 
literacy and English language skills for our English language learners through differentiated 
instruction and accelerated learning to support them in their academic learning and help to ensure 
that they are on track to become college and career ready as described in the Chancellor’s 
initiatives and the Learning  Standards. 
 
The following supplementary programs and materials have been carefully reviewed and selected 
to target the needs of our ELLs. None of the materials, including Lexia, Rosetta Stone, laptops 
and iPads have been purchased using Title III funds. We purchased all these materials using 
school funds. Title III funds have been used only to pay teachers per session. 
 
 
Saturday Program 
 
Our Saturday Program is scheduled to start on November 12, 2018 and end on March 22, 2019. 
The program will run for 14 sessions, with four (4) hours of instruction and learning each 
session. Instruction will be provided between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. There will be eight (8) 
3rd grade classes, with a maximum of fifteen(15) students in each class. Eight (8) certified ENL 
teachers and one (1) certified Common Branch technology teacher will be working in the 
program. This program is aiming to improve the English Language communication and literacy 
skills for our English Language Learners in grade 3 who scored at Risk level 1 on the most 
recent Teachers College Reading Assessment  and  low to medium in the NYSESLAT modalities 
of Reading & Writing. 
 
Students will be provided with: 
●       90 minutes of instruction using Lexia Blended Learning Platform 
●       90 minutes of Differentiated Math Workshop

Our After School Program is scheduled to start on October 19, 2018 and to end on May 3, 2019. 
Classes meet between 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. The 
program will run for 73 sessions, with two (2) hours of instruction and learning each session. 
There will be eight (8) classes, with a maximum of fifteen (15) students in each class. Eight (8) 
certified ENL teachers and one (1) Common Branch certified technology teacher will be working 
in the program.  The program is geared towards 4th and 5th grade ELLs who scored level 1 on 
the ELA and/ or Math state tests. 
 
In the after school program, students will be provided with: 
●       60 minutes of instruction using Lexia Blended Learning Platform 
●       60 minutes of Differentiated Math Workshop 
 
 
Lexia Blended Learning Platform 
 
The goal of our After School and Saturday  Lexia Program is to enhance the English language 
communication and literacy skills for our English Language Learners. 
 
Teachers in Saturday Lexia Program will focus on improving student’s oral language, phonics, 
vocabulary, spelling and writing skills. Teachers will review student’s NYSESLAT subtest 
scores and students’ current reading levels and writing samples to determine the needs of the 
students. Students will also be evaluated through Lexia online diagnostic assessment tools, which 
will help to determine their most appropriate language comprehension and phonics skill 
development level.  
 
Teachers will plan or design small groups and skill targeted lessons as determined by the 
assessment data to address the individual needs and/or varying proficiency levels of the ELLs. 
 
In order to make learning more meaningful and comprehensible for our ELLs, teachers will also 
adopt blended teaching/learning models such as small group, differentiated instruction, student-
led conversation, discussion and/or independent work with teacher coaching and guiding,  Each 
lesson will be scaffolded, where appropriate, with  pictures, rebus, modeling, repetition, acting 
out, visualizing, relating to or building background knowledge, cloze reading, explicit 
vocabulary teaching in context, etc.  Home language support will also be provided to our ELLs 
since many teachers working in the program speak more than one language.  Peer support system 
such as partnership reading and writing will also be established to assist students in expanding 
their English reading and writing skills. 
 
After teacher-led small group instruction, students will work independently in on-line activities 
that are differentiated based on their individual needs where they will have an opportunity to 
apply and practice the strategies and skills learned in small group instruction. 
 
Students’ progress will be closely monitored through teacher-student conferencing, class work, 
teacher assessment and the Lexia on-line assessment system.

●       Lexia Direct/Differentiated Teaching Lessons 
●       Books in different genres 
 
Independent Reading session: 
 
Students are scheduled to read independently for one hour. During the independent reading, 
teachers will pull students for guided reading and individual conferencing, focusing on areas 
students need to improve and assess student understanding and engagement. Teachers will match 
students with just right books from the school’s library, model for them different reading 
strategies and encourage them to implement taught reading strategies to build stamina. 
 
Differentiated Math Program: 
 
Last year, our ENL students struggled with the state Math test. To address this, we will add a 
math component to our Saturday and After School programs. We will invite ENL students who 
scored level one and level two in Math to attend the Saturday School Math Workshop. The goal 
of the math workshop is, in addition to helping students with the math content,  to help them with 
content language and word problems. In order to achieve this goal, a team of teachers analyzed 
student math data and created math packets based on individual student needs. Math packets 
used in the program are completely aligned to New York State Math Learning Standards and are 
specifically designed to cater to individual student’s needs. 
 
During the math workshop, our teachers will utilize ENL strategies to provide scaffolded 
instruction to our students. Content vocabulary will be taught through interactive math activities 
and resources. Students will be provided with the opportunity to engage with their peers as well 
as with the teacher. Language functions and structures will be incorporated in the context of the 
entire lesson.  
 
Assessment of student progress will be conducted throughout the workshop. Teachers will pull 
students individually or in small groups to provide targeted instruction based on their assessment. 
Results will also be shared with classroom teachers to afford the classroom teachers the 
opportunity to follow up with their students. 
 
Mondo Newcomers Program 
 
The goal of our 2018-2019 Mondo Newcomers Program is to develop and/or improve the 
English language communication and literacy skills for our English Language Learners in 
Grades 1-5, who have been in the United States school system for fewer than one year and 
scored at Entering or Emerging Level in the New York State Identification Test for English 
Language Learners (NYSITELL). 
 
 Mondo Newcomers Program is scheduled to start on October 19, 2018 and to end on May 3, 
2019.  The program will be implemented on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 2:30 
p.m.-4:30 p.m. The duration of the program will be 73 sessions, with two (2) hours of instruction 
and learning each session. There will be two (2) classes. Each class will have about fifteen (15) 
newcomer ELLs from the same grade level or two contiguous grades. The classes will be taught 
by two (2) certified ENL teachers. 
 
To facilitate student’s language acquisition and vocabulary development, the ENL teachers will 
scaffold each lesson by utilizing a wide variety of ENL strategies such as Total Physical

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Response, Language Experience Approach, Cooperative Learning,  Modeling, pantomiming, 
Interactive Writing, Shared Reading and Writing. Comprehensible input that will help to make 
the language and content more accessible to students such as  vocabulary cards with pictures, 
Read-Aloud pocket chart, Shared Reading chart, visuals, realia, manipulatives, music, 
dramatizing, oral language picture cards and digital resources, including Smart Boards, 
document camera, Read/Sing-along technology-based program, will be utilized in teaching to 
promote the development of student’s English vocabulary, Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing skills. 
 
At the beginning of the program, the ENL teachers will review the student’s NYSITELL or 
student’s NYSESLAT performance in the modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing and administer a diagnostic assessment to identify the individual needs of each ELL. 
Small group instruction will, hence, be designed to address the diverse needs of the students. 
Throughout the duration of the program, teachers will regularly assess the students’ needs and 
progress through a variety of effective assessment tools such as teacher-student conferencing, 
teacher observation, student’s class work and participation, benchmark text level assessments, 
etc. The ongoing assessment data will help teachers to make or tailor their Instructional decisions 
to target the changing needs of the students. 
 
To effectively monitor student’s growth in their English language learning, teachers will 
establish a portfolio for each student to keep track of their performance. The portfolio will 
contain student’s class work, teacher-student conferencing notes, writing samples, benchmark 
text assessment levels, and other formative assessments.  The ENL teachers will use these 
assessment data to design or modify lessons for the students. 
 
The Materials used in Mondo Newcomers Program 
 
●       Mondo Oral and Literacy Program 
●        Shared reading books in different genres 
 
The technology-based interactive program, Rosetta Stone (for children), will also be used as 
needed by students who might need additional support or reinforcement in practicing what they 
have learned in small group instruction. We will use the program mainly for students who scored 
Entering level on the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT.   The program is not a standalone program. It 
will be used as a platform for students to practice what they have learned during the mini lesson. 
Teacher, on a regular basis, will stop students and, based on his/her assessment of the student, 
provide additional activities/resources. 
 
In order to foster their language development in a non-threatening environment,  home language 
support will be available for all ELLs, especially the newcomer ELLs, in our supplementary 
program.  Many teachers working in the program speak more than one language. Instruction in 
content and language will be supported with home language, where appropriate, to make 
learning more accessible for students. Furthermore, Newcomer ELLs will be supported in a 
buddy system or partnership with students who speak the same home language. Instructional 
materials have been carefully selected to reflect student’s diverse cultural backgrounds. School 
library also contains books of various cultures in different languages such as Spanish, Chinese, 
Korean, Bengali, Urdu, Arabic, etc. Students will be provided with the opportunity to borrow 
books from the library.

P.S.89 values the communication with parents and families of all students. Parent’s strong 
support and active involvement in their child’s education plays a vital role in the child’s success 
both in and outside school. Teachers at our school keep close contact with parents through a 
variety of communication channels such as school website, emails, letters/notes, phone calls 
and/or teacher-parent conferences. Parents are notified regularly about meetings and educational 
workshops via home letters, monthly calendars, telephone calls, school phone messenger, 
community bulletin boards, signs and flyers. All written communication is provided in English, 
and translated in the covered languages of the community including Spanish, Chinese, etc. 
Furthermore, a translation team has been established to help provide parents with the utmost 
support and assistance. Interpreters are available for all workshops and meetings conducted at 
school. 
 
The school’s Parent Coordinator, Mayra Soto, is proficient in English and Spanish. To further 
support student progress, every month our Parent Coordinator, with the support of the Staff 
Developers, conducts workshops for parents on Literacy and Mathematics skills. Workshops on 
different topics such as Go Math, reading strategies, nutrition, diabetes, cancer awareness, 
immigration, New York City School Account, school attendance, safety, etc. are also offered to 
parents.  The workshops are usually held in the morning from 8:30 -9:30. Moreover, parents will 
be provided the opportunity to attend Adult ENL classes three days a week on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday from 7:00 -7:45 am (pending funding). There will be two Adult ENL 
classes with 25 students per class. The classes will be taught by two certified ENL teachers. This 
program usually starts in December and ends in May, altogether 55 sessions. 
 
In addition, ENL teachers conduct various parents’ workshops throughout the school year in 
literacy addressing such topics as familiarizing parents with the school system, the ENL and 
Dual Language programs, ENL/ELA standards and assessments for ELLs, and strategies that 
parents can use to help children at home. Furthermore, teachers meet with parents individually to 
discuss their child’s language acquisition and academic progress and needs every Tuesday

afternoon during Parent Outreach time. Teachers who work in the supplementary after-school 
and Saturday programs also meet with parents during Parent Outreach time on Tuesday 
afternoon to discuss their child’s progress in the program. 
 
Our parents remain actively involved in the school’s decision-making process. The Title I Parent 
Involvement Committee regularly meets to develop and evaluate Title I services; parents are also 
members of the School Leadership Team and participate in scheduled meetings; they provide 
input on the selection of curriculum, instructional materials for students, and assist in aligning 
the budget. The parent attendance rate at our monthly Parents’ Association meetings is extremely 
high.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs are Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project 
(TCRWP) unit assessments, teacher-student conferences, end of unit assessments, pre-unit and post-unit on demand writing, 
teacher created assessments such as checklists, exit slips, etc. 
 
 TCRWP Reading Assessment is  an efficient method of assessing readers in letter naming, letter/sound recognition, sight 
words, decoding, reading comprehension and fluency. This tool is used to identify patterns in student's reading behaviors and 
student's strengths and weaknesses in the area of reading, and places students in the most appropriate instructional and 
independent level of reading texts. TCRWP Writng Assessment evaluates student's writing skills, which includes components 
such as structure, development and language conventions. Teachers record the students' assessment results,  which are then 
entered onto our online database system. The school's data specialist creates reports using the TCRWP data and merges that 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

information with other available reports such as ELL proficiency levels, NYSESLAT scores, NYS ELA scores, NYS Math 
scores,  years in NYC school system, in-house assessments, etc. This allows us to quickly identify student's learning needs and 
to adjust instruction accordingly.  For example, the analysis of our first grade ELLs performance in Period 1 TCRWP reading 
assessment reveals that students reading at Pre-A level  were having difficulties in phonemic awareness, phonetic skills and 
recognition of sight words. Based on the findings, intervention services such as small group instruction targeting phonic skills 
and sight words were designed and implemented. As a result, Period 2 TCRWP reading assessment of this group of ELLs 
demonstrated that 76.5% of them improved their literacy skills by moving up one or more reading levels. Ongoing assessments 
such as teacher-student conferences, unit assessments, checklists, on demand writing and exit slips also provide effective 
information and feedback from students about their learning strengths and needs, which teachers use to inform their 
instructional decision. 
 
 The Dual Language Spanish program assesses students through EL SOL, Estrellita, Rigby PM (Programa De Evaluacion). 
Teachers utilize the assessment results to monitor student performance and guide instructional planning for the ELLs in the 
program.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To most effectively support and educate our ELLs, P.S. 89Q has created and maintained a comprehensive data portal 
where  formative and  summative assessment data for all students from Kindergarten to grade 5, including ELLs, such as 
Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project unit assessments, In-house math benchmark assessments,  NYS ELA scores, NYS 
Math scores and NYSESLAT performance levels are all integrated. Students' performance on each item of the NY State ELA and 
NY State Math assessments are carefully reviewed and analyzed. The data portal also tracks individual student's 
progress/performance horizontally at current grade level and vertically from grade to grade. Teachers utilize the data to group 
students with similar academic needs and tailor instruction to meet their needs.  In addition to assessment data, the data 
portal provides information on student's class assignments, student's  ENL levels and services, students with special needs 
(SWD) designations, at-risk students, and various intervention services that students receive.    
 
 PS 89Q continues to maintain an E-Learning portal which contains detailed information on literacy units, math units, content 
areas  for each grade level and a variety of other educational resources such as read-aloud resources, writing resources, 
technology, testing, library, etc. The E-Learning portal enables teachers to have a better understanding of the strategies, skills, 
concepts that students are required to learn and master in the surrounding grades. Teachers, therefore, can plan their 
instruction more effectively for their students.   
 
 To further support our data driven instructional planning, teachers meet collaboratively and horizontally by grade level once a 
month to plan for upcoming units of study in reading and writing. Teachers review, discuss and revise curriculum to address 
the needs of their students.  During the Professional Learning Cycle (PLC) time on Monday afternoon, teachers work with their 
colleagues by grade level and/or vertically across grade levels in small groups to research best instructional practices for their 
students.  A weekly common prep period is scheduled for each grade when classroom teachers and service providers such as 
ENL teachers can meet to discuss student's progress and plan for lessons collaboratively. A weekly common prep period is also 
programmed for all ENL teachers across grade levels in the ENL program. ENL teachers meet regularly during common prep 
time to discuss and share best instructional strategies. 
 
 In addition, Title III supplemental Literacy and Math programs such as Lexia Blended Learning Platform, Achievement 3000 
Literacy Program, Differentiated Math Program, Mondo Oral Language and Reading Program, and LEAP Literacy program are 
implemented both after school and on Saturdays to further support the diverse needs of our students.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
 
 In order to accurately identify student's baseline, progress and areas of need, P.S. 89Q uses a variety of 
summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments such as Teacher's College Reading and Writing benchmark 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

assessments, pre-unit and post-unit on demand writing, end of unit assessments, in-house math benchmark assessments, New 
York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), New York State English Language Arts Exam, and New 
York State Mathematics Exam. 
 
 Teacher's College (TC) Reading and Writing benchmark assessments are administered four times a school year. The first TC 
benchmark assessments are administered at the beginning of the school year to evaluate and gather information on students 
reading and writing levels as well as student's learning strengths and needs. Subsequent assessments are implemented 
periodically to continue to measure student achievement and diagnose areas of deficiency. Math benchmark assessments are 
administered three times a year, respectively in September, January and June. Teachers use the information collected from 
the first benchmark assessments as a baseline to monitor student progress and plan for differentiated/small group instruction. 
Teachers of ELLs also review student's performance in the four modalities of NYSESLAT (Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing), the item skills analysis of student's performance in NYS ELA and NYS Math exams, and use the data to form needs-
based groups, and tailor instruction to match student's needs. 
 
 Before launching a new unit of study, a pre-unit on demand writing is administered to students to assess their prior 
knowledge about the topic and a post-unit on demand writing is administered to measure student's progress. Teacher created 
unit assessments also provide important diagnostic information about student's success in that unit. 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 To ensure that every student receive a solid foundation for learning through rigorous, standards aligned curriculum and be 
provided with every opportunity to success,  school leadership convenes on a weekly basis to discuss curriculum, student 
progress, review student's formative and summative assessment results, and design necessary intervention programs for 
students identified as "at risk". 
 
Teachers, including ENL teachers, meet with their academy and/or grade supervisors regularly to discuss instruction, individual 
student's progress and appropriate academic intervention actions for students at risk. Academic intervention services are 
customized to target student's individual needs.  For example, Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are provided to ELLs in all 
grades who performed at level 1 and level 2 in TC Reading and Writing Project benchmark assessments for a minimum of three 
times a week.  Based on student needs and learning styles, small group and/or individualized instruction in phonics, strategy 
lessons, guided reading, guided writing, shared reading, shared writing, close reading, word study, and fluency maybe 
provided to students. An online school intervention progress monitoring system has been created and added to our school 
website to monitor the progress of the students in six-week intervals.   
 
 ENL teachers participate in the monthly grade level unit planning to work closely and collaboratively with classroom teachers 
to discuss curriculum and revise curriculum to meet the diverse academic needs of our ELLs at varying levels of language 
proficiency. 
 
 Rosetta Stone language learning web-based software has been purchased and is being implemented for all ELLs at Entering 
and/or Emerging levels in grades 2-5 to help ELLs with their English vocabulary development. Additional small group/ 
individualized ENL instruction is provided to entering ELLs during our weekly tutorial periods to promote oral language and 
vocabulary development. Our customized ELL Newcomers Kits are also available to teachers of beginner ELLs in grades 2-5 as 
additional resources to facilitate their student's English language development as well as student's transition to the new 
English school system. 
 
 Enhanced ELL Resources from Learning A-Z have been purchased to provide classroom teachers of ELLs with additional 
resources to support the academic and language growth of students. Teacher's College Professional Development Cycle on 
supporting ELLs in reading and writing workshops is provided to all ENL teachers to help better serve the needs of ELLs. 
        
 In order to provide adequate and effective small group/differentiated instruction for our ELLs, five new ENL teachers were 
added to our staff in school year of 2017-2018. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

 
Imagine Learning web-based software is implemented to address the needs of ELLs with disabilities (ELL/SWD) in self-
contained classes in grades K and 1. Raz Kids, Imagine Learning, Lexia, online phonics program, Leveled Literacy Intervention, 
AIS reading, AIS Math and AIS SETTS are also provided to students in need of academic intervention and support.   
 
 Supplemental Title III After school and Saturday programs such as Lexia Blended Learning Platform, Achieve 3000 Literacy 
Program, Differentiated Math Program, LEAP Literacy Program, and Mondo Oral Language Reading Program for Newcomers 
are created and implemented to further target the diverse needs of ELLs at different language proficiency levels. ELLs in grades 
2-5 who scored low to medium in reading and writing in NYSESLAT and/or scored at level 1 in NYS ELA exam and/or NYS Math 
exam are invited to attend these supplemental programs. ELLs who are new to the United States and scored at Entering level 
in NYSITELL are invited to participate in the Mondo Oral Reading Program for Newcomers. 
 
           
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 In order to improve educational outcomes for “at-risk” students in all grade levels, including English Language Learners, so as 
to ensure that they are on track of college and career as described in the Common Core Learning Standards, P.S. 
89  continues  to use reliable and valid data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework. 
The RTI team, which consists of teachers and administrators, 
•               periodically reviews summative and formative data for all at-risk students, including ELLs, and 
determine                   academic  needs based on data and develop programs that target skills deficiencies. The RTI 
team                             assigns staff and purchases materials that target the needs of these at-risk students.•               Schedules 
targeted academic intervention services for at-risk students who are performing well below                       grade level using 
Kindergarten Oral Language Intervention, Early Intervention Reading Lab, Leveled                            Literacy 
Intervention.•               Collects data on all intervention services/programs.  Reviews the data to monitor the progress 
of                                 students within each program. 
In addition, Pupil Progress Committee meets regularly to discuss individual students who despite Tier I interventions are not 
making adequate progress  toward grade level benchmarks.   
 
Tier I interventions are as follows: 
Small group instruction, which may include strategy lessons, guided reading, guided writing, shared/close reading, component 
work, fluency, word study, and GoMath! Tiered interventions. 
Teachers monitor the progress of students receiving Tier I interventions every six weeks. Students who are progressing well 
with Tier I interventions usually have those services reduced or removed. Students not making adequate progress with Tier I 
interventions are advanced to Tier II interventions based on student progress or lack of progress.  Tier II interventions are, 
then, scheduled for a minimum of three (3) times each week.       
 
Tier II interventions are as follows: 
Imagine Learning, RazKids, Starfall, Rosetta Stone, Great Leaps, Think Central, Achieve 3000, Khan Academy, Lexia, Front Row 
Math Program, as well as other programs and interventions. 
The progress of those students receiving Tier II interventions is recorded on the school website in six-week intervals.  Students 
making adequate progress with Tier II interventions usually have their services reduced or removed.  Students not making 
adequate progress are advanced to Tier III interventions based on the outcome of a PPC meeting. 
 
Tier III interventions are as follows: 
AIS reading, AIS math, At-risk speech, At-risk SETSS 
Students receive these services based on the outcome of a PPC meeting.

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  
PS 89Q uses multiple outcome assessments data such as NYSESLAT, NYS ELA assessment  and NYS Math assessment to 
evaluate and inform our ELL programs.   
 
The analysis of our 2017 NYSESLAT on the data analysis tool EDAT reveals that our English language learners (ELL) made 
remarkable progress in the spring 2017 NYSELSAT: 58 (7.1%) ELLs achieved Commanding level and the majority of our ELLs 
(451) obtained Expanding level. 563 test takers scored high in Speaking modality; 146 scored high in Listening; 263 scored high 
in Reading and 188 scored high in Writing. 187 ELLs (35%) advanced 1 or more proficiency levels. However, the data also 
indicate that 324 ELLs remained at same proficiency level and 146 ELLs performed low in Writing modality.  
 ELLs in all grades, in general, need to continue to improve in Speaking, Listening, Reading, and, particularly, in writing 
modality. A small number of ELL newcomers across the grades need to strengthen their English oral language and listening 
skills as well as reading and writing. 
 EDAT analysis not only demonstrates student's overall and individual performance in NYSESLAT,  it also identifies in which 
modality students performed well and in which modality students performed inadequately. Based on a combination of various 
academic performance data and elements such as NYS summative assessments in NYSESLAT, English Language Arts, 
Mathematics, individual student's growth percentile, years in services, etc. EDAT further indicates if a student is at risk and at-
risk levels. Data yielded from EDAT is shared and reviewed with teachers of ELLs at common prep meetings. Teachers of ELLs 
use the data to inform their instructional decisions. As a result, strategic instructional plans targeting skill deficiencies are 
carefully developed. For example, the 2017 NYSESLAT results reveals that 54 ELLs (about 30%) out of 181 test takers in second 
grade performed low in the modality of writing. Based on the findings, small group instruction aiming at enhancing writing 
skills including vocabulary, sentence structures, story and/or essay development, organization of writing, is provided to the 
students according to their individual needs.  Students are also engaged in carefully planned activities where oral language and 
written language build upon each other. 
 
 Along with NYSESLAT data, the outcome assessment data of ELA and Math are also used to inform and evaluate our 
instruction for ELLs.  Student's individual performance on each item of the ELA and Math exams are analyzed on our school 
data portal. This item skills analysis provides  teachers with clear evidence of where individual student's learning strengths and 
needs are. While continuing to enhance student's learning strengths, teachers use the data of the analysis to guide their 
planning for small group/differentiated instruction to address student's areas of needs. 
 
 Based on the multiple outcome assessments data, our ELLs are grouped heterogeneously for targeted area of 
instruction.  Students participate in small group and task-oriented situations that guide the production of language both in 
verbal and written form. Instructional materials are carefully selected to promote both social and academic vocabulary, 
concept learning and comprehension skills as well as reinforcing the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. Art, music and drama are integrated into the lessons to reinforce these four language skills. 
 
Language is also infused through instruction in content areas such as Mathematics lessons and Social Studies lessons where 
ENL teachers incorporate ESL strategies and techniques to promote the development of academic language and domain 
specific concept learning. In addition, technology-based educational programs, the use of computers/Ipads equipped with 
internet access, are available to all students, including ELLs.

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Findings of NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and NYS Math outcome assessments are disseminated to and discussed with teachers at 
September staff conference. Professional development on using school data portal where all assessments data are integrated

is provided to teachers at the beginning of the school year and every teacher is given access to the data portal. 
 
These findings are further examined and deliberated afterwards at the grade meetings with the grade supervisors. Learning 
goals are set and/or adjusted to address the areas that need improvement and strategic action plans are developed to help 
students achieve the goals. Teachers meet once a month as a grade to plan for the upcoming units of study where they read 
curriculum, review student's progress and revise instructional programs based on student's needs. 
 
 In addition, findings on student's assessments data throughout the school year are also disseminated and discussed at 
scheduled teacher's individual meetings with their grade supervisor. 
   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 At P.S. 89Q, the English as a New Language instruction for ELLs in K-5 is aligned with the state Bilingual Common Core 
Progressions and New York State Learning Standards for the English Language Arts (ELA) and content areas. 
 
The ENL program ensures the continuity of rigorous instruction on all academic areas, and is implemented mainly 
through a push-in/integrated  ENL model for the mandated minutes as described in CR Part 154.2. All English 
Language Learners are heterogeneously grouped from the entering, emerging level, to the transitioning level, and the 
expanding level in their respective classes. 
 
 In our integrated ENL model a certified ENL teacher and the classroom teacher co-teach the class for the mandated 
minutes as described in CR Part 154.2. ELLs at Emerging Level are provided with 270 minutes a week of integrated 
ENL/ELA instruction; ELLs at Transitional and Expanding levels are provided with 180 minutes per week of integrated 
ENL/ELA instruction; recent Proficient/Commanding students (Former ELLs) are supported with 90 minutes per week 
of integrated ENL/ELA instruction. Certified ENL teachers and classroom teachers plan and deliver lessons 
collaboratively to support students’ language development and participation in content areas. The ENL/ELA 
integrated instruction is implemented during Reader’s and Writer’s Workshop and Literacy Skills block. ENL 
methodologies and instructional strategies such as Natural Approach, Language Experience Approach, Cooperative 
Learning, modeling, Differentiated/Small Group Instruction and scaffolding are pervaded each lesson.  
 
In our Standalone ENL Program, instruction is delivered by a certified ENL teacher through push-in/pull aside model. 
ELLs at Entering and Emerging levels, as determined by NYSESLAT or NYSITELL testing results, are provided with 180 
minutes and 90 minutes per week respectively of English language instruction, focusing on the development of 
vocabulary, Listening, Speaking, fundamental reading and writing skills. ENL methodologies and strategies such as 
Total Physical Response, Natural Approach, Language Experience Approach,  Modelling and Cooperative Learning as 
well as visual aids, realia, technology are utilized to promote student’s understanding and language acquisition . 
Appropriate native language support is also employed where applicable. In addition, differentiated/individualized 
instruction is provided to Newcomer ELLs at Entering and/or Emerging Level twice a week in the English as a New 
Language Lab to further support their language acquisition. 
 
 In order to maximize student’s opportunity to success, our ELLs are grouped flexibly for targeted areas of instruction 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

 

based on a wide-ranging reliable assessment measures such as unit assessments, teacher conference notes, and 
Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Assessments as well as NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL scores. Teachers model the 
use of language in ways that offer opportunities for students to participate by listening, speaking, reading and/or 
writing. Teaching materials include a wide range of texts, visual and digital-resources, including Smart Boards, 
document cameras, CD players, computers with CDs along with corresponding English books for increasing English 
language proficiency.  Informational texts, trade books of different genres, and leveled library books are part of the 
Reader’s and Writer’s Workshops. Fluency centers, which focus on students’ oral language development, are being 
implemented for students in grades Kindergarten through 5th grade. 
 
Furthermore, the ENL teachers regularly diagnose students instructionally and use the Rigby On Our Way to English 
Program to provide small group/differentiated balanced literacy instruction. To increase comprehensible input, ENL 
Read Aloud Pocket Charts, visuals, realia, manipulatives, pictures, pantomime, Smart Boards, and document cameras 
are utilized in teaching all subject areas to help develop/promote both social and academic vocabulary, concept 
learning and comprehension skills as well as reinforcing the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. Art, music and drama are also integrated into the lessons to reinforce these four language skills. Educational 
software and instructional technology, home language literature and bilingual dictionaries are also available to the 
students to enhance their language proficiency and academic performance. 
Teachers use all the resources available to support student's understanding of the main academic content. Language 
functions and structures are incorporated as key elements of the lesson within the context of each lesson.     
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

        N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

The organizational model in Dual Language Program at P.S. 89 is self-contained, with ENL instruction provided by the 
Bilingual/ENL certified classroom teacher(s). There are two teachers for each grade level.  One teacher in a grade 
partnership is a certified Bilingual/ENL teacher. All ELLs are receiving instruction as mandated by CR Part 154.2. 
 
The Dual Language program  provides both English Language Learners and English proficient students with an 
academically rigorous curriculum in both languages that will enable them to meet or exceed New York State and City 
Standards. Currently, there are three Dual Language classes in Kindergarten, two Dual Language classes in each grade 
from First grade to Fifth grade. The Spanish/English Dual Language program is implemented using a 50/50, side-by-
side model. Beginning in Kindergarten, all Dual Language students are offered fifty percent English Language Arts, and 
fifty percent Spanish Language Arts. Students alternate daily between classrooms, and all content areas are taught in 
the classroom language. For example, a child in the English classroom on Monday will receive all literacy and content 
area instruction in English on that day, and on Tuesday that child would be in the Spanish classroom and would 
receive all literacy and content area instruction in Spanish. English Proficient students (EPs) and ELLs are integrated at 
all times from Kindergarten to Fifth grade. 
               

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

As per CR Part 154.2 regulation requirements, all ELLs at Entering stage of language development receive 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week ( 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 integrated ENL/ELA); Students at Emerging level also receive 
360 minutes of ENL instruction per week ( 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes 
of integrated ENL in ELA or any other content area);  Students at Transitioning level receive 180 minutes of ENL instructional 
time per week (90 minutes of integrated ENL /ELA, 90 minutes of standalone ENL or intergrated ENL in ELA or Content Area); 
Students at Expanding level receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week (90 minutes of ENL/ELA, 90 minutes of Stand-
alone ENL or intergrated ENL in ELA or Content Area). Students who reach Commanding level in the NYSESLAT are former ELLs 
and entitled to 90 minutes of integrated ENL per week for two years after testing out. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

  
The ENL program at PS89Q is implemented mainly through a push-in/co-teaching model. ELLs at Entering and Emerging levels 
are provided with 90 minutes of ENL instruction four times a week by fully certified ENL teachers and/or 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL in ELA and/or content area instruction (e.g. Math ) per day by the classroom teachers. ELLs at Transitioning and 
Expanding levels receive 45 minutes of ENL instruction four times a week from licensed ENL teachers and more than 90 
minutes of instruction in Integrated ENL/ ELA and/or Integrated ENL/content area per day from the classroom teachers. An 
English as a New Language Lab is established to provide additional ENL support to ELLs at Entering level in grades 3-5. All our 
ELLs are programmed to be serviced according to the CR Part 154.2 regulations.  
  
The organizational model in Dual Language Program at PS89 is self-contained, with ENL instruction provided by the ENL 
certified classroom teacher(s). There are two teachers for each grade level. At least one teacher in a grade partnership is 
certified Bilingual/ESL teacher. All ELLs in the program are receiving adequate amount of instruction in ENL and/or integrated 
ENL in ELA or Content area as mandated by CR Part 154.2. 
    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
Content area in our Freestanding ENL program is aligned with the New York State Learning Standards. The instructional 
language is English. Teachers of the subject areas are provided with professional development on second/new language 
acquisition and ENL methodologies and techniques throughout the school year.  ENL methodologies and strategies are 
permeated through the lessons to help make the content comprehensible. Materials in the content areas are carefully chosen 
to foster language development as well as content learning. Content area teachers regularly evaluate students and diagnose 
their instructional needs through observation, conferencing, unit assessments, and other various reliable assessment 
measures. Instructional plans are adapted accordingly to meet the individual needs of the students. .The instructional 
materials used in the content areas for ELLs are as follows: Go Math, Social Studies Program "Trade Book Series", Science 
materials that align with New York State Science Learning Standards.  
  
Content area instruction in the Dual Language Program is aligned with the New York State Learning standards in Math, Science 
and Social Studies. It is provided in both English and the Native Language (Spanish) by the classroom teachers according to the 
school’s Language Allocation Policy. The instruction is also supported by instructional materials in both English and Spanish 
such as Go Math in Spanish, Social Studies "Trade Book Series" in Spanish and standards-based Science program in English. In 
addition, students receive at least 3 periods of content instruction per week from content specialists in English. The content 
specialists utilize the workshop model and employ ENL methodologies during the lessons. Some of the content specialists are 
licensed in Teaching English as a New Language. 
 
Select ELLs who are at risk are receiving AIS in mathematics, as well as AIS in literacy through the Early Intervention Reading 
Labs, the Rosetta Stone computer-based program, and Leveled Literacy Intervention program to further support their 
academic learning, as well as language acquisition. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students in the Dual Language Program are assessed using EL SOL and the Spanish Rigby Literacy assessment program four 
times per school year.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use a variety of instructional strategies and grade level materials through the Teacher’s College Reading 
and Writing units, GO Math and Orton GIllingham programs that both provide access to academic content areas and 
accelerate English language development. Teachers of ELL-SWDs utilize such instructional strategies as, modified instructions, 
providing handouts and visual aids, when appropriate, pairing a reader with a non-reading student during in-class assignments, 
use more than one way to demonstrate or explain information, breaking information into small steps when teaching many 
new tasks in one lesson (state objectives, review previous lesson, summarize periodically). Teachers of ELL-SWDs also allow 
time for clarification of directions and essential information. Technology-based ENL programs such as Imagine Learning, 
Rosetta Stone and other educational programs are implemented in the daily curriculum. In addition, smart boards, 
document  cameras, Front Row, CD players, and computers with internet access are utilized to teach all content areas 
including English as a New Language. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs are placed according to their individualized Education Plans (IEPs) in either a Self-Contained Class, an Integrated Co-
Teaching Services (ICT) class, or into a Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) program. Instruction implemented 
for ELLs -SWDs is rigorously aligned with NYS Learning standards and flexibly scheduled. Teachers regularly monitor student's 
progress and assess their learning through teacher conferences, unit assessments, TC Reading and Writing benchmarks 
assessments,  and in-house Math benchmark assessments.  Based on their progress evaluation and individual needs, students 
are grouped flexibly and small group/one-on-one/differentiated instruction aligning with their individual IEP learning goals is 
provided to these students by both classroom teachers and ENL teachers.  Blended instruction and learning methods are also 
implemented to further address the diverse needs and learning styles of the students. Technology such as Front Row 
amplification system and Smart Boards, computer-based literacy programs with rich visual support such as RAZ-Kids and 
Imagine Learning have been implemented in the classrooms to maximize their opportunity for language and academic success. 
Their interventions are monitored closely by the Assistant Principal of SWDs, the School Based Support Team (SBST), as well as 
the guidance counselors and teachers , along with the classroom teachers and parents, to ensure that each student is receiving 
the appropriate interventions. All Title III after school programs (subject to availability) are available to ELLs with special needs, 
as well.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The following Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are in effect for all ELLs who require additional support and improvement in 
academic performance:  
 In order to better support students in their academic success, PS 89Q conducts its own hearing screening for all the “at risk” 
students, including “at risk” ELLs, in grades K-5. An audiologist was hired to train the staff who conduct the screening. Students 
who are found in need of help receive additional support.   Moreover,  based upon student’s needs and the extent to which 
those needs affect educational performances, the following related services  are also provided to ELLs:  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The curriculum at P.S. 89 is revised as needed each month during collaborative unit planning based on the results of student 
assessment data in order to better support students with the common core learning standards.     
 
A transitional Newcomer's Class for recently arrived ELLs with limited or no knowledge of English language skills will be 
established in school year 2017-2018 to help newcomer ELLs to develop English oral language and basic literacy skills and help 
them adjust to the new school system and social environment.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 P.S.89Q is a diverse, multi-cultural school community. Many teachers speak more than one  language. Home language support 
is available to ELLs, especially newcomer ELLs, in the general education classrooms. Instruction in non-fiction science and social 
studies content reading and academic vocabulary learning is supported with student’s home language, where appropriate, to 
facilitate student’s comprehension. Teachers have access to Bilingual Glossaries in 24 languages. Students are afforded the 
opportunity to speak in their home language during the lunch periods, recess, gym class, and on class field trips.  In the 
classroom,  ELL  Newcomers are supported in a buddy system using triads, or partnerships with students who speak the home 
language. The ELL Newcomers’ Kits, which contain English vocabulary development photo cards translated into13 other 
languages, English/Spanish bilingual Oxford Picture Dictionary for kids, and English/Chinese bilingual Oxford Picture Dictionary, 
are available to the classroom teachers to support their new English language learners. Additionally, the school library contains 
multi-cultural books in different languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Bengali, Urdu, Arabic, etc. All students, including 
ELLs, are provided with the access to borrow books from the school library as well as their classroom  library. 
All Spanish language classrooms in the Dual Language Program contain comprehensive and extensive leveled home language 
libraries that support the students during independent reading, as well as in the content area instruction. Materials in Spanish 
are also available for Guided Reading, and book clubs. Additionally, all Go Math books are used in the language of instruction 
for that day. For example, the math lesson is taught in Spanish, using Spanish books and materials, when a student is in the 
Spanish  room, and the lesson is taught in English, using English materials , on days when the student is in the English

Spanish.      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our mission at P.S. 89Q is to provide every student with a solid foundation for learning through high quality, standards-based 
instruction in all academic areas and to develop all students into life-long learners, ready to be productive members of the 
world community. All the required support services and resources provided to ELLs are developmentally and age appropriate 
based on  professional evaluation using formative and summative assessments, and research conducted in the field. For 
example, Fundations, a phonics program, is used for the students in Kindergarten, grade 1 and grade 2; Sadlier vocabulary and 
grammar program is used for grades 3-5; Block-based Programming is offered to students in grades 4 and 5 while introduction 
to computer and IPads is offered to grades K-2; Level literacy books are used to meet different reading levels of students, 
including ELLs and ELLs/SWD. In addition, Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETTS) in literacy and math skills are 
provided to address the needs of ELLs/SWD at different grade/age levels. Occupational Therapy(OT), Physical Therapy(PT), 
Speech and Language services, Adapted Physical Education (AP), and counseling are provided to ELLs with special needs. 
Furthermore, Integrated Co-teaching classes and small reduced-size classes are also provided to ELLs and ELLs/SWD according 
to their needs by age and grade level. 
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
         
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
  Every year in June, our school holds a parent orientation meeting for incoming Kindergarten students. The Principal and the 
Assistant Principals explain the different programs offered by the school, class schedules, school rules and regulations. 
Translation is provided at the meeting by trained pedagogues in Spanish, Bengali, and Chinese as requested by parents. 
Parents of local preschool programs are invited to attend the  parent workshops at P.S. 89Q and provided with an opportunity 
to take a guided tour of the school.  Orientation meetings are also held for parents of newcomer ELLs at the beginning of the 
school year and throughout by the ENL teachers for parents to be informed and choose the program for their children. 
Translation in different languages is provided at the meetings by the ENL teachers, parent coordinator and other school 
pedagogues who are fluent in targeted workshop languages. In addition, ELLs in grades 2-5 are offered an opportunity to 
attend a Title III ELL Summer School Program for ELLs to ensure that these students receive continuous support during the 
summer months (subject to funding). This program provides ELLs with high quality instruction in English as a New Language 
and Mathematics.

classrooms, and select content areas such as Math, Social Studies and Science are taught in the classroom 
language. For example, a child in the English classroom on Monday will receive all literacy and content 
area instruction in English on that day, and on Tuesday that child would be in the Spanish classroom and 
would receive select literacy and content area instruction in Spanish. English Proficient students (EPs) and 
ELLs are integrated at all times from Kindergarten to Fifth grade. Matching classrooms are maintained in 
each language featuring extensive libraries and print rich environments in each target language. All texts 
and instructional materials for content area instruction are maintained in both languages.  
    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  All teachers, including ENL, Special Education and AIS teachers participate in rigorous ongoing Learning Standards-aligned 
professional development during monthly Unit Planning Team meetings. Teachers also receive cycles of Professional 
Development provided by Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) Staff Developers, and Expertise Days from 
Senior TCRWP Staff Developers. Many teachers are scheduled to attend Calendar Day Workshops at Teachers College in areas 
of interest and need.  Weekly Monday afternoon in-house professional development by school staff and/or invited guests is 
provided throughout the school year based on staff needs as determined by classroom observations. Workshops include topics 
such as curriculum planning in Literacy, Go Math, Social Studies, Science, Arts, technology, student's goals and needs. Teachers 
also participate in professional development on Danielson/Advance using Engage NY, teaching channel.org, and monthly 
Supervisory Teacher Team Meetings. Furthermore, professional development in all curriculum areas is conducted by the 
literacy coaches through the New Teacher Academy to all new teachers on a weekly basis.  
Please refer to our school's 2017-2018 Comprehensive Educational Plan(CEP) for the full professional development plan for all 
the teachers, including the teachers of ELLs, at P.S. 89Q.    
  
  Ongoing Professional Development (PD) for all teachers, coaches, and school administrators will include: 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
Teachers at PS 89 receive extensive ELL-specific professional training, far surpassing the required hours by CR Part 154.2. 
Teachers are regularly provided with school-wide professional development on topics, which includes, but not limited to, 
English as a New Language Acquisition, Integrated ENL and content instruction for ELLs, ENL strategies and methodologies, 
Assessments for ELLs, and small group/differentiate instruction. Records are maintained for professional development 
attendance, location, time and agenda by the school literacy coaches. Activities include the following:

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 In addition to the ongoing Parent Orientation meetings, Teacher-Parent conferences and ENL workshops with parents, the 
ENL teachers at P.S. 89 hold individual meetings with the parents/guardians of their students every Tuesday afternoon during 
Professional Work & Parent Outreach time to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s English language development 
progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. 
In order to best communicate with the parent, an interpreter or translator is provided as needed for the parent at such 
individual parent meetings.    

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Active parent involvement in their child's education helps promote positive thinking and strengthen trust and collaboration 
between school and home.  Our ELL Parents  are encouraged to take an active part in the Parent Involvement Committee 
comprised of parents, parent coordinator and an Assistant Principal. The Title I Parent Involvement Committee meets to 
develop and evaluate Title I services.  Parents are also members of the School Leadership Team and participate in scheduled 
meetings; they provide input on the selection of curriculum, instructional materials for students, and assist in aligning the 
budget to meet the needs of our ELLs. 
 
 A telephone messenger service in different community languages is utilized to notify and remind parents of important school 
events. 
 
 Parent attendance rate in the monthly Parent-Teacher Association meetings, Teacher-Parent Conferences, Open School Week 
and School Night are extremely high. Parent volunteers trained by the Learning Leaders are  involved in assisting students and 
teachers in many classrooms.  
 
Many parents actively participate in the school’s First Steps Parent-Toddler Program, which was created in 2006 in an effort to 
help close the achievement gap. The program, operating once a week, teaches parents how to help their young children 
develop English oral language skills by modeling oral language strategies in small groups, using books and educational 
toys/games. Parents are given access to the First Steps lending library where they can borrow books and materials, thus 
practicing the strategies that they have learned with their children at home.  
 
 Many parents attend various parent workshops in literacy, Mathematics, addressing such topics as: familiarizing parents with 
the school system, the ENL and Dual Language programs, ENL/ELA standards and assessments for ELLs. and strategies to help 
children at home. Workshops on topics such as nutrition, diabetes, breast and cervical cancer, immigration and New York City 
Schools Account, school attendance and safety among others are also provided for parents. 
 
Translation services are provided for the PTA meetings, Parent-Teacher conferences and workshops by school pedagogues 
and/or interpreters from a translation agency.                  
 
In addition, the following activities are designed to engage parents in participating in their child's education: 
             1. Be proactive 
             2. Begin with the End in Mind 
             3. Put First Things First  
             4. Think Win-Win 
             5. Seek  First to Understand then to be Understood  
             6. Synergize 
             7. Sharpening the Saw  
 
Entertaining and family friendly activities are devised to engage students in practicing the previously learned skills, such as

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Laura La Sala, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
