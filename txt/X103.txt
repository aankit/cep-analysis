Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We work constantly to ensure that students become passionate and enthusiastic learners while acquiring the 
knowledge and skills necessary to participate in our global society.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Hector Fontanez School provides a rigorous and nurturing education to about 1000 students of diverse 
backgrounds and educational experiences. We provide our students with a very strong arts program that includes 
Education Through Music and visual arts. We believe that by analyzing informal and formal data we can plan 
instruction that aims to support students’ strengths and needs. 

This year we will work to ensure a rigorous instruction across the grades. As a school we are focusing on supporting 
our students' meta-cognitive skills development. Based on teacher observation reports and PPO visits, many of our 
teachers were working hard at following curriculum maps, but still need more focused attention on differentiating 
instruction based on the current needs of the students. They also still need more focused attention on how to use 
formative assessments to monitor student learning throughout a lesson. It was evident in our classroom visits that 
students were often not being pushed to question what they are thinking about or question the thinking of others. 
Our teachers will benefit from hands-on support in recognizing when to the push that thinking and make it visible for 
students as well. They started the year with setting the expectations and norms for each of the subject areas while 
giving time for students to reflect on the importance of the work they do. 

 

In addition to this work, the Professional Learning Committee (PLC) analyzed the school's current state and desired 
state in all components of the Framework for Great Schools. Through that work, the PLC was divided into four task 
forces that developed professional learning opportunities for teachers and engaging workshops for parents for the 
2018-19 school year. The four task forces were: Questioning and Discussion Techniques-developing meta-cognitive 
skills , Parent Engagement, and Communication Across Grades. Each task force designed their goals in conjunction 
with the CEP goals. Throughout the school year, Monday PD sessions, additional professional learning experiences 
and parent workshops were offered by these teams to continue to build a cohesive understanding of research based 
pedagogy and content knowledge. At the end of the year, through teacher feedback and parent surveys, the task 
forces were able to decide on how to make continued improvements in all aspects of our school community for the 
2018-2019 school year. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have and will continue working to ensure that our ELL and Special Education population receive the support 
needed so they can succeed. Our ELL students are in need of academic support to develop language (Native Language 
and ESL) and mathematical skills that are critical for their success. Our special education students are challenged by 
existing gaps in ELA and Mathematics as well as their emotional and social challenges. ENL students and special 
education students will be supported through the implementation of best pedagogical approaches to ensure that 
their academic gaps in ELA and Math will be addressed effectively. In addition, we will provide the social and 
emotional support for all our students so they can build the skills that will allow them to maximized their learning 
experiences.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

P.S.103 will continue to increase academic rigor, collaboration among teachers, and parental engagement, as well as 
providing students the emotional and social support needed for them to succeed in a very demanding educational 
world.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
After conducting a comprehensive assessment of our school by analyzing the feedback given by the Superintendent's, 
Instructional Focus Team, teacher observations, and the performance by our students, we concluded that: 

 

Strengths: 

  Teachers are implementing and incorporating professional development sessions from in house staff 

members as well as outside consultants based on identified patterns in observations and teacher surveys. 

  Teachers are analyzing formal assessments to inform their practice and to revise curriculum maps based on 

identified students’ strengths and needs after data analysis meetings with Administration and the Data 
Specialist. 

Needs:  

  Teachers need to increase academic rigor by planning questions and building structures for discussion 

techniques through tasks that enhance students’ opportunity to develop Higher Order Thinking Skills-Meta-
cognitive skills. 

  Teachers need to become experts in using reading, math, science, and social studies informal assessments to 

 

plan for differentiation in daily instruction. 
Students’ reading fluency and comprehension needs need to be addressed with actionable and specific 
feedback to teachers from administrators in order to increase students’ performance when reading literature 
and informational texts. 

  NYS ELA Test Results: 

o  Grade 3 - LImited English Proficient - Constructed Response Average Proficiency Level - 0%

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
After analyzing the OORS reports and school survey focusing on our progress in creating a supportive school 
community environment, we realized that the dean’s office in collaboration with the school guidance and the 
implementation of the PBIS program and PATHS had provided students, teachers, and parent guidelines and protocols 
to maximize the instructional time. However, we feel that our school community needs an extra support to build 
healthy and positive relationships among all staff members, parents, and students. Therefore, we need to facilitate an 
emotional and social program that meets the needs of everyone involved. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of our students will be instructed in the PATHS program (Promoting Alternative Thinking 
Strategies), which positively increases their self-control, emotional understanding, positive self-esteem, relationships, 
and interpersonal problem as evidence by a 25% decrease of in-house suspensions.

staff members, as a sign of positive behavior. Mega bucks will be 
used at a higher value for students that on a weekly basis wear 
uniform, come to school, and are on time. The bucks will be used 
to trade in for items at the school store. The grade that collects 
the most bucks for the month will be able to sign up for an 
incentive activity, such as Arts and Crafts, Just Dance, Popcorn 
Movie, etc.

All students including ENL and SWD students will be part of this 
program with the entire school.  

Students 

Parent Letters are generated through the program to give them 
details about the specific lessons the students will be engaging in 
throughout a particular unit. It will also give them ideas on how 
to continue to the positive attitude at home. Letters are also 
available in Spanish. 

Parents 

During Back to School Night, teachers and administrators 
explained the contents of the PATHs program to parents.  

The Parent Engagement Task Force is working with the PTA in 
conducting workshops promoting the contents of the program. 
Parents are also invited to attend the grade specific assemblies 
where the students will showcase the PATHs program learning 
with their class.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
The school's dean and guidance office will provide opportunities (workshops) to parents throughout the school year 
(2017-18) so they get information about the school's expectation and support systems in place to ensure that they 
have the tools to support their children while at home and at school. A parent letter will be developed and sent 
monthly informing parents about content area goals for the month, events, and other pertinent information. 

School coaches will gather the information that will be included in the school's monthly letter and ensure that the 
parents get the information in a timely manner. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
During monthly data talks with teachers, administrators will ask for evidence of student learning outcomes based on 
PATHS lessons. Full day professional development was provided before school started. In November, the teachers will 
receive the second full day PD. On a weekly basis, we have a staff member collecting each classes total bucks for the 
prior week. At the end of the month, the grade with the most bucks will win an afternoon of Choice activities.

PS 103 has always been a collaborative working environment as evidenced by our Quality Review, Peer Review, 
Learning Environment Surveys and PPO reports. Through feedback provided by our school's Professional Learning 
Committee, it was decided that we focus on ELA & Math Vertical Planning teams. 

It was also evident that our ENL and SWD teachers were not given sufficient time to plan together and share ideas and 
resources. Therefore, a designated period weekly has been put into the schedule. They will also have designated 
Monday PD times to meet as a team to discuss curriculum and current needs of students. In addition, since we have 
departmentalized our 3rd, 4th and 5th grades, a common planning time has been scheduled daily for teachers to plan 
and collaborate. Furthermore, we have requested 5 days for early dismissal so our teachers could have an extended 
period of time to get together for PD in ELA and Math and planning instruction purposes.  

Since P.S103 didn't meet AYP in mathematics, the school community will continue the emphasis on improving our 
math instruction via data analysis, and therefore, provide targeted students with extra support including an after 
school program and push in AIS program.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school’s instructional focus is on Academic Rigor-Meta-cognitive skills development. We use units of study in ELA, 
the Teacher’s College units of studies, and the infusion of Close Reading components to provide students with the 
instructional shifts with regard to reading on grade level. Teachers use informal and formal data to plan and facilitate 
challenging instruction that meets the needs of every student in their class. All rigorous lessons are inclusive of 
differentiated opportunities to support student learning. Our school uses the Eureka Math Program and infuses math 
exemplars into the curriculum to push the rigor in mathematics. Based on the data, administrators and staff review 
and make adjustments to the curriculum when needed. Our Data Specialist hosts data meetings and supports staff on 
analyzing and using data to further meet the needs of students.  

When analyzing our school MOTP data at the end of 2018, it showed that only 85.09% of our teachers were effective 
in Domain 3 - Instruction and 84.48 effective in Domain 1 - Planning and Preparation. When looking at each measured 
component of Domain 3, Questioning and Discussion Techniques (3b) had 62.64% effective, Engaging Students in 
Learning (3c) had 77.01% effective, and Using Assessment in Instruction (3d) had 85.63% effective. When looking at 
each measured component of Domain 1, Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy (1a) had 90.23% 
effective for observations and Designing Coherent Instruction (1e) had 78.74% effective for observations. Based on 
teacher observations, reports and staff feedback, many of our teachers are working hard at following curriculum 
maps, but still need additional focused attention on designing engaging and meaningful learning experiences that are 
differentiated based on the current student needs and the standards. 

 

P.S103 started working in May 2016 with CKingEducation. The PD focus in grades K-2 was building, engaging and 
meaningful fluency activities/games in the areas of number sense and place value. Last year, CKingEducation 
continued working with 3-5 in building up their pedagogy around grade-level appropriate math fluency and content 
knowledge. This year, she will continue the work K-5 in helping teachers build up awareness around getting students 
to think meta-cognitively when problem solving. The Math Vertical Team will get more intense coaching in and 
training from CKingEducation in order to serve as model classrooms for their fellow colleagues. Last year, 
CKingEducation conducted an Adapted Lesson Study with a group of 12 K-2 teachers. This year she will expand that 
work to include 12 more teachers, supporting the teachers that piloted the lesson study last year to serve as 
facilitators. 

 

The Professional Learning Committee (PLC) was created to provide staff an opportunity to build their own capacity to 
be teacher leaders. The PLC is comprised of Administrators, the Union Chapter Leader, Coaches, 1 reading specialist, 1 
Cluster teacher, 1 Paraprofessional, 1 ENL teacher, 1 Special Education teacher, and 6 General Education Teachers to 
represent the whole school community.

and Time-bound. 
By the end of June 2019 and based on student performance in ELA and Math as well as MOTP data, administrators will 
plan and facilitate inter-class visitations where identified teachers will have the opportunity to visit other teachers in 
house and out of school to observe best teaching practices that are rigorously plan and will support them in improving 
their practice and pedagogy in accordance with the Danielson Framework. Students' progress as well as evidence 
collected from formal and informal observation will be used to periodically assess our progress towards achieving the 
goal.

and offer them structures that allow for student build up their 
meta-cognitive skills when problem solving. 

 

By May, after teachers and students have been immersed in 
various pedagogical structures for Math instruction, the 
students along with their teachers will showcase their learning 
through a Math Fair for parents. The students will be engaging 
parents in the process they took throughout the year to build 
conceptual knowledge around key mathematical standards for 
their grade level. 

Students will use rubrics, and participate in feedback sessions 
with teachers with actionable and specific next steps. This will 
support students in knowing their goals and effectively 
articulating their next steps in order to produce finished 
products that meet the Common Core Learning Standards 
appropriate for the grade. 

The PLC task forces will meet regularly to create the 
Professional Learning Plan for each month as well as to identify 
a focus for each month. The PLC task forces will take into 
account our instructional focus and the most immediate needs 
of our school to guide them to effectively plan.  

Classroom teachers, clusters and support service providers will 
use the school wide “Pedagogy Checklist”, created by 
administration and staff as an additional tool to plan and 
deliver instruction. To build a common understanding around 
what is good “pedagogy.” The following five categories will be 
addressed: (1) Engaging Students in Learning (2) Using 
Assessment in Instruction (3) Use of Resources (4) Using 
Questioning and Discussion Techniques (5) Creating an 
Environment of Respect and Rapport

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
During the December (2017), March(2018), and June(2018) benchmarks, we will analyze the progress of the 
attendance rates at events, as well as an analysis of which events had larger attendance and why. We will also 
analyze the means we used to reach out to parents in comparison to the attendance rate for each event. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Attendance sheets from events, feedback forms from parents 

 

Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Hector Fontanez School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Hector Fontanez School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

P.S. 103 will provide supplemental instruction for English Language Learners (approximately 80 
students) in an extended school day format.  Intensive support for language acquisition, 
vocabulary and writing development as well as skills for the NYSESLAT exams will be offered 
to students from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesdays and Thursdays in November through 
March for a total of 28 - 2 hour sessions of supplemental support which will be provided by 7 
teachers (3 ENL, 3 Bilingual, and 1 Content area - Title III).  The sessions will begin on 
Wednesday, November 7,  2018 and conclude on Thursday, March 21, 2018.  Students in all 
grades (K - 5) at performance levels "Entering", "Emerging", and "Transitioning" will be eligible 
to attend these sessions.  
The instructional focus for this program will be to reinforce vocabulary and writing development 
as well as to prepare students to successfully demonstrate the skills and competencies assessed 
by the NYSESLAT assessment, with an emphasis on the reading and writing components, as 
well as oral development.  The language of instruction will be English and/or Spanish according 
to the needs of students. Teachers for the sessions will be identified from among our TBE and 
ENL instructional and other staff members. Materials and supplies that will both bridge and 
extend the work students are currently doing in class will be purchased, including test simulation 
materials, and vocabulary and writing materials to supplement curricula students use during the 
regular school day.   
Materials that will be used to support the program: Rigby on Our Way to English, a systematic, 
research-based program that will reinforce: Oral proficiency, foundation in social and academic 
language, oral fluency through reading passages (front loading vocabulary), literary response and 
reading comprehension activities.  All lessons in the program contain language and content 
objectives.  In addition, the program offers students opportunities to create projects that validate 
students' cultural backgrounds and highlight contributions of different ethnic groups. Projects 
also build self-esteem and foster cultural awareness.  Students are motivated to apply vocabulary, 
language and concepts learned.  NYSESLAT test prep books will also be used to prepare 
students for the exam.

ask  teachers for topics of interest.   Then, we will match teachers to topics according to their 
strengths to facilitate monthly ENL meetings. 
 
Our rationale is to build capacity.  ENL teachers will be expected to turn-key information and 
resources to the entire school staff on how to best support ELLs.  
 
In addition, we will be reaching out to Juan Otero, Instructional Specialist at BFSC to visit 
different classrooms and provide feedback and resources to teachers.  We will also seek out 
inter-visitations to other schools to see best practices from other educators. 
  
 
For 2018-19 school year we will continue to have two ENL Coordinators, Ms. Sori Kim and Ms. 
Aurora Dominguez, who will provide teachers with in-house workshops.  We will create a study 
group composed of teachers of ELLs.  The study group will focus on delving deeper into The 
SIOP MOdel.   The study group will meet throughout the school year 1x/month for 45-50 
minutes during ELL teachers’ common prep period.

P.S. 103x views our ELL students’ families as valuable partners in building and strengthening 
the school culture and community.  The rich experience and cultural knowledge as well as the 
knowledge about their children can be an important building block in developing a successful 
learner.  With this in mind, our school community would like to promote ELL parent 
involvement, and thus student achievement.  Through conversations, surveys and other 
communication channels, we learned that many parents are informed of ELL policy and 
regulations, as well as the available resources for parents in helping their children.  We also 
believe that through the parent engagement activities, we can build stronger parent-school 
community.  
 
  
 
Our goal as a school is to make sure all parents of ELLs receive the same information and 
support, thus we will utilize the staff members with interpretation.  If we cannot find a staff 
member at the school who speak the language needed, we will reach out to the NYC DOE 
Translation and Interpretation Unit for the written translation, on-site interpretation and over-the-
phone interpretation services.  Also, our parents of ELLs will be notified of workshops

NYSESLAT Information Sessions: Ms. Kim and Ms. Dominguez our ENL Coordinators will be 
offering 3-45 minute NYSESLAT information sessions for parents in September, January, and in 
March.  These workshop series will begin with learning to read and understand their child’s 
NYSESLAT/NYSITELL scores, and grow into providing with ideas and resources on how to 
best support their children at home.  
 
Resources available for parents and students: Ms. Ramos, our in-house librarian will provide 
parent with information about resources available to them through the New York Public Library 
system.  We will provide one session in the October-November and another in the March-
April.  The duration of the two sessions will be of one hour each.

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 103 assesses literacy skills for ELLs using various assessment tools.  As a reading assessment, the school uses Fountas and 
Pinnell, TCRWP, concepts of print and teacher daily observations.  During Reading workshop, teachers listen to students read, 
confer with them and give them literacy goals based on their observations.  Teachers also utilize the Fundations program to 
assess student's knowledge of reading and writing.  With the data gathered, teachers have a starting point for each student 
and can differentiate instruction (small groups) according to students' individual needs (i.e. letter recognition, letter sounds, 
sight words etc.).  In addition to reading assessments, pre-and post-writing assessments are given to students to determine 
their proficiency level in writing based on the genre of study.  Students' strengths and weaknesses revealed in the assessment 
drive teachers' instruction to differentiate and plan different strategy groups.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support our ELLs, we have the following systems in place: 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
To identify baseline, progress and areas of need, we currently have the following summative assessments. 
Following assessments are administered to students to measure their progress:  
With the New York State Assessments, progress is measured by comparing student's test score from the previous year with 
his/her score from the current year and by looking at the level the student achieved.  With the Math End of Unit and 
Benchmark Assessments, student progress is measured by looking at the scores and how students have shown improvement 
throughout a unit.   Likewise, writing Post Assessments are compared to the Pre Assessments to see students' growth.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

After summative data has been gathered, we have the following structures in place: 
We have also purchased a new writing program called Write Time for Kids to be used in our ENL classes after noticing students 
lack of improvement in Writing.  2017-2018 school year will be our second year using the new writing program.  The program 
comes with students workbooks which has a grammar component and graphic organizer for each lessons.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ELLs are grouped based on the EDAT, data collected from NYSESLAT (and NYSITELL for ELLs on Grade K) along with the 
formative and summative assessment data (see the assessment lists under Part III - #s 1 and 3).  We have Math and Reading 
teachers providing targeted AIS instructions to students identified as at-risk students for academic difficulties.  In addition, 
classroom teachers design targeted intensive academic support to students in a form of Literacy/Math/Academic centers, 
strategy groups, individual conferences, flexible grouping and etc.  Data on EDAT and NYSESLAT are used to create flexible 
instructional groups based on students' language proficiency levels to address students' strengths and needs in English 
language instruction.       
Our school implements the RtI framework by following the 4 action steps mentioned in the RtI guide.  First, we administer the 
Home Language survey to students newly enrolling in a NYC school.  We also check to see if an ELL student is at risk or below 
benchmark on any particular skill and provide them with RtI support if needed.  Teachers also use data to create a high quality 
instructional environment where they work collaboratively with the students. Students progress is monitored over time using 
data collected from various Assessments and classroom observation.  Based on the data, teachers make necessary 
adjustments to their instruction.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT exam helps to identify the English performance level students are on.  This helps to show the units of study 
required for each of our ELLS and ensure that they are getting the appropriate ENL minutes.  The NYSESLAT, ELA and Math 
data which is used in EDAT also help develop effective instructional programs and help toward achievement of proficiency 
level.   It helps group our students for Academic Intervention Services (AIS).  We have math and reading teacher providing AIS 
instruction for at-risk students.  Changes are made to the curriculum If an achievement gap is shown on the result from the 
New York State assessment. Based on the RLAT report, we have 15 students who scored commanding on their 2017 
NYSESLAT exam.  These former ELLs will be receiving the required ENL services for 2 additional years.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The following are different ways our school communicates the findings:

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our Freestanding ENL classes on each grade are heterogeneously formed with mixed proficiency levels in a self-
contained setting taught by ESOL/Common Branch dually certified teachers.  The ENL Units (minutes) stated on CR 
Part 154-2, are met by the classroom teacher and the number of minutes and the instructional types (Standalone or 
Integrated) are determined by students' proficiency level dictated by their NYSESLAT score found in RLAT and in 
EDAT.  In this self-contained ENL class setting, integrated ENL minutes are provided throughout the day in all content 
subject areas with differentiated instructional approaches based on a profile of students' needs generated by 
EDAT.  In order to design the most effective learning plans for a student, the school uses various formative and 
assessment data such as from NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment, unit assessments, teacher 
observations and etc.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our TBE classes are heterogeneously formed with mixed proficiency levels in a self-contained TBE setting taught by 
Bilingual certified teachers.  The ENL Units (minutes) stated on CR Part 154-2 are provided by the classroom teacher 
and the number of minutes and the instructional types (Standalone or Integrated) are determined by students' 
proficiency level dictated by their NYSESLAT score found in RLAT and in EDAT.   In this self-contained TBE class setting, 
integrated ENL minutes are provided throughout the day in all content subject areas with differentiated instructional 
approaches based on a profile of students' needs generated by EDAT.  Students in a TBE program 
receive HLA instruction in the classroom by the classroom teacher.  In order to design the most effective learning 
plans for a student, the school uses various formative and assessment data such as 
from NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment, unit assessments, teacher observations and etc.   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

This is the school's first year offering Dual Language program to our ELLs whose home language is Spanish.  We have a 
DL program on grade K in a side-by-side model.  The languages taught and used are English and Spanish.  As with the 
Freestanding ENL and TBE programs, ELLs in the DL program receive ENL instruction by the ENL/Common Branch 
dually certified teacher during the English instruction days.  The ENL Units (minutes) and the instructional types 
(Standalone or Integrated) are determined by their NYSITELL scores (found in EDAT) as these K students didn't take 
the NYSESLAT yet.  Students' integrated ENL minutes in content areas are provided on the English instruction 
days.  Students receive all content subject areas with differentiated instructional approaches based on a profile of 
students' needs generated by EDAT.  The teacher in a DL program delivers HLA instruction on a Spanish instruction 
day to ensure mandated HLA minutes are provided.  In order to design out the most effective learning plans for a 
student, the school uses various formative and assessment data such as from NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell reading 
assessment, unit assessments, teacher observations and etc.   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The mandated number of instructional ENL and ELA minutes are programmed by using the EDAT data.  EDAT data shows ELL 
students' various English proficiency levels.  Students' Standalone and Integrated Units/Minutes are programmed in STARS to 
ensure each student's accurate instructional ENL minutes the school provides, mandated by CR Part 154-2.  In addition, HLA is 
delivered in TBE and DL programs by certified bilingual teachers.  The teacher in a DL program delivers HLA instruction on a 
Spanish instruction day to ensure mandated HLA minutes are provided.  Students in a TBE program receive HLA instruction in 
the classroom by the classroom teacher throughout the day.  TBE and DL classrooms have instructional materials in students' 
home language (i.e. Spanish) support the HL learning.                
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The Core Content instructional curriculum used in the school is aligned to the NYS Learning Standards; various grade and 
vertically formed teacher teams, including the ELL Teacher Team will work on tailoring the curricula to meet the demands of 
NYS Learning Standards throughout the year for our ELL students.  As a school, the staff will learn more about the NYS Learning 
Standards and brainstorm the best practices.  During the monthly ELL Teacher Team meetings, teachers will collaborate on 
finding effective strategies that will best support our ELL students in meeting the NYS Learning Standards.   
In the beginning of the year, teachers will receive their ELL students' proficiency levels based on NYSESLAT (or NYSITELL if they 
are new to the NYS school system).  Based on the students' proficiency levels, teachers will determine Stand-Alone and 
Integrated instruction minutes.  Students will receive Integrated instruction in ELA, Math, Science and/or Social Studies by a 
certified dually certified ENL teacher, or a certified Bilingual teacher depending on the students' program setting.         
The classroom teacher will use the data from EDAT and other assessments such as pre-and post assessments in 
writing, Fountas and Pinell Reading assessment, and unit assessments to plan and design appropriate learning activities for the 
students.  Modeling, think alouds, small group instruction, collaborative group work, giving students think time are some 
methods used to make content comprehensible for our students.  AIS support is also given to students by a certified reading 
teacher.  Students are also invited to our ELL After school program.              
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs whose home language is Spanish are assessed in their home language using various assessments.  Spanish LAB is 
administered to newly identified Spanish speaking ELLs.  ELL students in our TBE program, in grades 3-5 are administered 
ELE once a year.  State exams are translated into Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian or Spanish for the speakers of those 
languages.  Otherwise, translator is available to translate the test orally for the students at the administration of the exam in 
their home language, to better assess their content and language knowledge.  Throughout the year, students' home language 
proficiency level is evaluated using formative assessments including Spanish Fountas and Pinnell, teacher-student observations 
and etc.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE: We have one SIFE student in a grade 5 self-contained ENL classroom.  For that student, we provide him with a small 
group instruction targeting basic English skills through music, hands-on activities and strategy lessons by an ENL Coordinator; 
in addition to the differentiated small group instructions provided by the classroom teacher.  The language and English literacy 
are learned through a personalized reading program myON and StarFall.  The student is also partnered and grouped both 
homogeneously and heterogeneously depending on the activity.   
 
b. Newcomer ELLs: They are placed in either an ENL, TBE or Dual Language program (offered currently in K and Grade 1 will be 
offered in the SY 2017-18) and follow the specific model described in Part IV question 3.  In addition to the Stand-Alone and 
Integrated mandated minutes they receive in the classroom by the Dually certified ENL/TBE teacher, these ELLs also receive 
extra support by the school ENL Coordinators in a small group.  The ENL Coordinators provide students with the basic language 
support focused mainly on listening and speaking.  In addition, the students participate in differentiated activities including the 
individualized educational programs/apps based on their needs/strengths and interests.  The students are partnered with a 
more advanced students as a buddy to have a smooth transition into the US school system as well as the content being 
taught.   
 
c. Developing ELLs: They are placed in either an ENL, TBE or Dual Language program (offered currently in K and Grade 1 will be 
offered in the SY 2017-18) and follow the specific model described in Part IV question 3.   
Classroom teachers differentiate activities based on the student’s proficiency level.  Students are also given many

opportunities to work collaboratively with their peers to comprehend the curriculum that is being taught.  Teachers also 
differentiate instruction in small groups according to the individual needs.  In addition to the differentiated instructions 
provided by the classroom teacher, students are also invited to ELL After school program.  Many of our ELLs also 
receive AIS instruction with a reading certified teacher.   
d. Long Term ELLs: They are placed in either an ENL or TBE and follow the specific model described in Part IV question 3.  Long 
Terms ELLs, just like other ELLs are identified on EDAT.  Classroom teachers differentiate activities based on the student’s 
proficiency level.  Students are also given many opportunities to work collaboratively with their peers to comprehend the 
curriculum that is being taught.  Teachers also differentiate instruction in small groups according to the individual needs.  In 
addition to the differentiated instructions provided by the classroom teacher, students are also invited to ELL After school 
program.  Many of our ELLs also receive AIS instruction with a math and reading certified teacher in math and reading.   
 
e: Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status: Former ELLs are provided 90 minutes of integrated ENL services for two 
years by an ENL certified teacher, as per CR Part 154-2.  Former ELLs are also eligible for ELL Testing Accommodations.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We support our ELL-SWDs according to their IEP.  We also recognize that they are ELLs with special needs, thus we modify our 
instruction to best meet their language and IEP goals.   
Following are the instructional strategies and grade-level materials the school has in place for our ELL-SWDs:  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs are serviced by both a certified special education teacher and a certified ENL teacher to meet the ENL minutes 
dictated by the CR Part 154-2, and special education services and accommodations prescribed in their IEPs.  Students' 
classroom placements are organized by their IEPs.  Instructions are delivered and reinforced in flexible groups such as one-to-
one, a partnership, and/or a small group, depending on the instructional and language goals of a lesson.  Depending on each 
ELL-SWD's IEP, students receive instructions in various models from integrated with ENL and Classroom teachers collaborating 
in a classroom, to ENL and/or SETSS teacher servicing a small group of students with same IEP goals and/or language 
proficiency.  School ENL Coordinators Ms. Kim and Ms. Oommen work collaboratively with both special education teachers 
(including SETTS teachers) and classroom teachers to plan individualized instructions considering each ELL-SWD's IEP, CR Part 
154-2, school curricula and Common Core State Standards.  The service providers and teachers examine and analyze ELL-SWDs' 
IEP goals and English proficiency (including EDAT data) to design and modify instructional strategies that would best support 
our ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our developing and long term ELLs were invited to the ELL after-school program on Wednesdays and Thursdays which began 
on February 1, 2017 and ended on April 6th, 2017. English was the language of instruction used for the after school 
program.  However, teachers use native language support through the use of translation programs on Ipads, peers who 
may speak the same language etc.   The ELL after-school program was taught by bilingual and ENL/Common branch certified 
teachers. Many of our ELLs also receive AIS from certified reading teachers.  Math Clusters also use exemplars and 
RTI activities to help students with math strategies. In addition, our ELLs with IEP also receive SETTS support from special 
education teachers.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

ENL teachers will continue to use the writing program adapted from Write Time for Kids as we will need to use the program for 
three years to notice in any growth in the student writing abilities.  ENL Coordinators will push in to classrooms to provide 
added support to students in ENL classrooms, as well as support teachers by coaching in to lessons where language strategies 
can be used.  For math instruction, ENL teachers will be provided with support from a consultant on how to meet the students' 
mathematical language needs during math instruction.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are invited to the following After School programs and extracurricular activities.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In order to more effectively instruct our ELL students the school is currently using various instructional materials.   
We are using a new writing program, Write Time for Kids for our ELL students from grades K to 5.  The program is aligned to 
CCSS and focuses on Narrative, Informational/Explanatory and Opinion/Argument.  The program also includes graphic 
organizers and grade level article/story cards that go with each lesson.  A grammar component is embedded within each 
lesson allowing students to learn and practice English language naturally and purposefully. The writing program is created to 
build four language modalities: reading, writing, speaking and listening, through reading the article/story cards, 
partner/small/whole group discussion, writing, and etc.   
Additionally we have literacy based computer programs/apps used by students: Achieve 3000, Imagine Learning and 
myON.  These individualized literacy based programs address phonemic awareness, achieve reading reading fluency and 
comprehension.  Students on these programs are not only reading, but are listening to the book being read and also are 
encouraged to discuss the book with their peers who've read the same book or a book of same topic.  Depending on their 
language and academic ability, students are encouraged to write about the text as well. With these programs, students are 
encouraged to develop four language modalities.   
In addition, each classroom is equipped with an Interactive board, a document camera and student laptops/iPads, which 
allow teachers to build four language modalities by incorporating visuals, music/videos, and interactive 
activities.  Incorporating technological tools available in the classroom provides students with the opportunity to listen, discuss 
(speak) and share, read and write about the topic they are immersed in, in turn encouraging a learning that encompasses the 
overall development of four language modalities.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Dual Language: 
TBE: 
ENL: 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ELL students are placed in a class based on their age and previous schooling.  Once ELL students are assigned to a class, the 
school ensures that all required services and resources are there to support them as effectively and appropriately 
possible.  Students' information and ongoing data on EDAT and other school reports/data sheets present ELL students' needs 
and abilities.  With the information, teachers of ELLs which could include special services personnel, SETTS teachers, cluster 
teachers and counselors use various resources to best support and meet students' at their appropriate age and grade 
level.  Some of those resources may include TPR, visuals, technology, and music.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. Side-by-Side.  Native English speakers and Native Spanish speakers are integrated for instruction 100% 
of the day.  
b. English and Spanish 
c. Students learn all contents in both English and Spanish languages from two teachers: one English 
speaking (Common Branch/ENL Certified) and one Spanish speaking (TBE Certified).  English and Spanish 
languages are used 50/50 in the program with students alternating between two rooms every other day; 
learning the content in one language a day.  
d. Both English and Spanish languages are taught simultaneously.   
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As a school we believe that all teachers are teachers of ELLs.  Throughout the school year teachers are given the opportunity to 
participate in various workshops offered by BFSC, DELLS and other educational organizations.  Our ENL coordinators, Ms. Kim 
and Ms. Oommen also attend the ELL Liaison meetings offered every month and turn key information to teachers of 
ELLs during the monthly meeting held for ENL and Bilingual teachers.  We also had Dr. Rosa Delgado, a consultant from 
Education Consortium, who worked with a group of teachers consisting of ENL, Bilingual, Special Ed. and Gen. Ed teachers and 
provided them with best instructional protocols and strategies for English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
striving learners.  Teachers were also provided with inter-classroom visitation opportunities to acquire skills in providing 
constructive and actionable feedback to colleagues.  In addition, we have Ms. Christine King, a math consultant, work with our 
teachers to help develop a deeper understanding of challenges with solving word problems and how to better support 
students in becoming more proficient in the application of Mathematical Practices.  Moreover, our school has an ELA and Math 
Professional Learning Committee (PLC) consisting of administrators and teachers from different grades (including, General 
Education, Special Education, ENL, and Bilingual teachers) to help teachers address the needs of all students.  We also have 
an ELA and Math vertical team with teachers from each grade who work together to align the standards across grade 
levels.  School non-pedagogical staff members will be encouraged to attend workshops offered by BFSC as well as the school 
PDs.   
The logs, agendas and/or sign-in sheets from the PDs will be kept by the school Professional Learning Committee, and/or the 
school ENL Coordinator.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The school's Professional Learning Committee (PLC), which is consisted of administrators and teachers of different learners 
including ENL, Bilingual, SWD, General Education, and etc., discuss and create Professional Developments for teachers that 
address the needs of all students, including the ELLs.  To meet the professional development requirements as per CR 154.2, we 
invited Lillian Raimundi an ELL Coordinator for District 11 to share Blueprint for ELL Success, CR Part 154-2, importance of ELL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

education, ELL data and etc.  The school also hired an independent ELL Education Consultant Rosa Delgado to work with 
teachers of both ELL and Non-ELLs in learning the best ELL instructional practices.  In addition to the in-house professional 
development, all teachers are encouraged to attend PDs offered by DELLS, BFSC and other organizations to be better equipped 
to service the ELLs in our school and to refine their practicum.  Furthermore, the teachers of ELLs are encouraged to share with 
their colleagues during the grade team meeting as well as the inquiry team meetings.   
In addition to the professional support and hours provided for all teachers, teachers of ELLs have a common prep period where 
they meet to share effective practices.  This time, teachers of ELLs also turn key valuable information obtained from 
professional developments they attended.  Lillian Raimundi and Rosa Delgado (mentioned above) have also worked with the 
ELL teachers more closely.  Additionally, Michael Lee an ENL Coordinator from DELLS worked with ELL teachers to offer 
differentiated and individualized feedbacks to each teacher of ELLs.   
The records of their attendance and participation are saved by the administration, Instructional Coaches and./or school ELL 
Coordinators.  The school staffs have been shared the BFSC Summer PD schedule and are encouraged to attend workshops in 
refining their practices.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Throughout the school year teachers of ELLs keep an ongoing communication with parents of ELLs to update them 
on students' language and content progress and their goals.  Some of the communication channels teachers of ELLs use are 
telephone call, email, text messages, and messages via class web/app, written notes, in person conversations at 
arrival/dismissal time, and etc.  In addition to the preceding communication methods, teachers of ELLs invite parents of 
ELLs for a meeting to discuss more in depth of the program goals, language/content progress, various assessment results and 
share questions and concerns parents of ELLs may have.  In an effort provide annual individual meetings with every parent of 
an ELL, teachers of ELLs offer available time slots throughout a day/week from before school, during lunch hours, to after 
school hours, including Tuesday extended time that is designated as a Parent Communication hour.   
If and when translation is needed, we reach out to a staff member fluent in the particular language, and/or reach out to the 
NYC Interpretation services for assistance.   
The logs, agendas and/or sign-in sheets from the annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs will be kept by each 
classroom teacher and/or the school ENL Coordinator.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Following are the activities we have for our parents and families including the parents of ELLs.  The programs and events are 
designed to foster their parental involvement for the success of our students.  In order to include and involve all parents of 
ELLs, the school will strive to prepare documents in our parents' preferred language as per HLIS and/or RCPL ATS report.  The 
documents will be translated by our school staff, using existing templates on Translation and Interpretation Intranet page, and 
by using the Translation and Implementation Unit.  In person interpretation at an activity will be available via staff members, 
in-person interpretation and also over-the-phone interpretation services.  For the success of these programs, we worked 
collaboratively with local community members, and educational consultants.   
The agendas and/or sign-in sheets from the ELL parent activities will be kept by the activity organizer/presenter and/or the 
school ENL Coordinator.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Farid Reyes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

A trained pedagogue (usually the school ENL Coordinators) interviews a child and his/her parent(s) to determine 
the home language at the time of registration. The parents' language preference for both written and oral 
communication is inputted in the Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey. We also use the ATS reports 
such as RCPL and RAPL to learn about parents' oral and written preferred language(s). In addition, we also use the 
Student Emergency Contact cards to assess parents' oral and written preferred language(s). School Surveys are 
also sent to parents to assess the parents' preferred oral and written language(s). In addition, classroom teachers 
conduct a survey to gather their parents' preferred oral and written languages.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school uses ROBO call (an automated telephone service that delivers a recorded message) to inform families of 
events and emergencies. In the event of a school emergency, to reach limited-English-Proficient families, we use in-
house staff to assist with translation. If we don't have a staff that speaks the parents preferred language, we will use 
BFSCs over-the-phone interpreter services and access the Language Line to share information with parents in their 
preferred language.
