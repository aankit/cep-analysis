Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 20, The Clinton Hill School Mission Statement: At P.S. 20 we firmly believe in developing the leader in each and 
every child. We are deeply committed to our students' social, emotional and academic growth. We provide an 
intimate and supportive learning environment that challenges students to raise questions, communicate effectively 
and take responsibility for their ideas and actions. We want our students to know that they have the power to 
influence their school, their communities and the world with their creativity, intellect and their ability to work

collaboratively. Our goal is for our children to become informed thinkers who are prepared to thrive and lead in a 
complex world.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Clinton Hill School is located in the heart of Clinton Hill Brooklyn currently serving 455 children pre k - grade 5. 
Enrollment has been climbing over the past four years. This can be attributed to strong academics, a variety of 
enrichment programs grounded in the arts, second language offerings and strong community ties. Parents are an 
integral part of the decision making process, they enjoy access to classrooms where students celebrate learning.  

PS 20 is a Leader in Me school - The Leader in Me Is a school wide process, that aligns with the Academic & Personal 
Behaviors for college and career readiness, in addition to guiding our vision and supporting the establishment of a 
common language throughout the school. All students are exposed to the * Seven Habits of Highly Effective Kids. The 
teacher is the main communication point, an advocate of the tenets of the leader in me process. Students self aware, 
regulating their own behavior promoting pro social behavior throughout the school. The LIM process supports our 
efforts in creating a supportive environment for our students and engages our parents families in the process too.  

Student Led Conferences - Are led by students. It is a conversation that the students lead with a parent or guardian 
and the teacher, at the table together. They look through a portfolio of work that the students have created and 
students lead the discussion around their strengths and their weaknesses. During the conference, students explain 
their progress toward and mastery of both academic (content & skill), character (using the 7 Habits of Highly Effective 
Kids) and learning targets. Students justify their progress by leading their families through a portfolio of assignments 
gathered from a body of class work/ homework/projects/ notebooks etc.

etc. 

Students justify their grades by referencing specific assignments that show their mastery of learning targets. Students 
can also complete self-evaluations of their performance in each subject and share them with their families. Students 
are held accountable for their progress when they explain areas of strength and areas in need of improvement. The 
tone of the conference is positive with a focus on what can be done to ensure success.  

PS 20 Parent Engagement Traditions : Parent Orientation/Meet and Greet in August- Curriculum Night in September - 
This is an opportunity for parents/families to meet the entire faculty and school based support personnel and then 
meet grade teachers in classrooms and learn about the curriculum expectations, as well as celebrations and trips. 
Spring Grade Articulation Day- Parents are invited in to meet next year's teacher teams and learn all about the 
curriculum and learning experiences their child will be exposed to in the next school year. Families as Learning 
Partners - Parents are invited in monthly to engage in a Standards based reading and writing with their child's class, a 
different content area is highlighted monthly. Student of the Month /Parent of the Month- This monthly assembly is 
designed to honor students who have demonstrated scholastic success as it relates to applying one or more of the 
Seven Habits . Students are granted an award and their parent too is for supporting their child through the process.  

Parent workshops- Workshops are planned and conducted throughout the year to inform families on topics such as 
Middle school articulation, physical movement for their child, and language development. Future workshops, will

highlight content area based workshops such as preparing your child to take the NYS ELA and Math test, Response to 
intervention and strategies for ELL learners in the spring . Chat and Chew sessions will commence in November bi -
weekly for our Pre- K- 5 and all new families. Chat and Chew is an informal gathering in the morning. Parents meet 
one another as well as other staff members in the school i.e. social worker, psychologist , guidance counselor, *nurse. 
Expectations are discussed as it relates to attendance and punctuality, literacy and reading at home and ways to 
strengthen the home and school connection. The PS 20 Spring Steam Museum: A full day of sharing and learning. 
During this school wide event, each classroom visits the other classes’ museum exhibits, allowing the students to 
teach and learn from each other based on a carefully planned schedule for inter-class visitation. Families tour each 
classroom, listening to the children explain their STEAM investigations and projects. The classrooms and hallways are 
filled with student work, STEAM artifacts and student discussions. Parents and children move from classroom to 
classroom listening to student docents explain their investigations and leanings.  

French-English Dual Language program- the program currently exists on Kindergarten through grade 5. The initial 
idea of instituting a Dual Language (DL) Program was based on parent interest. In response, since such an instructional 
program was unfamiliar to our school, best practices and program models were researched, demographic data 
collected and interest surveys were conducted. After collecting our school's neighborhood demographics, meeting 
with members of the community and assessing our space and facilities, all stakeholders in our learning community 
came together to discuss and decide to open a French-English DL program. In the process we discovered clear 
advantages in implementing a Dual Language Program (DLP). An evidence and research-based curriculum is being 
developed to appropriately and effectively support our growing Francophone, ELL population's language fluency and 
literacy. Language Instruction in French- In addition to our self contained French Classes we offer French Language 
instruction to all or our students. follows: 

 PS 20 Instrumental Music Program / PS 20 Band- Our students have been studying and performing under the 
musical direction and instruction of Mr. Lonnie Hampton. He follows the Blueprints for Arts curriculum as well as the 
Music standards from which he incorporates several content areas. Students in grades(Pre-K-5) are taught to read 
music as well as learn to play a musical instrument. We are proud to say that our senior band members have played at 
various venues such as Borough Hall, Ft. Greene Park, PTA meetings, school tours, District Family Day, and monthly 
assemblies. 

PD 20 Dance Program - Our Dance program is led by Mr. Chung. His curriculum is aligned to the Arts Blueprint. 
Students actively participate in formal dance classes and performances. Through class participation, students engaged 
in the historic and cultural value of dance, music and theater.  

We partner with our parents and with several community based organizations to enrich our instructional program. 
They are as follows: Art partnerships include instruction in: Music, Dance, Drama/ Theater , French and visual Arts: 
Brooklyn Music School; Mark Morris; Franklyn Furnace; Galli Theater and Language and Laughter Studio. Children's 
Museum of the Arts, City Growers, 

Brooklyn College School of Education -Classroom teachers receive mentoring in best practices in teaching science 
from college faculty, and conversely, our teachers mentor their undergraduate science education college student 
interns. All work collaboratively to improve the student-teacher mentoring experience. This partnership further 
supports science-related initiatives at P.S. 20 such as the P.S. 20 Farms and the P.S. 20 Annual Science Museum. Both 
were developed and are supported collectively by P.S. 20 teachers, administrators, parents and Brooklyn College 
Science Education faculty.  

Green Arts - established in 2013, the Art Committee comprised of parents and the art and garden instructor applied 
and received a grant from the Wallenta's Family Foundation in order to deepen exploratory learning in visual arts and 
science. The overall goal of the Green Art s program is for children, to develop curiosity and a better understanding of 
the environment. They will learn where food comes from, ecology and science, and express their understanding 
through non-conventional use of materials, exploration in color, perspective, light, shape and texture, e.g. using 
principles of visual art to convey big and abstract ideas. Our Artist and Urban Gardener work extraordinarily hard and 
long hours to ensure that their lessons correlate directly to the the State Standards, our school mission, and individual

classroom teacher goals. The fact that these educators are practicing artists in our community means that they know 
about the community in which our students reside, their joys and challenges, their needs and dreams. This is an 
exciting opportunity to present our children with this unparalleled, inspirational, and pedagogically-solid curriculum.  

Trout unlimited : Students raise trout from eggs and release them back into the watershed. "The Trout in the 
Classroom program provides a tangible and practical way to educate elementary students about the importance of 
preserving the rivers, streams, reservoirs, and lakes that supply the world class drinking water that more than 9 
million New Yorkers enjoy every day,” Students also , monitor tank water quality,engage in stream habitat study, 
learn to appreciate water resources begin to foster a conservation ethic, grow to understand ecosystems. 

Cookshop Classrom K-2 /Cookshop Families ( The food Bank of NY ) since 2013. Is a nutrition education program 
providing students and their families the knowledge and tools to enjoy a healthy diet and active lifestyle on a limited 
budget. CookShop Classroom: Using hands-on exploration and cooking activities to foster children’s enjoyment and 
consumption of healthy foods, as well as their appreciation for good nutrition. CookShop for Families offers 
workshops for parents and guardians of students in schools participating in CookShop Classroom. Through simple, 
healthy recipes using fresh, affordable ingredients, the workshops offer the skills and knowledge needed to make 
CookShop part of their families’ daily lives. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

To ensure rigorous habits and higher order skills, among our SWD and ELLs teachers are refining their instructional 
plans to create tasks and activities that are more tightly aligned to the Rigor and Relevance rubric and the established 
instructional priorities of the school ( CEP ), and the individual needs of these students. To ensure that all students, 
ELL and SWD have access to the content we will focus on multiple entry points into rich discussion, using resources 
such as: the Cognitive Rigor Matrix, DOK, Socratic seminar and UDL to plan pivotal questions for discussion. 
Monitoring teacher practice and growth as it aligns to Domain 1, Planning and Preparation via frequent informal 
observation cycles both evaluative and non evaluative that provide evidence based feedback and next steps. these 
practices align to the Effective Leadership element of the Capacity Framework. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Professional Learning - School administrators and all teachers begin this academic year by examining individual 
classroom practice. Then during common planning and time set aside for community professional learning, 
administration and teachers will meet in vertical teams. Teams included an administrator, K - 5 classroom teachers, a 
cluster teacher and school-based support staff member in order to assess and evaluate how the organizational and 
instructional practices across classrooms matched our shared beliefs about how students learn best. Similar work will 
be done during weekly, grade-level specific teacher team meetings to capture the same across each grade. Based 
upon the feedback from teachers and our most recent school-wide data from the New York City Performance 
Assessment we will focus the work above around the Rigorous Instruction element of the Capacity Framework which 
are aligned to Quality Review (QR) Indicators 1.2 (Pedagogy), 2.2 (Assessment) and the Capacity Framework Element 
Supportive Environment aligned to (QR) Indicator 3.4 (High Expectations).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Framework For Great Schools Element- Rigorous Instruction Strengths are as follows:  

According the 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, PS 20 received a rating of Excellent in Rigorous Instruction. 94% 
Parents and Teachers responded positively to questions about Rigorous Instruction. 100% of Teachers of all subjects 
say that they had the resources to include opportunities for reading and writing experiences grounded in evidence 
from text, both literary and informational. 100% of teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to develop 
students' conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and their ability to apply math in context 

According to the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report, PS 20 is WELL DEVELOPED in indicator 3.4- High Expectations. 
The school's culture supports High Expectations focused on independence, leadership and career and college 
readiness that are effectively communicated to students and parents.  

According the 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, PS 20 received a rating of Excellent in Student Achievement. 54% 
of the students in grades 3,4 &5 met State standards on the State English test; the average score was 3.0 out of 4.5. 
63% met State standards on the State math test; the average score was 3.2 out of 4.5. 

According to the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report, PS 20 is WELL DEVELOPED in indicator 1.2 - Pedagogy. There is a 
coherent belief that students learn best when teachers facilitate group work using the workshop model, this is 
reflected in the vast majority of classrooms. Teachers provide high quality extensions and strategic entry points so 
that all students can access curricula.  

According the 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, Next Level Readiness: 100% pass rate by former fifth graders in 
their sixth-grade classes in math, English, social studies, and science. 

Area of need: Teacher Development /Teacher evaluation. According to the 2017-2018 Quality Review Report, PS 20 
is DEVELOPING in Quality Indicator 4.1- Teacher Development and Supervision. Teachers support teachers through 
infrequent cycles of observations. Feedback to teachers captures strengths, and next steps, but inconsistently 
connects to the Danielson Framework for Teaching, especially HE ratings, creating a lack of clarity relative to next 
steps. Observation cycles will focus on literacy instruction Specifically supporting readers in comprehension.  

Based on the most recent data analysis ( January 2019 Fountas and Pinnell Running Records), it has been determined 
that our students are not achieving or progressing in reading comprehension skills at a pace needed to ensure 
proficiency on the State ELA Test. Therefore, instruction will focus on improving and advancing reading 
comprehension skills across the grades. The Advancement of Reading Comprehension skills will be the priority. 
Reading comprehension is a skill that needs to be developed. Comprehension is a complex higher-level skill that is 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

much greater than decoding. It is important for students to develop comprehension strategies. Comprehension 
strategies focus on teaching students to understand what they read not on building skills on how to read/decode. 
While readers acquire some comprehension strategies informally, explicit or formal instruction in the application of 
comprehension strategies has been shown to be highly effective in enhancing understanding (from the Report of the 
National Reading Panel). you can take specific actions to help students develop comprehension skills. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in the number of students in Grades 3-5 who will score a Level 3 or Level 4 
on the 2019 New York State ELA Test. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: PS 20 has strong practices and structures in place as it relates to building community and ensuring that 
children feel safe and protected. According to the NYC School Survey report for 2018 our school has made significant 
gains in the area of Supportive Environment we increased from a score of 2.93 in 2016 to 4.63 in 2017. According the 
2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot, 100% of pre-k through 5 teachers say that students are safe in the hallways, 
bathrooms, locker rooms, and cafeteria of their school. 100% of teachers say that adults at their school teach 
students how to advocate for themselves. 93% of pre-k through 5 teachers say that students feel it is important to 
come to school every day. 

Needs: Upon examining our OSYD data that includes disciplinary referrals and suspensions; teacher and guidance 
counselor anecdotal reports; I log and attendance reports; we discovered a correlation between childhood stress poor 
academic achievement and disciplinary referrals. The students struggling the most academically are our students 
whom we know are experiencing stress in some form. Many of our students are growing up in stressful environments. 
Some of these children are living under the influence of poverty, addiction and /or homelessness. Others may have 
suffered the loss of a parent or loved one. While still others may have suffered complex trauma in some form. These 
factors that so strongly impact the success of many of our students are situated outside of our school. The question 
still remains however- how do we support them toward scholastic success? Current work in educational psychology 
tells us that students’ experience of belongingness in the school setting is linked to important motivational, 
attitudinal, and behavioral factors that are associated with school success. Specifically, we find that this sense of 
belonging to a supportive school community is associated with emotional well-being, intrinsic motivation, pro social 
behavior, commitment to school, engagement, and achievement (Osterman 2002). Our school community must take 
appropriate and deliberate measures in supporting our most vulnerable students by embedding social and emotional 
supports in all aspects of school life. There are three primary categories of social support: emotional support, 
guidance support, and tangible support. Emotional support includes behaviors that express physical affection and 
concern for well-being. Guidance support is the provision of knowledge, advice, or mentoring on how to achieve a 
goal. Tangible support is the provision of any type of resource including money, food, housing, transportation, etc.by 
building a school wide sense of community our staff can help students develop the sense of engagement and 
connectedness important to their ability to focus on learning. (Lee et al. 1999). 

Policies, Practices, and Structures currently place to ensure support of the whole child: Supporting evidence taken 
from the 2017-2018 Quality Review report: Strong school to parent partnerships are forged through: Ongoing 
communication using grade-wide newsletters collaboratively developed by parents, students and staff, instruction 
and curricula are highlighted, class dojo and konstella are used for instant parent outreach and feedback; Ongoing 
curricular workshops across the content areas to ensure that parents understand the expectations in dual language 
classes, science, math, English Language Arts, (ELA), and social studies; leadership curricula across the grades. 
Students keep leadership binders, where they regularly reflect on their growth, areas for improvement and set goals 
for themselves. They reflect on progress, and confer with their teachers to get focused feedback and guidance about

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According the The School Quality SnapShot 2017-2018 the overall rating for Collaborative Teachers is GOOD. 100% 
of teachers say that they design instructional programs (for example, lessons and units) together. 97% of teachers say 
that they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on professional development. 100% 
of teachers say that teachers feel responsible that all students learn. Note: 100% of PS 20 teachers responded to the 
survey (31 surveys submitted) 

According to feed back from PPO visits: Our curricula continues to be aligned to the common core learning standards 
(CCLS) and state standards. Assigned tasks are rigorous and demand students to use higher order thinking skills. This 
has resulted in providing multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate their thinking and strong academic 
habits. (1.1) promising practice that is evidenced by-Teacher teams review plans and use inquiry time to unearth 
strengths and weaknesses, Defining rigor (focus on thinking), Focused on high quality,Thinking process made visible 
and students engaged in Productive struggle. In most of the classrooms, there is coherent alignment between 
curricula materials, respect for how students learn best, and feedback based on the Danielson Framework for 
Teaching. This has increased opportunities for students to interact with peers in order to work through challenging 
material more frequently and successfully. (1.2) 

Next steps: Continue to strengthen the data inquiry conversation in order for the vast majority of teachers to use and 
create assessments aligned to the curricula allowing more effective decisions to be made on instruction. (2.2) Ensure 
that : Teachers are providing feedback to students that state next steps, Aligning common assessments across grades, 
teachers are making adjustments to lessons based on student performance. 

Support the facilitation of easily accessible assessment systems 
Support the facilitation of accountability systems for student work and data with teachers. 

 
 
  Monitor the progress of students at several times of the year and engage teachers in discussions about 

student outcomes. 

  Continue to build on the increased student performance and set goals that are discussed with the school 
community that reflect growth over time. Create additional artifacts that capture data in order to visually 
represent where students are towards instructional goal attainment 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Our strategies to attract Highly Qualified Teachers are embedded in or administrative practices. It is our intent to 
support teachers by following set of performance standards that are imbedded in a research based framework that 
will enhance teacher skills and move them towards full proficiency. When necessary, we make use of the Title I set 
aside funds for assisting teachers to achieve a Highly Qualified designation. If we have the opportunity to hire a new 
pedagogue we conduct a rigorous interview process where our levels of expectation are made clear at the onset. Our 
questioning of candidates exemplify our standards and tests the knowledge base and experience of the candidate 
Before being hired, a demo lesson is scheduled and observed by the administration. As we train and develop our new 
teachers, they are told, that they will be observed a minimum of eight times per year to support their development 
and enhance their teaching effectiveness. While teaching, they are directed to maintain daily detailed lesson plans for 
instruction and rubrics for assessment. It is our expectation that all our Highly Qualified pedagogical staff maintain the 
highest degree of competency to strengthen our instructional core, increase student achievement and meet our 
school wide goals

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Coordinating the professional development activities of preschool and kindergarten teachers in order to align pre-
kindergarten and kindergarten curricula and goals. Kindergarten and pre-kindergarten teachers are scheduled to visit 
each other’s classrooms; and The Pre K teacher provides the future kindergarten teacher with children’s work folders 
or a written record of their learning during preschool. 

Information about a child’s experience in Pre K is shared with Kindergarten teachers especially in cases where a child 
may need extra support in order to experience success in school.  

Documentation of steps taken to help children progress toward his or her program goals while in Pre K, and a 
discussion of areas where the child is still experiencing difficulty. 

Preschool and kindergarten teachers and other support staff meet to discuss children on a case by case basis in order 
to facilitate the student's adjustment to a new classroom situation by discussing strategies to support the child and by 
sharing ideas that have been successful with this child in the past. 

The activities that increase coordination between the neighborhood preschools and PS 20 will include:  

- Developing and implementing a systematic procedure for receiving student records.  

- Establishing channels of communication between PS 20 school staff and their counterparts (including teachers, social 
workers, and health staff)  

- Joint registration activities and parent information nights held throughout spring so families understand the 
transition process.

At the start of the year the MOSL committee selects the assessments and presents their choices to the faculty. This 
year each child is assessed using the Fountas and Pinnell Running Record assessment, the NYC Performance Based 
Assessment in Writing and Math and Benchmark assessments. The data is then analyzed so that whole class, small 
group and individual instructional activities can be planned. Throughout the year, at weekly planning meetings our 
teachers examine student work in collaborative inquiry teams in order to plan immediate instructional next steps as 
well as long-range next steps involving planning for the next grade. During small group work, students are provided 
with work on their level. Ongoing student observations "kid watching" while children are involved in all classroom 
activities is a regular activity. observational / conference notes are kept on each student weekly and plans are 
adapted to meet individual student’s. Formative and summative assessment data is used to support student 
achievement. Data is collected on individual children, by class and grade-level as well as by sub-group (gender, 
demographics, and lowest third). Teachers determine the Individual learning goals for each child. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K020, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

The Clinton Hill School, PS 20 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use and navigation of various data bases and web sites such as, Engage NY, NYC Schools Account; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1.  At PS 20 students' early literacy skills are assessed via Standardized test data in ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies, 
through The Fountas and Pinnell:  Reading Assessment System 1, Fundations, LAB R (Spanish), NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Teacher 
Made Assessments, MOSL and The Gifted and Talented formative assessments and are all analyzed and used to inform and 
drive instructional practices and our instructional plan.  The data reveals that ELLs used to perform lower on these 
assessments than the English native speakers in our building but in recent years are closing this gap and even outperforming 
their English Native Speakers.  While an ELL may score an "Transitioning" or even "Expanding" level of proficiency on the 
NYSESLAT or NYSITELL they mat still be functioning below grade level on the early literacy assessments.  ELLs are reading 1-3 
years below grade level proficiency.  It is noted by research the ELLs will require 3- years of language services to gain grade 
level proficiency.   In content areas, the ENL teacher monitors the understanding of linguistically challenging material and uses

a variety of phrasings and synonyms to clarify meaning.  As students work toward proficiency in English academic content for 
all students, including ELLs is challenging.  Engaging and presented through well developed learning strategies that incorporate 
the use of their native language, when applicable, cognates and ENL methodology and instructional practices to shelter 
language and make content across the curriculum more comprehensible without sacrificing academic rigor.  In math, extra 
time and scaffolds are devoted to the untangling of difficult word problems, and students are required to make verbal 
explanations of these problems to encourage writing in the content areas and metacognition.  In Social Studies, teachers 
scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase comprehension for ELLs. ipads, 
smartboards, software,  online tools, listening centers and other forms of technology are utilized to make learning 
accessible.   These students also receive additional support in both reading and writing through small group instruction 
provided by the Coaches and staff members  for testing grades 3-5.  Small group instruction for lower grades may focus on 
moving the child toward grade-level proficiency and state recognized benchmarks of Common Core Performance Indicators, 
MOSL and Standardized assessments.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Classroom teachers are required and scheduled to complete assessments and achieve benchmarks to guide instruction.  The 
ENL teacher works with the Testing Coordinator to Administer The NYSESLAT to all eligible students in the spring, adhering to 
the Testing training, administration and scoring guidelines, within the assessment window set forth by The NYCDOE.  Teachers 
from five District 13 schools, coordinate to train and score the NYSESLAT and scan documents.  Classroom teachers and 
teachers of ELLs plan in coordinated team meetings scheduled in blocks to train, plan, score, and conduct RTI conferences and 
IEP meetings.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
3.  We review and analyze all assessment data and consider trends.  We examine how students are faring on standardized 
tests, whether they need academic intervention outside of RTI and analyze how long on average, it takes our ELLs to gain 
proficiency through the Freestanding ENL Pull-Out Model of instruction.  The trend over the last few years is that ELLs across 
the board are improving using this model.  Twenty to thirty percent are gaining proficiency in English in four years or less with 
intervention, RTI and ENL services.  It has been noticed that over thirty-five percent, across all grade spans improve a level in 
one year.  It has been noted that "Expanding" and "Commanding" students take longer to gain  proficiency without second 
language support.  The trend is that students remain at the Advanced and now Expanding level in at least one modality for two 
years before gaining proficiency.  The ELLs perform better at tasks involving listening and speaking in class as well as on 
Assessments.  When in small group settings with scaffolds and less peer influence, ELLs produce higher quality 
work.  Occasionally, ELLs will jump two proficiency levels from Beginner to Advanced or Intermediate to Proficient using our 
current model.  Our Science scores have helped our AYP.  ELLs tend to score as well, if not better, on the Science than the ELL 
Periodic Assessments and the ELA.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The LPT team meets to discuss ELLs with IEPs within the first 20 days of enrollment.  The team of principals, teachers, 
counselors and parents determines whether or not we proceed with the NYSITELL, Spanish Lab-R (if applicable) and implement 
the most appropriate educational plan and placement for the student based on the assessment results, previous educational 
records, physician records, parental recommendations and input.  Interim assessments, progress monitors and report 
cards  throughout the year, put in place by the local and state guidelines, help gauge student progress, tailor learning activities, 
create goals and maintain records.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
5.  In addition to the ENL screening and identification process, ELLs undergo RTI screening to determine whether or not they 
will meet benchmarks.  If an ELL student shows deficiencies in literacy skills and academic competencies as a result of the 
screening, they are flagged as at risk and targeted for academic intervention.  We aim to foster growth in the particular area of 
weakness through an RTI plan which include the language acquisition and development pieces.  Additionally, periodic 
assessments and data are recorded for students in the RTI framework.  The examination and analysis of the data is continuous 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

by classroom and ENL teachers, to work together during common planning and in PDs to tailor instruction for our ELLs.  When 
progress is monitored, the expected rate of an ELL’s progress takes into account language development and educational 
history.  Teachers and school leaders can use data to determine when it is necessary to adjust instruction for all 
ELLs.  Knowledge of typical second language development and the student’s history of first and second language (e.g. 
educational background) is considered when setting benchmarks.  Our school uses data to guide instruction with the Response 
to Intervention (RtI) framework for grades K-5.  We use research based, Professionally taught, data driven instruction for all 
students, including ELLs at the Tier I, II, and III intervention levels, and incorporates language development to move ELLs and 
narrow academic gaps.  The school uses available and current data of all standardized tests and MOSL to guide instruction for 
ELLs within the classroom and create the RTI plan for flexible grouping, needs for differentiation, intervention and small group 
instruction throughout the day.  Data is considered when deciding what staff to group students with, to determine group sizes 
and to establish plans and implementation of instruction.  During team meetings or RTI discussions educators brainstorm 
possible scaffolds, differentiated activities and instructional methodologies to provide ELLs with practice gaining proficiency in 
the particular area and demonstrating their growth, understanding or mastery of it.  They aim to provide diverse methods to 
both teach it using the four modalities and have students gain mastery of it.  The implications for the school’s LAP and 
instruction are derived from the strengths and needs noted in the NYSESLAT and other assessments (NYSITELL, ACUITY, 
Teacher Assessments, teacher anecdotals, SBST evaluations, informal observations and input, as well as students' educational 
history and parental input).  We  utilize this data to guide instructional practices and programs and align Common Core State 
Standards within lessons to particular ELL needs within the Response to Intervention.  Teachers will use data to strongly target 
language development across the grades and content areas, creating opportunities for active, meaningful engagement and 
written opportunities for publishing and using academic language.  We observe needs for, additional support in listening skills 
for Newcomers.  We include an increased use of technological programs such as Wilson's Fundations in the lower grades, 
SmartBoards, ipads to help students build schema and make meaning of academic language.  We use Learning Style Surveys to 
see how each individual, uniquely learns and strive to differentiate within content, ability levels, product and assessment 
measures.  ELLs are encouraged to consider their various learning styles in project choice and in creating goals based on their 
NYSESLAT Modality Reports.  We will determine ways to provide differentiated activities to accommodate diverse learning 
styles and students will be encouraged to use their native language to strengthen their literacy skills and transfer rules to their 
second language by using itranslate, ipad resources, classroom buddies, bilingual dictionaries, visual references, oral 
interpretations and written translations and other classroom resources.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
6.  The NYSESLAT data shows that 100% of ELLs in the upper grades 3-5 are at the Transitioning or above or levels according to 
the 2017  NYSESLAT-excluding new students to the building.  Of all tested in 2017, every ELL made growth.  While four 
"Advanced ELLs" from 2016 have  remained ELLs at the "Expanding" or "Commanding" levels.  None, fell a proficiency level 
from 2016 to 17.  Typically, the new admits, after being assessed by the NYSITELL come in with proficiency levels of 
Entering.  An observation we have made this year is that students may be any level but perform better on the English NYSITELL 
than the Spanish assessment.   In analyzing the available data from The NYSESLAT reports in September, one-third of the ELLs 
tested had the lowest modality score report of Writing, followed by reading.  Aside from one kindergarten ELL and one third 
grade ELL, whose second lowest scores were in Speaking, students are mainly proficient in Speaking and Listening.  According 
to The Measures of Teacher Practice the ENL teacher has a HEDI Rating of "Highly Effective" in showing growth for State (All 
Grades, ENL).  There is no pattern nor correlation between number of years or service, nor grade span in terms of student 
growth percentile.  There is no correlation in the data between attendance percent and student growth percentile either, 
which is interesting.  Students utilize the data to create goals in lowest modalities and to understand that although they are 
ENL students, all modalities are increasing incrementally.  Students, with the ENL teacher analyzed their own data of the 
modalities, looked at their two lowest modalities and created individual S.M.A.R.T. Goals based on their data.  Students were 
taught how to speak to and articulate the data.  Students were taught to evaluate their strengths and weakness based on the 
data.  The ENL teacher utilized the data to inform instruction and set IPC goals with the administrators.  All students in the 
upper grades scored less than 50% on The ELA Benchmark for 2017.  They performed slightly better on the ELL Periodic 
Assessment.  The assessments will be analyzed by the ENL teachers and classroom teachers to inform instruction and the 
needs for classroom differentiation in lesson planning as well as Response to Intervention.       
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We hold scheduled and required IEP meetings, annual and triannual mandate meetings, weekly SIT, LPT meetings, daily 
teacher common planning meetings, PTA meetings every third Wednesday of each month, scheduled orientation meetings 
within the first ten school days, quarterly parent teacher conferences, and weekly Parent Engagement evenings are in place 
throughout the year to ensure the dissemination of our findings in order to evaluate and adjust our programs, consider the 
addition/elimination of materials, staff and resources provided to students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 a.  As stated, the population of ELLs is a mixture of Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding 
students in grades K-5.  All Students are instructed solely in English, grade/level appropriately or by ELL level based on 
the spring 2015 NYSESLAT by means of differentiation in content, delivery, process and product.  Services are 
provided by a dually certified ENL/English teacher two days a week in a Pull-Out setting with students working at 
individual levels, albeit at different age levels and supported through differentiated instruction.  ENL is provided for 
180 minutes per week for Transitioning and Expanding students whereby the time slot is blocked for such 
mandates.  The Commanding students receive .5 units of study per week in the said time block outlined for 
Transitioning and Expanding students and 360 minutes of ENL is blocked for our Entering and Expanding students 
through mixed grades as well as heterogeneous ENL levels broken up by Transitioning/Expanding and another of 
Entering/Emerging.  Students travel together by their group.  Support is offered through the ENL program utilizing 
strategies of sheltered English, TPR, and differentiation based on item analysis of available assessments.  Scaffolding: 
modeling, bridging, schema building, contextualization, text representation, and metacognition are also used to build 
and help expand students’ prior knowledge and schema.  Standardized test data through ACUITY, City and State 
formal, Predictive exams, and Teacher-made Assessments are all analyzed and used to inform and drive instructional 
practices of the classroom teacher and ENL provider.  Students establish their individual goals and work toward 
mastery with the support of scaffolds, visuals, differentiated instruction, small group instruction and self 
assessments.  In content areas, the ENL teacher monitors the understanding of linguistically challenging material and 
uses a variety of phrasings, synonyms, cognates and visuals to clarify meaning.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

b.   At this time we have Freestanding ENL and Dual Language French. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

c.  Dual Language ELLs are serviced in the ENL program depending on their proficiency level and their mandates with 
the ENL students by a dually certified ENL/English teacher.  They receive the other language by a bilingual French 
teacher.  Our ELLs in the Dual Language French program who are taught by a dually certified ENL/Common Branch 
teacher receive their ENL service through said teacher according to their mandates. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

a.  Services are provided by a dually certified ENL/English teacher two days a week in a Pull-Out setting with students working 
individual levels, albeit at different age levels and supported through differentiated instruction.  ENL is provided for 180 
minutes per week for Transitioning and Expanding students whereby the time slot is blocked for such mandates.  The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Commanding students receive .5 units of study per week in the said time block outlined for Transitioning and Expanding 
students and 360 minutes of ENL is blocked for our Entering and Expanding students through mixed grades as well as 
heterogeneous ENL levels broken up by Transitioning/Expanding and another of Entering/Emerging.  Students travel together 
according to their group. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The core content is delivered in English through the ENL program utilizing strategies of sheltered English, TPR, and 
differentiation based on item analysis of available assessments.  Scaffolding: modeling, bridging, schema building, 
contextualization, text representation, and metacognition are also used to build and help expand students’ prior knowledge 
and schema.  Standardized test data through ACUITY, City and State formal, Predictive exams, and Teacher-made Assessments 
are all analyzed and used to inform and drive instructional practices of the classroom teacher and ENL provider.  Students 
establish their individual goals and work toward mastery with the support of scaffolds, visuals, differentiated instruction, small 
group instruction and self assessments.  In content areas, the ENL teacher monitors the understanding of linguistically 
challenging material and uses a variety of phrasings, synonyms, cognates and visuals to clarify meaning.  
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

4.  Pairing students with Bilingual paras when applicable, parent and student interviews and using the LAB-R to evaluate 
language dominance, buddying students with speakers of their native language and pairing students in intervention with 
bilingual teachers of their native language are measures we utilize to appropriately evaluate ELLs  in their home languages.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5a.  PS 20 has no students who fall under SIFE, however the plan for students with interrupted education is to include them in 
the extended day reading and math sessions with groups and staff who speak their native language, place them, when 
possible with the bilingual paras, buddy them up with students who speak their native languages, and provide them with 
access to, and materials in their native language.  We aim to provide them with technology class whereby they can access 
programs for translation and information in their native language.  We would create individualized, student needs assessments 
and determine the need for RTI.  We would find it necessary to provide Professional Development for staff in the new ALLA 
assessment to identify SIFE students, as well as in strategies that benefit the SIFE population.  For SIFE ELLs, instruction is 
differentiated and scaffolding techniques are used in the classroom.  The teachers have been trained in Q-TEL and implement 
the scaffolding techniques learned in their daily instruction.  Because SIFE ELLs show more progress with hands-on activities, 
the teachers plan lessons that are project-based with native language support.  Visuals and 
graphic organizers are used to support the SIFE ELLs.  Differentiation in lessons include the planning, implementation, the 
visuals, videos, images for vocabulary, the student work products.  All lesson plans are differentiated in some way to meet the 
needs of SIFE ELLs depending on the targeted CCLS.  Picture dictionaries and bilingual glossaries are available in the 
classrooms.  In addition, we have a subscription to a library of e books in English and Spanish in the Capstone Publishing,  My 
Own Reader series. This series allows teachers to assess students’ lexile levels and matches them to SIFE-appropriate e 
books.  These books are high interest, low reading level readers in English and Spanish.  Some have audio recordings for 
additional support, where appropriate. This allows teachers to develop thematic units that increase in text complexity across a 
unit.  This increases the reading comprehension skills of SIFE students.  It also allows students the opportunity to read, both 
independently and with their peers, increasingly complex text 
 
5b.  For Newcomers, or a student who enters school mid-year,  it is our plan to include them in the support programs peer 
mediation on social skills periods and various software programs including but not limited to, Language First, Fundations and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

Rosetta Stone.  We incorporate test-taking skills into the built-in technology schedule.  We gather formative data and 
summative assessments and provide the following resources to facilitate the transition:  An informal Student 
Orientation/Welcome Back Assembly is recommended and we utilize a Buddy system, identifying a similar student in his/her 
class that will assist during the day.  An informal assessment is conducted to identify possible Academic Intervention 
needs.  The Parent Coordinator and Principal make attempts through memos, conversations and invitations for an open 
“Home/School” communication.  Classroom teachers and peers guide them through The 7 Habits and The Leader in Me 
Process.   
 
5c.  ENL students receiving four to six years of service at PS 20 are involved in at least one of these programs, if not all of the 
following.  The assessment for, and creation of an AIS plan with emphasis on the literacy and math components.  Grade 
appropriate instructional support materials and scaffolds in the General Ed classroom and in the Pull-Out ENL classroom, plus 
Differentiation of instruction across the content areas. 
 
5d.  For Long Term ELLs, the above remediation is encouraged and recommended.  ELLs continuing to need academic support 
will receive a PIP, personal intervention plan, developed by the AIS team.  An analysis of their scores on the current 
assessments, the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments will be done to assess their needs.  They will receive full services in the 
Pull Out model in ENL 
and continue to receive AIS services if targeted by The SIT Team/Intervention Team.  Our action plan for Long Term ELLs is an 
academic program, targeting reading and writing at least three days during the week, monitoring the progress of students in 
all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs, extended day reading and math sessions to promote academic 
language and skills and an increased, active involvement in The Leader in Me process. Differentiation in lessons include the 
planning, implementation, the visuals, videos, images for vocabulary, the student work products.  All lesson plans are 
differentiated in some way to meet the needs of Long Term ELLs depending on the targeted CCLS. 
 
5e.  Transitional ELLs' progress is monitored by the ENL provider via conferencing with the classroom teacher.  The students 
are periodically pulled out on an "as needed" basis to complete projects, get provided extended time, separate small-group 
setting, or provided small-group or one-one instruction in the ENL classroom.  In science the Cookshop program has added 
intervention for ELLs.  For the Transitional students there is still an emphasis on differentiation in the General Ed classroom, 
reducing, yet still providing some support through necessary scaffolds, monitoring of students by the ENL teacher, Academic 
Intervention in small group, instructional settings, differentiation across the content areas, and technology 
elective.  Commanding students are entitled to Testing Modifications and 90 minutes of Integrated ENL for an additional two 
years.  This can and must be provided by a dually certified teacher or through on integrated program with an ENL provider and 
Common Branch teacher.  Former ELLs that have reached Commanding Level students receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction 
per week for up to two years after exiting ELL status but are no longer required to take the NYSESLAT exam each spring. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
6.  We utilize flexible scheduling to create flexible groupings, small group instruction and provide additional supports to ELLs 
SWDs.  Additional support is provided by pairing students with appropriate staff members for intervention, as previously 
mentioned with individuals who share the same native language.  Assessment data is analyzed to guide instruction and 
students' growth and progress, monitored to inform instructional decisions about flexible grouping and declassification and 
"partial 
mainstreaming" of students, in order to ensure their educational rights are met within the least restrictive environment.  The 
native language is supported and used as a cultural resource by providing students opportunities to use native language in 
discussions, dramatic play, and other workshops, as well as supported through multi-lingual libraries, and the use of the 
internet and technology 
in native languages. 
 
Some instructional strategies used to assist ELLs in need of intervention are: modeled talk, scaffolding activities, use of visuals, 
informational charts, graphs, graphic organizers, audio-visual materials, computer software programs and built-in intervention 
programs within the school day.  The math and literacy coaches have scheduled periods throughout the day to work with level 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

1 and 2s in math and ELA.  Support is offered through the ENL program utilizing strategies of sheltered English, TPR, and 
differentiation based on item analysis of available assessments.  Scaffolding: modeling, bridging, schema building, 
contextualization, text representation, and metacognition are also used to build and help expand students’ prior knowledge 
and schema.  In math, extra time is devoted to untangling difficult word problems, and students are required to make verbal 
explanations of these problems to encourage writing in the content areas and metacognition.  In Social Studies teachers 
scaffold 
their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase comprehension for ELLs.  Small group 
instruction for lower grades may focus on moving the child toward grade-level proficiency and state recognized benchmarks of 
proficiency of English language skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing as well as reading components such as, 
phonemic awareness, 
phonics, letter recognition, comprehension and critical thinking skills through Jump Start held Monday-Thursday from 8:00-
8:38 am. The Leader in Me process is implemented through lessons in the ESL classroom.  Standardized test data through TC 
Leveled Texts, LAB R, NYSESLAT, ACUITY, City and State formal, Predictive exams, and Teacher Made Assessments are all 
analyzed and 
used to inform and drive instructional practices of the general education teacher and ESL provider.  Students establish their 
individual goals and work toward mastery with the support of scaffolds, visuals, differentiated instruction, small group 
instruction and self assessments.  In content areas, the ESL teacher monitors the understanding of linguistically challenging 
material and uses a variety of phrasings and synonyms to clarify meaning as students work toward proficiency.  Building-wide, 
teachers have been trained in The Leader in Me.  The ENL teacher is in PS 20 three days a week. 
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
7.  Staff schedules and meets with the LPT Team and parents within the first 20 days to discuss potential ELLs with IEPs.  The 
SIT Team places the student in the least restrictive instructional environment based on the school's program, staff and 
licensure.  We use flexible scheduling to ensure that students mandates and needs are met according to their IEP and ENL 
mandates.  Currently our four ELLs with IEPs are in ICT/General Ed classrooms.  They are pulled out to receive ENL services and 
other services such as O.T., Speech and Language, P.T. and SETSS.  Schedules are created by The SIT Team Members and 
Service Providers so that services do not conflict. 
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
8.  The intervention services are offered in English with support, when possible with a student's Native Language.  The ENL 
population of ELLs is a mixture of Emerging through Commanding students.  All Students are instructed grade/level 
appropriately or by ELL level, based on the spring NYSESLAT by means of differentiation in content, delivery, process and 
product.  Services are provided by a dually certified ENL/English teacher two days a week in a Pull-Out setting with students 
working at individual levels and supported through differentiated instruction.  The RTI specialists and classroom teacher target 
students in need of intervention and provide them with small group assistance and differentiated instruction and strategic 
methods.  Support is offered through the ENL program utilizing strategies of sheltered English, TPR, and differentiation based 
on item analysis of available assessments.  Scaffolding: modeling, bridging, schema building, contextualization, text 
representation, and metacognition are also used to build and help expand students’ prior knowledge and 
schema.  Standardized test data through ACUITY, City and State formal, Predictive exams, and Teacher-made Assessments are 
all analyzed and used to inform and drive instructional practices of the classroom teacher and ENL provider.  Students establish 
their individual goals and work toward mastery with the support of scaffolds, visuals, differentiated instruction, small group 
instruction and self assessments.  In content areas, the ENL teacher monitors the understanding of linguistically challenging 
material and uses a variety of phrasings, synonyms, cognates and visuals to clarify meaning.  As students work toward 
proficiency in English, academic content for students is challenging, engaging and presented through well developed learning 
strategies in the classrooms and extended day programs that incorporate the use of their native language, when applicable, 
cognates and ENL methodology and instructional practices to shelter language and make content across the curriculum more

comprehensible without sacrificing academic rigor.  In math, extra time is devoted to the untangling of difficult word 
problems, and students are required to make verbal explanations of these problems to encourage writing in the content areas 
and metacognition.  In Social Studies, teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, images through 
technical means and illustrations to increase comprehension for ELLs.  These students also receive additional support in both 
reading and writing through small group instruction provided by the various staff members.  Small group instruction for lower 
grades may focus on moving the child toward grade-level proficiency and state recognized benchmarks of proficiency of 
English language skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing as well as reading components such as, phonemic awareness, 
phonics, letter recognition, comprehension and critical thinking skills through Remediation, The Leader in Me strategies and 
philosophy building-wide.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

9.  Adjustments and improvements to our program this year include:  we recognized a need for an on-site bilingual interpreter 
for new parents and hired a bilingual English-Spanish "Office Manager", we will continue to strongly target language 
development across the grades and content areas, creating opportunities for active, meaningful engagement and written 
opportunities for publishing and using academic language, to provide additional support in listening skills for Newcomers, 
including increased use of technological activities on the SmartBoard and ipads in the classroom, utilize ACUITY individualized 
practice tests in math and ELA, continue assessing and analyzing data for small group Academic Intervention classes in ENL to 
target language modalities according to their needs, provide Academic Intervention Services for "the bottom third" students 
performing below grade level during the school day as well as extended hours, and implement scaffolding strategies learned in 
Professional Development Workshops in content areas. 
The school is working to improve "Needs Assessments" for Parents, Parental Involvement for second language parents, the 
gardening program in conjunction with GrowNY as well as fine tune The Leader in Me process.  We hope to grow our dual 
language program by one grade a year.  We will continue growing our DL Program into the next grade.  We will continue and 
improve our Studio in Art and Band electives to foster the Arts, we will promote Health and Wellness through fitness activities 
while including parents and the community.  We will strive to involve parents in scheduled parent workshops and training 
sessions during Parent Engagement time blocks.  We will strive to create an interactive website for parents which allows for 
more accessibility and communication between parents, teachers, data and the school environment.  We will improve our 
parent outreach through parent surveys, feedback and discussions that are on-going throughout the year. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

10.  No programs for ELLs will be discontinued at this time.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
11.  In order to support learning and foster community involvement, PS 20 utilizes a portion of funding to create 
supplementary programs for ELLs and their families to enjoy and participate in.  ELLs and their parents are encouraged through 
bilingual letters/School Calendar to attend all: assemblies, arts programs, Band performances, scholarship programs, contests, 
auctions, fund raisers, holiday events, Spring Flings, art exhibits, showcases, awards assemblies, Open School Nights, B.E.A.R. 
Day, Field Days, field trips and incentive activities whether they are embedded within the framework of the school day or 
extended day or on weekends.  All ELLs are embraced and celebrated at PS 20 and invited to participate in and attend all 
school-wide events that are afforded to every other child at PS 20.  Activities to assist new ELLs are: registration day 
information/Literature, Welcome Back Assembly, invitation to orientation.  Translation and Interpretation Services are offered 
to increase the involvement of parents in the program.  Additional funding is available to translate important policy 
documents.  Native language support is provided  through a buddy system.  Other interpretation is offered through bilingual 
staff members, a bilingual "Office Manager", a multilingual library when necessary and bilingual dictionaries, listening centers 
and Ipad Software and applications.  Translators for parents at any school wide event are available upon request and would be 
contacted through the Translation and Interpretation Unit in Long Island City, done by the school's Language Acquisition 
Coordinator, if they cannot be accommodated by members of our staff.  This is accessible by telephone contact or 
internet.  The persons responsible for accessing translators or interpreters would be the Parent Coordinator, The Language 
Acquisition Coordinator or the PS 20 Administrators.  Translators for parents at any school wide event are available upon 
request and would be contacted through the Translation and Interpretation Unit in Long Island City.  Translators for parents at 
any school wide event are available upon request and would be contacted through the Translation and Interpretation Unit's 
direct connection with a language line @ 1-855-249-9103.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
12.  The instructional materials available for general education students are available to all ELLs.  The Freestanding ENL 
program does not use a particular text, but encourages literacy instruction as an element within the framework of The 
Common Core State Standards and curriculum maps.  Other materials such as: visuals aids, informational charts, graphs, 
graphic organizers, audio-visual materials, hands-on art materials are included for language development.  The use of “non-
fiction” materials is aligned to the ELA exam.  The materials selected and utilized for instruction are aligned with the State and 
City ESL Standards and information compiled through data analysis.  Purchased materials used to familiarize students with 
various state assessments have included: Attanasio and Associates Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond, New York 
State Coach: ELA, New York State Coach: Mathematics, The Leader in Me, Fundations, Passport Voyager, Leap Frog and The 
Wilson Program.  
 
The ENL teacher utilizes her Teacher's Choice funds and much 'out of pocket' expense to supplement the ELL classroom and 
provide multi-sensory learning experiences and project-based learning ie. paints, modeling clay, plaster of paris, pumpkins, 
apples, baking materials and ingredients, hot plates, crock pots, technology hardware (ipad), that make the educational 
program comprehensible to ELLs.  The technology, art, science, music and physical education electives are embedded in the 
ELL student schedules.  Additional support provided to the ELLs at PS 20 consists of paras in the ICT classrooms.   
 
The instructional materials to be utilized this year are EngageNY, Envisions Math and Ready Gen ELA.  Supplemental Materials 
include:  Responding to Literature Writing and Thinking Activities, Strategies for Understanding Non fiction, Six Traits 
Writing.  All prescribed programs are compatible with the SmartBoard which is accessible in most classrooms.  Itranslate and 
bilingual software applications are used on the ipads of Common Branch teachers and the ESL teacher.  Students are enrolled 
from grades 2-5 in a Standards based Technology elective.  Some instructional strategies used, but not limited to are: modeled 
talk, scaffolding activities, use of visuals, informational charts, graphs, graphic organizers, audio-visual materials, hands-on art 
experiences with language development, and use of “non-fiction” materials aligned to the ELA exam.  The materials selected 
and utilized for instruction are aligned with the State and City ESL Standards and Common Core Standards and information 
compiled through data analysis.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

13.  ELLs are embraced and celebrated at PS 20 and Native language support is embedded in the programs and procedures 
such as: Family Celebrations/Assemblies, the Spanish Lab-r, Standardized tests in native languages, parent brochures, and 
cultural field trips.  The materials selected and utilized for instruction are aligned with the State and City ENL Standards and 
Common Core State Standards as well as information compiled through data analysis.  Student diversity is respected and 
celebrated through the support of their native language development and heritage, through celebrations, research, arts, 
dance, multi-lingual libraries, itranslate programs on the iphone and ipads.  At PS 20 events, the school and community can 
come together to recognize student achievements in attendance, cultural arts and academics.  Native language support is 
provided  through a buddy system, interpretation offered through bilingual staff members, a multilingual library, bilingual 
dictionaries,  NYU Steinhardt glossaries and listening centers.  Parent Workshops and conferences through the OELL and 
NYC are advertised and posted by fliers in Native Languages and encouraged by our school via the Parent News Bulletin 
Board.   
 
Starting in Kindergarten, students take books home in the native language to read independently.  In addition, students 
struggling with vocabulary development are encouraged to take home a variety of books/texts for their parents to read aloud 
in their native language.  The Dual Language program also incorporates aspects of the French national curriculum to challenge 
advanced French-dominant students in their native tongue, especially in phonics, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.  Native 
language support is fostered through Concerts and Assemblies whereby students demonstrate their fluency through songs and 
performances. 
 
Our ENL teacher supports native language development by sending books home in Spanish (our dominant language other than 
French), providing phonics flash cards and games in Spanish to take home, and giving the Scholastic magazine “Que Tal?” to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59

learning support in French, German and Spanish through Scholastic on www.maryglasgowplus.com.  New purchases of Star 
Fall and Rosetta Stone to use with Immigrants are purchased through The Immigration Fund. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

14.  Students are registered, tested (NYSITELL based on age appropriate grade level) and placed in age and grade appropriate 
levels as per CR Part 154 mandates.  Students are tested with standardized tests, end of chapter tests and challenged with 
work based on their appropriate grade.  All their required services are scheduled and based on the age appropriate grade and 
group they travel within.  Lessons may be differentiated based on a student's ability, performance or ELL level of English 
proficiency. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
15.  The instructional materials available for general education students are available to all ELLs.  The Freestanding ESL 
program does not use a particular text, but encourages literacy instruction as an element within the framework of The 
Common Core State Standards and curriculum maps.  Other materials such as: visuals aids, informational charts, graphs,

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
16.  Newly enrolled ELLs are greeted by a bilingual "Office Manager" upon arrival, they are paired up with a classroom buddy 
and also a staff member who shares their common native language.  We pair students with bilingual paras when 
necessary.  we enroll new ELLs in scheduled periods of the arts and foreign language electives whether by community based 
partnerships like GrowNY and Studio in Art or in-house French class.  They are welcomed by our Parent Coordinator who 
provides them a tour of the building.  The guidance counselor provides them their class and schedule.  The ENL provider makes 
their acquaintance and completes a language interview and brief questionnaire.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

17.  The French elective is offered at PS 20.

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a.  The Dual language model used in the school's K-2 grade French program is self-contained.  The 
emergent literacy taught is sequential.  In the morning lessons are taught in French and in the afternoon 
Math is done in English, along with all other afternoon lessons.  All afternoon lessons are taught in 
English, as are all lessons taught by specialty teachers.  Out of the 28 periods during which these students 
are with their classroom teacher (not including lunch, specialty teacher classes, and Friday clubs), half are 
taught in French and half are taught in English. 
b.  Reading and Writing and routines in content areas are taught in French, whereas content areas of 
Math, Science, Social Studies and Specialty classes are taught in English. 
c.  At PS 20 we believe that students acquire language, knowledge and build schema through experiences 
with children their age and therefore do  not linguistically separate them.  Students receive 50% of their 
instruction in French and 50% of their instruction in English from the classroom teacher.  In the 
Kindergarten dual language classroom students are instructed in French in the morning and English in the 
afternoon.  On alternate days, this switches to the alternate language in the am. and the reverse in the 
pm. Native language arts and social studies are taught in French; English language arts and math are 
taught in English.  20-30 minutes/day are devoted to Math in French and Social Studies in English to 
support academic language development in the second language.  Language Arts is integrated with Social 
Studies and Science to encourage higher academic vocabulary acquisition and use.  Specialty subjects are 
taught in English, such as Art, Science, and P.E.  Music is taught in both French and English in the 
kindergarten dual language classroom.  All students have a specialty class once a day. 
d.  Dual Language Model:  Because we strongly believe in first, the development of native language 
literacy and then second language literacy, our program has a self-contained dual language class in 
K.  Students alternate between one class and the other on an alternate day schedule. e. Sequential Bi 
literacy:  PS 20 follows a sequential bi literacy approach fostering native language literacy first and the 
second language literacy next.  The French dominant students learn to read in French first, and English 
dominant students learn to read first in English.    
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic

meetings, Professional Development days and grade conferences, where the ENL teacher, provides information using 
researched based strategies for assisting ELLs in the general Education classroom via an organized PD Development binder 
provider by DOE ELL Instructional Support personnel.  Teachers are required to maintain a professional development section in 
a Data binder with certificates of attended Professional Development. For school staff we provide in-service within the school's 
Professional Development program with the focusing on the literacy needs of our ELL population.  Sessions are also given in 
Math and Science in scaffolding instruction through the use of manipulatives and experiments.  Technology sessions instruct 
content area teachers how to use online resources to make instruction more comprehensible.  The Leader in Me Training is 
pertinent to all teachers of ELLs.  Support Personnel Workshops taken by teachers on our staff have included: Scaffolding in 
the content areas, Differentiation in the ENL classroom, and ESL in the Mathematics classroom.  Our ELL teacher attends a 
variety of off-site workshops to promote collaboration between content area and language teachers.  These include but are

1.  During Parent Involvement from 2:40-3:20 one day a week, parents of ELLs may come and meet with individual classroom 
teachers, the ENL provider and Parent Coordinator to discuss grades, progress, language proficiency results of The NYSITELL or 
NYSESLAT modalities and how they affect the teaching and learning of their children.  There are provisions for translation 
through in-house staff members when available or through The Translation and Interpretation Unit mentioned above.  Parents 
are invited to all assemblies, performances, PTA meetings and outreach events hosted by the school.  We track meetings 
school-wide through "The Parent Meeting Attendance" document.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2.  In order to support learning and foster Parental Involvement, PS 20 utilizes a portion of funding to create supplementary

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lena Barbera, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

All newsletters and fliers are sent home in a bilingual format (English/Spanish). Several bilingual school personnel 
act as translators. Parents are entitled to language translators when necessary as per Chancellor’s Regulations. 
Communication is posted in main office as per translation and interpretation guidelines. Parents are surveyed 
through DOE "Preffered Language Form" as to their language prefence for correspondence. Information is 
recorded on Appendix K of The EPIC Tool Kit on a poster in the main office and hard copies of parent information, 
choice and data are compiled, kept and compared by the ENL teacher, the Parent Coordinator, and the Pupil 
Secretary.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

the first Curriculum Night in September and met by the ENL service 
provider. Each classroom teacher addresses the needs of parents at the 
initial Curriculum Night in September with a schoolwide survey on 
meeting their needs and concerns for a positive and open exchange to 
start the year. These needs are addressed and at PTA meetings and 
Showcases, it is the expectation that the initial surveys are monitored 
and revisited in a "How are we doing?" format. Documentation for 
translation and interpretation through Long Island City is available at the 
website: 
intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.

translation and interpretation services by downloading and disseminating a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and 
Responsibilities and Parents’ Guide to Language Access in their language of need as made available by the Office of 
Translation and Interpretation. The school will also have Welcome Posters in each of the most prominent covered 
languages, including in English, in those languages which may not be covered by the Office of Translation and 
Interpretation, indicating the availability of interpretation services. Furthermore, the school’s safety plan will contain 
procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language assistance services are not prevented from reaching the 
school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers. A Language ID Guide will be kept at the security desk 
and main office. All notification documents can be found at the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site: 
intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.
