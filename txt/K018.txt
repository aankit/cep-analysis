Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission statement for Public School 18 is "At PS 18 we believe that high expectations of today nurture successful 
citizens of tomorrow." We believe in excellence for all of our children." PS 18 is an intimate learning environment 
committed to continuing its tradition of excellence in educating children and supporting its staff and community. 
Given the proper conditions, all children are capable of learning. We provide a safe orderly environment where each 
child is respected and provided with rigorous academic experiences where thinking skills are developed. We are 
committed to providing a learning environment that promotes language diversity and celebrates cultural differences 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

to develop the linguistic and cultural college and career readiness skills needed to function in a global society. At PS 
18, we provide experiences that serve as the stepping stones to good citizenship for tomorrow’s leaders. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Public School 18 is located in Williamsburg Brooklyn in Community School District 14. The school serves 190 students 
from Pre K – 5th grade. The school’s population is comprised of 81% Hispanic, 17% Black, 1% Asian and 1% white with 
16% of those students identified as English Language Learners (ELLs) and 40% identified as Students With Disabilities 
(SWD). Because of the unique size of the school there is one class per grade, with the exception of Kindergarten and 
first grade.  

Public School 18 offers a series of programs to support social and emotional development. Positive Behavior 
Intervention System (PBIS) uses positive reinforcement to support appropriate behavior. Class Dojo is used to 
communicate positive behavior with parents and support students with developing a growth mindset. The Power 
Brain program is used to empower adults and children to use Brain Education (BE) to maximize their innate brain 
potential to promote health, happiness and peace on an individual, community and global level. This year we are 
implementing the Ruler social emotional curriculum to provide direct instruction on strategies to help students 
identify their feelings and regulate their behavior. 

Public School 18 values community partnerships. We have a collaborative relationship with St. Nick’s Alliance. They 
provide an after-school program for 75-100 of our students Monday through Friday. St. Nick’s also chose P.S. 18 to 
pilot their NABE 3.0 program. Through NABE 3.0 we have two full time social workers who support students and their 
families. St. Nick’s provides housing, job training, and mental health services to our families. This partnership has 
allowed us to provide community school services without community school money. We have a relationship with City 
Year and they also painted a series of murals around the building. The school environment is inviting and conducive to 
learning. Each year Met Life donates schools supplies to our students and Pencil provides financial literacy workshops 
for our students in grades 3-5. The school has a relationship with the Goethe Institut Galli Theater, and Lufthansa 
Airline to support the German language program.  

To support computer science and STEM education this year, PS 18 is part of the Computer Science For All (CS4All) 
initiative. The goal of the CS4All program is to ensure that all NYC public school students learn computer science. The 
program has an emphasis on female, black, and Latino students so they are better prepared to utilize computer 
science after graduation. This program will prepare students to engage in a true STEM program utilizing the school's 
new state of the art technology lab and learn coding using the school's robot, "Alex". This year we have a technology 
and Science cluster to further support computer science and STEM instruction. 

To support our work with using assessment to guide instruction, we have a partnership with Teaching Matters to 
utilize Mastery Connect, a computerized program that tracks student mastery of standards. Last year teachers 
received twenty coaching days throughout the year. This year, a consultant will provide 5 coaching days throughout 
the year to support the implementation of the program.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have 11 classes, 5 of them are ICT and 2 of them are self-contained 12:1:1 classes. The student population is 40% 
students with disabilities (SWD) and that number is climbing. Our students need small group instruction, a modified 
curriculum, social emotional support and a sensory room. Some of our students need headphones to muffle out 
sound and behavior intervention plans.  

We have a small population of German students and is growing our German Language Program. This year we have a 
Spanish/English Dual Language class and an English/German language class in both Kindergarten and First grade. We 
also have Spanish Dual Language in second and third grades. 

Our English as a New Language (ENL) program provides both push-in and pull out support for students. This model 
provides students with tools and scaffolds to acquire language that is connected to what is being taught in the 
classroom and provides the opportunity for individualized instruction when pulled out to further support their 
individual needs in language development.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

PS 18 made the most progress in 2017-2018 school year in Trust. 

This year, our focus is on rigorous instruction and providing a supportive environment.  

With the help of our Assessment Matters consultant, teachers spent a lot of time identifying gaps in learning by 
implementing protocols to review data and modify instruction based on that information.  

If we want our school environment to be supportive to students and families, we need to improve how we support 
the social emotional needs of our students. We will be working on creating a school-wide program to support 
students with regulating their emotions. With a large percentage of SWD (40%), this support is needed so students 
are able to learn.

*While teachers collaborate, it can be difficult to organize because there is only 1 class per grade (with the exception 
of Kindergarten and first grade).  

*Professional development sessions on Monday have been mostly whole group or grade band (k-2 & 3-5), not 
providing sufficient time for teachers to collaborate or work together in PLCs. 

School’s Priority Needs: 

Finding time for teacher teams to meet consistently. 
Implementing protocols to ensure teachers stay focused and on task. 

 
 
  Consistently looking at student work and implementing next steps to modify curriculum and lessons. 

School’s Strengths: 

  Teachers have created a student centered culture where decisions are responsive to student performance. 
  The work of cross grade teacher teams has strengthened teacher collaboration resulting in improvements to 

pedagogical practices and a stronger voice in key decisions affecting student learning. 

  Teachers across grades have been brought together to form a teacher leadership team where teachers 

collaborate to make decisions about instruction. 

  The use of protocols to analyze Mastery Connect data guides teachers in pinpointing students' needs in 

relation to CCLS. 

  Assessment Matters coaching has developed teacher leadership in facilitating teacher team meetings. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of the teachers in Grades K-5 will work in grade band teams (K-1, 2-3 & 4-5) to analyze data and 
adjust curriculum with the focus of improving student learning and their teaching practice.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

This year, the professional development calendar will reflect 
monthly teacher team meetings and data talks to analyze data 
on a consistent basis. 

Teachers will use various protocols (ATLAS, item analysis, and 
notice and wonder) to review student work. Based on the 
analysis of the data, teachers will revise unit maps and lessons to 
include strategies that support the needs of all subgroups. The 
implementation of the Teacher Leader Team and strategic 
planning sessions with the principal will further support this work 
this school year.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment: Teachers are recruited using the open hire system and from various colleges. A rigorous interview 
process where candidates have to teach a demo lesson and are rated using the rubrics for the Danielson Framework 
for Teaching is used. Also, the candidates experience with the curriculum being taught and modifying curriculum is 
also considered when recruiting teachers. Most new hires are asked to work as substitute teachers before being 
offered a permanent teaching position. 

Retention: Teachers are developed using a differentiated professional development plan to ensure their continued 
growth towards becoming master teachers. 

Assignments: Teachers are matched with assignments where they have experience, expertise, or interest. The 
assignment of the staff also considers what is in the best interest of students.  

Support: Teachers are supported through professional development designed to ensure that the staff is highly 
qualified. Some of the professional development activities include: 

*Professional development PLCs around the Danielson Framework for Teaching components 1a, 3B, 3C and 3D will be 
ongoing throughout the year. 

*Peer Collaborative Teachers will provide coaching to teachers who need assistance.  

*Teachers set personal goals for improvement and identify specific tasks they will engage in to support meeting those 
goals.  

Professional development is also offered to paraprofessionals to ensure they have the knowledge necessary to 
function in the capacity of educational assistants. Paraprofessionals receive training in behavior management, 
facilitating small group work, guided reading and all instructional initiatives. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).

The Preschool curriculum is aligned to the Pre-Kindergarten foundational Standards which are a foundation to the 
Common Core Standards. The Pre-Kindergarten units are modified to ensure that students are instructed in skills 
needed in the next grade.  

 

The Preschool curriculum has been modified to include a Spanish and German language immersion component to 
support students' readiness for the Spanish dual language program and the German Language Enrichment program in 
Kindergarten. 

 

The Preschool curriculum has been supplemented with a program that reinforces letter recognition and sounds to 
support the transition to Kindergarten. 

 

Pre-Kindergarten teachers often participate in professional development with teachers of grades K-5 and apply the 
content to the Preschool curriculum to ensure they are supporting the instructional program. 

 

Kindergarten teachers have an opportunity to meet with Pre-Kindergarten teachers to discuss gaps in instruction so it 
can be addressed the next year via modification of instructional expectations. 

 

Once per month Pre-Kindergarten parents are invited to attend parent workshops to support the home school 
connection. Some of the topics include what to expect in kindergarten and ways to support learning at home. 

 

Teachers conduct child studies to address the needs of the students who may need intervention services.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Creation of 3 teacher leader positions: P.S. 18 has vertical grade meetings because there is one class on some grades. 
There is a teacher leader for grades K-1, 2-3 and 4-5. The teacher leaders meet with me to discuss assessment 
practices and then discuss those systems with the other teachers on the grade to get feedback. The teacher leader for 
grades 4-5 is also the data specialist and a Peer Collaborative Teacher. This system allows teachers to share feedback 
and participate in the decision making process regarding what assessments will be administered, when and how to 
track it. 

 

There is a measures of student learning committee who meet to make recommendations to the principal regarding 
MOSL assessments and how they should be administered. One of the team members will attend professional 
development through the Field Support Center to support their understanding of the various assessments available 
and will turnkey that information to the other team members so they can make informed decisions. Also, the data

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 14K018 Edward Bush, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 18 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

 Students in K-5 will receive enrichment through the arts during an after school program.  This 
program will meet the educational needs of the 30 ENL students.  The purpose of the Theatre 
Arts program is to  develop all modalities of our  ENL population.  Addressing all modalities, 
will enable students to make gains in  all academic areas.   The program will run for 17 weeks on 
Wednesdays for 2 hours (2:30 - 4:30 pm.).  The program will being January 16th and End with a 
culminating activity on May 29th.  There will be 2 groups of students.  One group will consist of 
entering/ low emerging and the second group will consist of high emerging/ 
intermediate  level  students.   Because groups will be formed based on language acquisition 
level, each group will have students from various grades.  During the program, students will be 
exposed to different genres and will participate in readers' theater and visual art.  The 
entering/low emerging group will participate in visual arts and the high emerging/intermediate 
group will participate in readers' theater.   There will be 1 certified ENL teacher and 2 certified 
content area teacher working the program.   During the program, each group will spend 1 hour 
with the content area teacher and the other hour with the ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher will 
deliver direct instruction in literacy and math.  The drama teacher will work with students to 
perform readers' theater.  The visual arts teacher will work with students to create an art piece 
tied to literacy.  Students will receive 1 hour of enrichment and 1 hour of direct instruction.  
Rationale: 
The program aims to provide additional support for students to reach proficiency and make gains 
on State exams and provide additional language instruction to help students make gains on the 
NYSESLAT.  It is our goal that students at the entering level will make substantial gains by 
immersing them in Read Aloud, language exposure,  and developing their listening and speaking 
skills through a myriad of activities.  Students will be grouped by language proficiency levels in 
order to meet the specific language needs of students. A flexible grouping model will be used for 
providing direct instructions to ELLs by ENL and content area teachers. This will help us to 
meet the varying language development skill needs of our ELLs.  Enrichment will be offered to 
provide additional language support through the arts.  Research shows that through the arts the 
students academics will be improved . Enrichment will also provide social and emotional support 
to help students feel more comfortable in a school setting.  The ELLs will be provided direct 
instruction in two sessions.  During the first hour, instruction will be dedicated exclusively to 
language development strategies by the ENL teacher.  During the second hour, the  content area 
teacher will provide instruction in readers theatre or visual arts.  Readers' theatre and Visual Arts 
will provide opportunities for students to develop language and support the Common Core State 
Standards in literature.     
Subgroups:  The total ELLs for Sept. 2018 is 30, including 2 former ELLs who passed the 
NYSESLAT.     
Upon analyzing the NYSESLAT data of 2018, we find that the students still need additional 
support with reading comprehension and writing.   Instruction will be provided in the classrooms 
as well as working with the ENL teacher. Strategies that will support our students will be as 
follows;

Schedule and duration of After-school:  The after-school program will begin in January 2019 and 
conclude in June 2019.  It will run for 17 weeks, 2 hours per week (2:30 - 4:30 pm) on 
Wednesday afternoons. 
 Language of Instruction:   English will be the main language of instruction.  Occasionally, 
materials such as chants, rhymes, poetry and excerpts will be provided from authentic literature 
in the children's native language (Spanish and German).  
Nature of activities: ELLs will be engaged in a variety of activities to promote their language 
skills.  The activities will include: processed writing in a variety of genres aligned to their main 
curriculum.  They will also benefit from a balanced literacy approach in reading with selections 
from informational  literature.  Read alouds and Article of the Day will boost their listening and 
speaking skills. The enrichment part of the program will include hands on activities, writing and 
enactment of skits, tone, intonation, dialogue delivery, expressing feelings and ideas by watching 
and practicing the skills during drama sessions.  In Visual Arts students will engage in hands on 
activities where literacy is brought to life through Art.  Students will reinforced vocabulary, have 
opportunities for discussion to support the development of oral language.  Sentence frames will 
be used to support students with writing about their art. 
Teachers:  PS 18 has one New York State certified ENL teacher who will consult with content 
area teachers to support instruction.  All teachers providing services are certified.   
Types of materials:  The materials for after school enrichment programs will be aligned with the 
Common Core Learning Standards. We will use the "Language Power materials " to support our 
ELLs in reading and writing skills.  Leveled readers' theater materials will also be 
purchased.  Other supplemental materials will be ordered as needed (notebooks, pens, pencil, 
crayons, paper, visuals etc.). The materials will be purchased with Title III funds.  All materials 
to be used for the Title III program are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily 
instruction to ELLs.  The ratio of ELLs to teachers will be 14:1. 
Attendance folders will be distributed on a weekly basis to monitor the students' attendance. The 
attendance sheets will be added to the Title III binder kept in the Principal's office.

All teachers and paraprofessionals will attend professional development sessions once a month 
on Monday afternoons, during grade team meetings on strategies to support ELLs.  These 
professional development sessions will begin in October 2018 and there will be a total of 9 
sessions for a duration 30 minutes each session.  This year, the topics will focus on strategies to 
help students acquire academic language, planning scaffolds and creating language 
objectives.  Resource materials will be purchased with the Title III funds.  Professional 
Development is differentiated to meet the needs of every teacher and the students they 
service.  This will ensure that all teachers follow best practices to meet the needs of our ELL 
population.  Also,  teachers are encouraged to sign up for professional development by way of 
on- line courses through CITE, as well as the Field Support Center.  Professional development 
agendas and sign-in sheets will be kept in a professional development binder in the Principal's 
office.  Participants will be required to sign-in for each session.  Teachers will also submit 
agendas for any sessions attended outside of school.  The in-house professional development will 
be facilitated by the administration, the ENL teacher and the bilingual dual language teachers. 
This year, the staff will be reading the book Visible Learning for Literacy.  It supports using best 
practices to accelerate learning.  We also have a consultant from Go Math who will be working 
with teachers to support them with planning lessons with the appropriate scaffolds to support 
ELLS and SWD.  These coaching sessions are not being funded by Title III funds.  The 
vocabulary curriculum called Wordly Wise is also being used to support students with acquiring 
more vocabulary. 
The workshop  titles/topics will include, but are not limited to: 
Creating Language Objectives. (October 29, 2018 ~ 2:30 - 3:30) 
Supporting ELLs with improving their writing skills, using Thinking Maps and the writing 
process (November, Election Day PD) 
Academic language learning through Cognitive Academic Language Learning (CALLA) 
strategies (December 2019) 
ELL Data Review (January 2019) 
At the ELL data review session in January.  Data for all ELL students will be reviewed and a 
plan to address their needs will be created.  Based on the results of the data, the other 5 sessions 
(February - June) will be planned.  The purpose of this is to make sure teachers are supported 
with targeted professional development that is specific to the needs of the students.  
Teachers will receive a breakdown of the data for the ELL students in their class with 
recommended strategies they can use to support their students' language needs. 
The professional development plan will positively impact the progress of ELLs because they 
center on helping students acquire academic language and strategies to provide access to the 
content and standards. 
The ENL teacher will be instrumental in providing professional development to classroom 
teachers and paras.  Also, the ENL teacher will be participating in professional development 
hosted by the FSC to support her growth.  Strategies learned at these sessions will be shared with 
classroom teachers during grade meetings. 
Teachers of the Title III after-school program will be provided with time to plan and review 
student work to make adjustments for the next session.  Teachers will receive 30 min. at the start

are translated in their native language, and the school website provides information about 
upcoming events. 
Surveys will be distributed to parents to invite their comments, feedback and ideas on ways to 
strengthen school-home connection.  The feedback from parents is taken into consideration while 
planning topics to be covered during workshops for parents.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools being used to guide instructional planning for ELLs are Fountas and Pinnell running records,  sight word, 
letter sound correspondence, Raz Kids ELL component, NYSELAT scores and math assessments. In addition In our Dual 
Language class, Estrellita is used.  The data is analyzed and teachers use the language progressions to help them identify 
students strengths, weaknesses and plan appropriately for students' proficiency levels. 
Considering the NYSESLAT, our analysis of 4 modalities chose that a great majority of our ELL's, regardless of their grade 
developed high proficiency in speaking and listening. Furthermore, a number of our ELL's have moved proficiency levels. 
Our schools instructional plan is to focus on word study, academic vocabulary, and guided reading and writing, while 
implementing scaffolding techniques and ELL methodologies. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

The testing coordinator puts out a schedule with all testing and oversees this testing.  There are four benchmark assessments 
administered through out the year.  After each administration, teacher teams are scheduled to meet for a "data talk" where 
they analyze data and make adjustments to curriculum to support students' needs.  
This year the school is implementing school-wide formative assessments to assist with teaching and learning. In addition, the 
school will be training all faculty in the use of mastery connect; web based program that provides teachers with formative 
assessment data on real time. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
This past year 2016- 2017 our students made substantial gains, in all the subsets of the NYSESLAT. There were three students 
who moved from Emerging to Transitioning and one student who moved from Transitioning to Expanding. Most students also 
moved up 1-2 reading levels in the Fountas and Pinnell running records. In addition, we also studied our MOSL results which 
indicated that most students in grade 4 have attained proficiency in Science according to the NYS Grade 4 Science Test. This 
was attributed to professional development that was aligned to the Common Core Standards, tailored professional 
development to meet the needs of all teachers of ELLs. We purchased new materials that were aligned to the curriculum in 
our school.  In addition we developed rigorous lesson plans to support ELLs and SWDs.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered, teacher teams analyze data by looking at the item analysis of the NYS ELA test and 
create intervention plans to address the needs of students by way of differentiation.  Teachers develop tracking tools to assess 
the student mastery of the various skills. This data is also used to group students to facilitate the differentiation.  This data is 
shared with the ENL teacher so she can modify her plans as well. The ENL teacher discusses the needs of the ELL students with 
the content area teachers in order to create coherence in the instructional support of students in and out of the classroom. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Currently in grades K-5, the school is using an intervention curriculum by Fountas and Pinnell that provides intense literacy 
instruction in small group.  Teachers in grades K-5 also do independent reading with guided reading.  Assessment data is used 
to determine the type of support ELLs receive within these two programs. 
This year teachers will have a daily 30 min. period for small group work to address the individual needs of students. 
Our Tier ! RTI is provided by classroom teachers and supported by the ENL teacher. If a student does not make adequate 
progress, the schools RTI committee meets to discuss next steps to discuss the student. Those steps include Tier 2 and Tier 3 
instruction, which is provided by specialized out of classroom staff members. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
When looking at the NYSITELL, most children who have had schooling before Pre-K generally test out and do not need ENL 
services.  Prospective ELLs who enter the NYC School system for the first time usually do not pass this test and need ENL 
services.   
The NYSESLAT data reveals that students in grades K-2 generally remain at entering and emerging level. ELLs in grades 3-5 
make substantial gains, move to transitioning and expanding levels and some of them reach the commanding level and test 
out.  However, SIFE students and new immigrants generally make little gains in their first 2-3 years in the system.  After that 
they make good progress and move to higher proficiency levels.  The majority of our ELLs do well on the speaking sub set of 
the NYSESLAT.  However, new immigrants and SIFE lag behind on this sub set.  All ELLs, regardless of their sub group, struggle 
to make significant gains in the reading and writing subsets. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The data specialist is responsible for breaking down this data and disseminating it to teachers.  The ENL teacher also has a 
document that is used to report to teachers student scores for each modality on the NYSESLAT 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Paste response to questions here: 1a. The stand-alone ENL program model that is used at PS 18 is a combination of 
push-in and pull out.  The push-in model provides side-by-side support for students in their classroom, and the pull-
out model provides additional time-on-tasks to provide them with specific language skills and develop their academic 
language.  The ENL teacher pushes-into the classes where the ELLs are grouped heterogeneously. In the pull-out 
model the ELLs are grouped by their grade level, proficiency, age and needs.  The ENL teacher regularly holds 
conferences with students and other teachers and service providers of ELLs including the speech therapist to ensure 
consistency and to discuss a variety of ways to help ELLs develop language. 
  
To further support the students, we utilize a hands-on approach in math and science.  The classroom and ENL teacher 
apply ENL methodology and appropriate strategies to enhance second language acquisition.  A variety of scaffolding 
strategies are used to help students comprehend the content area subjects and boost their understanding of 
academic language. These include modeling, contextualization, graphic organizers, thinking maps, total physical 
response and role playing to increase language and literacy development.  All students have journals for reading, 
writing, science, math and all content areas are supported by teachers using scaffolding  from the point of students' 
needs. 
   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:  N/A  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:  The Spanish Dual Lanquage program will provide instruction in all content areas in 
both Spanish and English.  At Ps 18 the Kindergarten Dual Language program is a side by side model.  We strive to 
achieve a 50/50 ratio between EP and ELLs.  There are two kindergarten classes and there are EP and ELLs in both 
classes.  In the morning, one class receives English instruction while the other class receives Spanish instruction 
(Periods 1-3).  Period 4 students go to lunch.  After lunch the classes switch and receive instruction in the other 
language (periods 5, 6 and 7).  The class that received English instruction in the morning will receive Spanish 
instruction in the afternoon.  The class that received Spanish instruction in the morning will receive English instruction 
in the afternoon.  This structure changes weekly.  So the class that had English instruction in the morning one week 
will receive English instruction in the afternoon the next week.  This ensures a 50/50 split in language 
instruction.  Literacy instruction is simultaneous in both languages.  Students are learning phonics, reading, writing, 
science, and social studies.  ELL students are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell running records and Estrellita.   The 
level of Spanish language proficiency  for the EP students is emerging.  Students are developing oral language.  The 
Dual Language program for 1st and 2nd grade uses a self-contained model because there is only one class per 
grade.  The program in these grades maintain a 50/50 model.  Students receive English instruction in the morning and 
Spanish instruction in the afternoon.  These switch weekly so students have the opportunity to receive instruction in 
both languages in the morning and afternoon on a weekly rotating basis. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Paste response to questions here: Ell programming is very strategic to ensure that students receive the minimum 
minutes of ENL support required by Part 154.  Students needing the most instructional minutes are programmed first with a 
combination of Stand-alone and integrated services.  Students are grouped by language proficiency and/or grade level.  On the 
ENL teacher’s schedule, it reflects the number of minutes for students so time can be tracked easily.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Paste response here:  All the ELLs in the freestanding ENL program receive content area instruction in English using ENL 
methodology. In content areas, the students use a hands on approach and are supported through leveled materials, 
technology, multimedia and audio sensory materials. 
A variety of learning strategies are applied to differentiate instruction for ELL subgroups.  The approaches include multiple 
intelligences, Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA) for the upper grades, cooperative learning, role 
playing, process writing, buddy reading and writing.  Both ENL and Academic Intervention Services are provided to all 
ELLs.  New programs and improvements that are being considered for this year include: Additional test prep material for 
NYSESLAT and other New York State Assessments and monthly professional development sessions with teachers on strategies 
to support ELLs .  Our ELLs participate in the same activities as other students:  Multicultural activities, academic programs and 
enrichment programs during and after school, and  have opportunities to go on all trips and participate in monthly cultural 
presentations.   
When pushing-in, the ENL teacher applies a variety of learning strategies to help ELLs comprehend the content of the 
lesson.  The content is modified to help foster language development, promote understanding and the application of skills 
learned to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. 
To further support the students, we utilize a hands-on approach in math and science.  The classroom and ENL teacher apply 
ENL methodology and appropriate strategies to enhance second language acquisition. A variety of scaffolding strategies are 
used to help students comprehend content and boost their understanding of academic language.  In the freestanding ENL, 
core content materials used are Language Power which is a literacy program that is science and social studies based.  In the DL 
program the language for core content instruction is both English and Spanish.  Materials in both languages are used to teach 
core content.   For native language support we provide bilingual dictionaries, glossaries and other instructional materials.  All 
curriculum materials used are aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards. The native language materials support 
students with accessing the content and the curriculum. This year all classrooms have technology that can be used to enhance 
the learning experience for students. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Paste response to question here:  In DL students  are assessed in both languages throughout the year to measure their 
Spanish language acquisition.  Assessment in both languages is embedded in the program.  In the ENL program students are 
offered the choice to take content area exams in their home language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:   
a.  Almost all SIFE Ells at PS 18 are new immigrants.  These students are pulled out in small groups to the ENL classroom  to 
provide basic language skills in the beginning of the school year.  Bilingual glossaries are used to help them understand 
academic language in content areas, especially math and science.  Other materials used include:  books and language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

development materials explaining step by step process for understanding problems both in English and home language, 
bilingual picture dictionaries, flash cards, hands on manipulatives such as; finger puppets for oral language practice.  Web 
based programs like Raz-Kids, is also used to support these students with learning basic elements of english (alphabet 
recognition, sounds, blending and decoding). 
b. All the ELLs in kindergarten to second grade at PS 18 are newcomers.  We also have a number of students in grades 3 
through 5 who fall in this category. These students need a lot of help in understanding basic English and conventions of the 
language.  The language development material used for them is grade and age appropriate.  During the beginning part of the 
school year the ENL teacher pushes into classes to help them get early childhood students acclimated to school rules and 
culture of school and learning.  The ENL teacher carries with him the material to the classroom that will help them better 
understand what they are learning.  As the year progresses, these ELLs are pulled out to receive small group 
instruction.  Language Power instructional materials are used to help these students reinforce what they have learned in 
various content areas such as science and math.  The program has unit assessments that are aligned with  all four modalities of 
language i.e. listening, speaking, reading and writing. 
The ENL teacher pushes in during content area and ELA periods in upper grades to support newcomers with understanding 
academic language in the context of the topic being taught.  Those who need additional help are pulled out for small group 
instruction to reinforce what was taught in the class and also for application of new vocabulary words and syntax that they are 
required to know at their grade level. 
During small group instruction manipulatives are used for hands on activities to help students acquire the language and the 
content.  Thinking Maps is an additional tool used to support newcomers with brainstorming ideas and representing their 
thinking.  Visuals can be used with the Maps to communicate their ideas as well. 
c. We have a few ELLs who have been receiving ENL services for over four years.  Various scaffolding strategies such as 
sentence starters, prompts, verbalizing responses before writing and small group work are used to assist them in acquiring 
language and learning content.  The Language Power Curriculum is also used to support language acquisition and learning 
content.  Thinking Maps are used to help the ELLS acquire  vocabulary and they serve as a visual scaffold for supporting 
comprehension. 
d.We do not have any ELLs in this category so far this school year.  Over the years, we have used intensive small group 
instructional delivery model to provide service to these ELLs.  These students benefit from specific skills development such as 
writing mechanics, revising and editing their drafts, understanding questions and problems in math and science through step-
by-step process.  The focus of the lessons for these ELLs is on reading comprehension, writing and group discussions to further 
develop oral language. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:  About twenty-three percent of our ELLs are SWDs.  They need additional help in 
understanding key concepts and basic conventions of language.  Manipulatives and materials such as flash cards, word games 
and visuals are used for language development.   Native language materials such as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are 
also used to support language development.  The curricula used in both Math and ELA (Go Math K-5, Core Knowledge K-2 and 
Expeditionary Learning 3-5) provide scaffolds for ELLs and recommendations for RTI instruction to support learning of content 
and provide access to information.  Paraprofessionals provide one to one support and students benefit from working in small 
groups with their peers.  The ENL teacher pushes in to support learning in small groups.  Students in grades K-5 also receive 
intervention using the Fountas and Pinnell Intervention System.  Every classroom has at least 2 computers students can use to 
access programs that support reading and math.  In the primary grades (K-2) teachers also have I-pads and in grades 3-
5 teachers have STEM carts with laptops for individual students to use.  This ensures that teachers have the resources to 
differentiate instruction to meet the needs of the students.  The IEP teacher ensures that all students with IEPs receive their 
mandated services.  If the mandated service is ENL, the IEP teacher coordinates with the ENL teacher to ensure that the 
services are being provided.  This is reflected in the ENL teacher’s schedule.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Paste response to question here:  ELL-SWDs are in heterogeneous classrooms and heterogeneous groups for pull out to the 
ENL class.  This ensures that they have opportunities to work with their peers in the least restrictive environment.  The special 
education teacher and the ENL teacher work with students in small group to provide support with IEP goals as well as provide 
scaffolds for students to learn the content.  Curricula are modified based on data and students’ goals to ensure the language 
needs of students are met.  When needed, students have modified schedules where they receive breaks as prescribed by their 
IEP to accommodate their attention span.  Teachers plan with students’ IEP goals in mind to provide modifications and 
accommodations to support learning in the least restrictive environment. Teachers have supported students in articulating 
their goals for each content area.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here:  Intervention for all ELLs in all subjects involve small group instruction and technology where 
teachers and paraprofessionals use scaffolds and strategies to help students learn content and acquire language where the 
language spoken is English.  Entering/Emerging students also benefit from being pulled out to the ENL classroom for 
reinforcement in content area instruction and language development.  ELLs also receive intervention during ENL 
afterschool  program and our Friday Enrichment program that provides support with vocabulary acquisition test taking 
strategies.  All subgroups are invited to attend these programs however the materials used may differ.  For example, 
entering/emerging ELLs will benefit from materials specifically designed to build language skills in all modalities and learn 
content.  ELLs in other subgroups may be engaged with materials used by all students with specific scaffolds to support them.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here:  For the upcoming school year (2017-2018) we will be improving our support for ELLs by 
implementing Thinking Maps, Expeditionary Learning in grade 3-5, introducing guided reading small group work in grades K-5, 
web based intervention programs (Raz-Kids) and an afterschool enrichment program specifically designed to support ELLs with 
Listening and Speaking.  There will also be a Friday program designed to support reading and writing. This afterschool program 
will incorporate Art.  ELL programs and instruction will have a measurable outcomes.  These improvements were considered 
because they give students a chance to get exposure to the arts and learn about culture. In addition they get to express what 
they have learned by writing an essay. this allows the teachers to assess students writing. By analyzing their students writing 
teachers will be able to support students in this area and prepare them in grades 3-5  for the NYSELAT examanation. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:   At this time the Lexia program has been discontinued due to budgetary 
constraints.  However, the programs in place are researched based and have been successful based on the gains of last year's 
NYSESLAT scores. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here:  All ELLs have equal access to all curricular and extracurricular programs.  ELLs are invitied to 
participate and encouraged to perform at academic levels and enrichment activities during and after school.  All students, 
including ELLs overwhelmingly sign up for a wide variety of activities where they get opportunities to learn, share and acquire 
new skills, explore their talents and hone their skills in various areas.  ENL students join all the educational trips and are among 
active members in various activities such as St. Nick's Allisance program, Hip Hop Yoga  and the instrumental music instruction 
program at PS 18.  
Some of the programs are especially designed to meet the needs of ELLs and former ELLs.  This program is specifically designed 
to provide ELL students with language acquisition skills utilizing ELA skills through art.   Toward the end of the year, students 
present their art work to parents and families during a culminating celebration.  The Friday program designed to provide AIS 
services and test prep is also available to ELLs.  Teachers use small group instruction with scaffolds and strategies to build 
vocabulary to support reading comprehension, writing and test taking strategies for ELL. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

Paste response to question here:  Instructional materials and technology used to support ELLs include: computer aided 
instruction in math (Go Math videos), Fundations (phonics), visual and reading aids on the computer and ipad, Raz-Kids 
Interactive books and all curriculum has suggested scaffolds and entry points to support ELLs witht he cotnent.  This year we 
are incorporating something new called Moby Max and Core Clicks.  Moby Max provides an assessment and provides activities 
at the students' level and builds on what the students knows.   Core Clicks is an interactive reading program that builds 
comprehension.  All classrooms have SmartBoards to support ELLs and all of the common core curriculum components have 
interactive activities to support skills and content mastery.  Grades K-1 have I-pad, grades 2-3 have laptop carts and grades K-5 
have at least four computers in the classroom as an additional support.  This coming year we will have a new computer lab and 
students in grades 3-5 have mobile STEM labs to support students in Math, Science and Technology.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here:   ELLs who are literate in their native language are allowed to take the standardized tests in 
math and science.  In our Spanish Dual Language program, students are assessed using Estreillita, a Spanish phonics/reading 
assessment.  In our ENL program, students are assessed using Raz-Kids.  Students can access leveled texts in their home 
language.  Comprehension and reading level can be tested using Raz-Kids.  Also, ELLs and former ELLs are allowed access to 
approved bilingual dictionaries during the state standardized tests.   
Our Spanish dual language program continues to support our Spanish native language speakers while providing non-Spanish 
speaking students with instruction in their new language. Our German speaking children are receiving enrichment in their 
home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Paste response to question here:    
The ENL schedule including Stand-alone and integrated services are so designed to provide maximum possible support to 
students at their corresponding age and grade levels.  The integrated portion of our program are grade and age specific 
because students are in their room with their peers.  So 4 of the 7.5 times per week, the services directly correspond to the 
ELLs' ages and grade levels.  During stand-alone, the groups may be one  grade level up or down because it is primarily based 
on language acquisition.  However, during those times, the ENL teacher differentiates the sessions so the supports are still age 
and grade specific. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here:  P.S. 18 is not a co-located site.  We are the only school in the building so all resources are 
used to meet the needs of the students. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here: At. P.S. 18 we make every effort to make ELL students who enroll before the school year feel 
part of the community.   All notices and welcome signs are written in English and Spanish.  During registration, we introduce 
ourselves to the students and the parent coordinator or other staff members are always available to translate.  This helps put 
the students and parents at ease and they feel welcome.  Once an ELL is enrolled, the parent coordinator provides the 
students and the parent a tour of the building so students become familiar with the physical layout of the school.  All 
important information needed for a successful start of the school year are communicated in the home language so families 
feel prepared.  This makes parents and students feel comfortable with the transition.  Before the first day of school we prepare 
classrooms and the ENL area by labeling objects and posting rules and routines in the home language.  Due to the high 
population of ELLs, the principal ensures that all teachers receive ongoing professional development in strategies to support 
ELLs. and make them feel welcome.  Ells enrolled after the start of the school year are introduced to survival English essential 
for their day-to-day activities using TPR and similar easy-to-follow activities by the ENL teacher.  The parent coordinator 
introduces herself to the parents, takes them on a tour of the building and introduces them to their child's teacher and other 
key staff. Mrs. Gaffner, guidance counselor, is always available to speak parents and students.

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Paste response to question here: This year we will be starting a German Language enrichment program.  All students will be 
given the opportunity to participate in the program.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here: At PS 18 the Kindergarten Dual Language program is a side by side 
model.  We strive to achieve a 50/50 ratio between EP and ELLs.  There are two kindergarten classes and 
there are EP and ELLs in both classes.  In the morning, one class receives English instruction while the 
other class receives Spanish instruction (Periods 1-3).  Period 4 students go to lunch.  After lunch the 
classes switch and receive instruction in the other language (periods 5, 6 and 7).  The class that received 
English instruction in the morning will receive Spanish instruction in the afternoon.  The class that 
received Spanish instruction in the morning will receive English instruction in the afternoon.  This 
structure changes weekly.  So the class that had English instruction in the morning one week will receive 
English instruction in the afternoon the next week.  This ensures a 50/50 split in language 
instruction.  Literacy instruction is simultaneous in both languages.  Students are learning phonics, 
reading, writing, science, and social studies.  Both classes receive daily preparation periods in Physical 
Education, Visual Arts and Drama/Vocal music.  ELL students are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell 
running records and Estreillita.   The level of Spanish language proficiency  for the EP students is 
emerging.  Students are developing oral language.  The Dual Language program in 1st and 2nd grade uses 
a self-contained model because there is one class per grade.  The students receive English instruction in 
the morning and Spanish in the afternoon and this schedule rotates each week. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:   All ELL personnel at PS 18 participate in monthly professional development lead by the ENL 
teacher.  The sessions are specific to planning units around content and language acquisition to support ELLs.  This professional 
development is in addition to the professional development provided by the principal and outside consultants  
Paste response to question here:  The principal provides professional development for all teachers not just the ENL and Dual 
Language teachers in the use of scaffolds and strategies to engage students with the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  Strategies to support building vocabulary, improving reading comprehension and writing are included.  Thinking 
Maps continue to be one of the tools being implemented school-wide to support student engagement.  
September: Reading and writing workshop presented by Mr. Lemos Assistant Principal 
October: Scaffolds presented by Mrs. Tramparulo ENL teacher 
November: Flexible Grouping by Ms. Peralta and Ms. Shaikh Dual Languge/ICT teachers

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Paste response to question here: The ENL and Dual Language teachers attend professional development through the office of 
DELLS and Brooklyn North Field Support Center.  The ENL teacher, who also acts as the ELL liaison for the school, turn keys the 
highlights the salient points from the PDs to the staff.  In addition, the principal regularly plans in-house professional 
development on supporting ELLs.  Resources to assist teachers with planning scaffolds for ELLs are shared with staff.  Thinking 
Maps training includes conversation around how the maps can specifically be used to support ELLs with learning content and 
language.  Teachers are not only getting professional development  throughout the year on supporting ELLs, in service days like 
Election Day are devoted to providing additional training on strategies to support ELLs with opportunities to use the strategies 
learned to plan instruction.  The professional development sessions turn-keyed by the ENL teacher, the sessions provided by 
the principal (throughout the year and on in-service training days) and support from outside consultants ensures that the 
requirements of CR Part 154.2 are being met for all staff and ENL/bilingual teachers.  Agendas  and sign-in sheets are kept on 
file to document the amount of professional development that is provided to support learning for ELLs.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:  Annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs are planned for: mid-October 2017 and mid-
March 2018. The focus of October 2017 meetings will be an introduction to the changes in CR Part 154 and the way they affect 
the program for ELLs.  The mid-March 2018 meetings will provide information about the shifts in testing for ELLs, how to 
provide continued support to students at home and what is expected of ELLs in terms of passing the grade and improving their 
performance on NYS tests including ELA, math, science and the revised NYSESLAT. The topics discussed and shared with 
parents at such meetings include: language development progress of the child, language assessment results, and content area 
(academic vocabulary) language development needs.  On site interpretation and translation help is available by the parent 
coordinator and other staff to ensure that parents have an opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification.  Parents’ 
questions and concerns are addressed in their home language. The ENL teacher and the parent coordinator keep sign in sheets 
of all in-person meetings.  Every effort is made to reach out to all parents of ELLs.  Those who are unable to attend scheduled 
meetings, are contacted by phone and if needed, by letter.  Special 1-on-1 meetings are held during preparation periods and 
sessions before and after school to accommodate parents.  
Agendas and sign in sheets of the meetings will be kept in the ENL binder 
Tuesday Parent Involvement time will be used to set up meetings with families of ELL students to discuss progress and areas of 
need 
Parent Coordinator will conduct outreach activities geared to provide families of ELL students to provide them with resources 
to assist them with their transition to a new country 
Parent Coordinator will hold meetings specifically designed for parents of ELL students 
Classroom teachers will maintain communication with families of ELL students via class DoJo (web-based program designed to 
provide parents and students up-to-date information on student achievement, attendance, and any other school related 
issues) 
  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

Paste response here:  The ENL teacher and the parent coordinator jointly hold a number of meetings with parents of newly 
admitted ELLs to describe services, distribute the program preference surveys and introduce themselves to the parents, with 
whom they maintain frequent contact.  Parents of ELLs are often asked to share their culture by participating in our Hispanic 
Heritage Month celebration and our cultural dance festival. We have also held several activities that included ELLs from our 
school: 
The Cinco De Mayo Cultural Celebration/Workshop topic: cultural heritage 
The Dominican Day Celebration/Workshop topic : Culture contributions of Hispanics 
Our Multi cultural Day/Workshop topic: An in-depth study of a particular country 
A visit to EL Respertorio Espanol/Workshop Topic: What Role Does The Arts Play In Our Everyday Life 
End of School year celebration BBQ/Workshop Topic; Food and Culture Around The World 
After school end of year writing celebration/Workshop Topic: How Does Our Culture Impact Our Lives 
  
During Parent-Teacher conferences, the ENL teacher invites parents of ELLs to meet with them as well as classroom teachers to 
discuss ways for language development for newcomers and how to help ELLs acquire academic language in content areas.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alison Alexander, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use various documents/resources including Home Language Survey, ATS reports such as RAPL, ELPC to assess 
the language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication.  

We use this information to download, draft and customize letters being sent home in the native language/s of the 
parents such as continued entitlement letters for ELLs and entitlement letters, parent program choice, surveys, 
etc.  

Data used for school wide language needs include: ATS reports: UPPG, RHLA, RAPL,  

Individual Parent’s responses on Emergency contact card about preferred language of communication for oral and 
written language.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

Methodologies used to assess language preferences include, but not limited to: All parents/guardians of new 
admits are asked to fill in NYC DOE parents’ Preferred Language Form that collects the language preference of 
parents for school communications. P.S. 18 annually conducts classroom surveys to find out whether families 
prefer to receive school memos and letters in English or Spanish. Over the years, about 45 to 50 percent of 
parents have preferred Spanish as the language of communication.  

Parent surveys - to assess the needs of parents and how can they help their children do better in school- are made 
available in English and Spanish to allow all parents to participate in school wide needs assessment during open 
school nights and various meetings/workshops we host for parents.  

We regularly update the languages that parents speak across the grades to make sure all written communication 
sent home is sent in home language of each student. Also, for oral communication to parents, we use the home 
langauge of parents.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

As of October 2015, of the 
current 35 ELLs 32 of them 
indicate Spanish as their 
home language. Of the 
total 8 new ELLs, five (5) 
indicate Spanish as their 
home language, while 
three (3) indicate Arabic as 
their native language.  

The ENL teacher enters 
home language as per HLIS 
and checks this data to 
ensure its accuracy in order 
to complete ELPC screen on 
ATS to comply with 
Chancellor’s regulations 
per Part 154 requirement.  

Of the total 191 students 
enrolled at PS 18 K as of 
October 2015, about 54 per 
cent of the parents have 
indicated English as their 
preferred langauge for oral 
and written 
communication. About 46 
percent of the parents have 
indicated Spanish as their 
preferred langauge for oral 
and written

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to provide 

interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

Tentative dates for the formal face-
to-face meetings with parents at PS 
18 for curriculum nights, parent-
teacher conferences, are as follows:  

Open school nights (curriculum 
nights): mid-September (9/17/15) 
and mid-May (5/12/16)  

Parent-teacher conferences: 
afternoon and evening the first 
weeks of November 2015 and March 
2016.  

Annual individual meetings with 
parents of ELLs are planned for: 
December 2015 and March 2016.  

The focus of the December 2015 
meetings will be an introduction to 
the changes in CR Part 154 and the 
way they affect the programs for 
ELLs.  

The March 2015 meetings will 
provide information about the shifts 
in testing for ELLs, how to provide 
continued support to students at 
home and what is expected of ELLs in 
terms of passing the grade and 
improving their performance in NYS 
tests including ELA, math, science and 
revised NYSESLAT.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 
 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 establishes the procedures for ensuring that Limited English Speaking parents are 
provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their 
child’s education.  

At PS 18 we have posted, in conspicuous locations at or near the primary entrance to the school, a sign in each of the 
covered languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services. We 
have enough resources in house, to provide language translation and interpretation orally and in written form for 
fulfilling Chancellor’s requirement under A-663 regarding parental notification and interpretation services.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We revised our parent survey to reflect the launching of the Spanish dual language program for kindergarteners in 
September 2015. The revised survey is distributed to parents during meetings such as open school nights, parent 
teacher conferences, individual meeting with parents of ELLs, family fun nights and parent association sessions.  

We plan to form a focus group of parents representing all cultures and languages of our students to invite feedback 
from parents, to facilitate better communication for the school community and also to strengthen home-school 
connection.  

A team headed by the principal will review the feedback from the parents periodically. The team will consist of the 
principal, the parent coordinator, the ENL teacher (who is also the LAC) and the dual language teacher. Suggestions 
from the school leadership team and parent teacher association, that may improve the quality of translation and 
interpretations services to the parents, will be considered.
