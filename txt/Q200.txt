Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The school community of PS/MS 200, The Magnet School of Global Studies & Leadership, abides by our motto: 200 
cares. The five letters in "cares" stand for culture, access, rigor, excellence, and safety. We study and celebrate 
cultures from around the world. Children are given access to rigorous learning experiences and diverse extra-
curricular activities and athletics so that they are prepared for high school, college, and careers. Together we strive for 
excellence and we cultivate a safe and positive school environment. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As of July 1, 2018, PS/MS 200 has been officially renamed The Magnet School of Global Studies & Leadership. We 
foster a spirit of global citizenship in our students and we create meaningful learning experiences that expose 
students to problems that face our local, national, and global community. Our diverse student population is 
comprised of a wide array of world cultures and our young students explore these cultures in depth. Older students 
use this cultural knowledge to explore how they can become leaders in the 21st century. Our curriculum is 
characterized by Project-Based Learning experiences and STEM education is infused from Pre-K through 8th grade. 
We have partnered with the Buck Institute for Education and Columbia University Teachers College to support these 
curricular efforts and we continue to collaborate with three partner schools in District 25 as part of the Department of 
Education's Learning Partners Program. Next year will be our first implementation year of The Leader in Me, which is 
a framework rooted in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. These habits align to the five core competencies of 
Social and Emotional Learning. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

61% of our students qualify for free lunch. Currently, 16% of our students have IEPs and 5% are English Language 
Learners. Student ethnicity percentages: 49% Hispanic, 20% Black, 14% Asian, 15% White, 1% Multi-Racial, and 1% 
American Indian or Alaskan Native. Recently, students in the testing grades (3-8) have demonstrated greater progress 
and performance in English Language Arts than in Mathematics. Between 2017 and 2018, students in grades 3-8 
achieved 5% growth in ELA proficiency, according to state exam results, but decreased by 1% in Math proficiency.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year, our school has made the most progress in the elements of rigorous instruction, collaborative 
teachers, and strong family-community ties. Through our professional learning plan, our collaborative enhancement 
of the curriculum through Project-Based Learning, and our efforts to improve communication with parents and 
families, we have continued to improve as a school community. This year, we will maintain our instructional focus on 
the impact of formative assessment strategies. Students will set targeted learning goals and monitor their progress. 
Teachers will give frequent feedback to students about their strengths and areas for growth, and they will guide 
students' next steps. School leaders will provide resources and cultivate professional learning opportunities to 
support teachers in this work. This instructional focus supports the Framework for Great Schools elements of Rigorous 
Instruction and Collaborative Teachers most of all. Additionally, we will focus heavily on the Framework element of 
Supportive Environment. Teacher and parent feedback about our learning environment is generally positive, but 
middle school student feedback is less positive.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

 

  We received a Proficient rating for Quality Indicator 1.2 (Instruction) in our last Quality Review . The reviewer 
noted multiple rigorous instructional practices in classrooms she visited, but indicated that there was a need 
for more consistency across classrooms and more enrichment for higher-performing students. The principal 
received similar feedback during PPO visits in 2017-2018. Using assessment in instruction is a core element of 
Quality Indicator 1.2. 

  Teachers collaborate frequently with colleagues to plan lessons and units and to analyze student work. Our 

inquiry protocol calls on teachers to tie their analysis to their own instructional practices so that they are 
continually striving to improve. This year's inquiry work will be connected directly to assessment practices. 

  Teacher teams have a system for collaboratively reviewing units of study in order to provide feedback about 

the rigor of learning activities, assessments, and instructional shifts.  

  Our teachers have historically received lower overall ratings in Danielson Component 3d (Using Assessment in 

 

Instruction) than in other Danielson Components. 
June Instructional Reports and item analyses indicate uneven student progress and performance in ELA and 
Math across grades 3-8. Greater alignment of instructional practices and curriculum is still a need on some 
grade levels. Effective formative assessment practices have a direct impact on academic progress. 

  According to 2018 state exams, 17% of students with disabilities were proficient in ELA and 6% in Math. 
  36% of English Language Learners were proficient in Math and 15% of English Language Learners were 

proficient in ELA, according to 2018 state exam results. 

  During the 2017-2018 school year, teachers engaged in professional learning cycle about the Exemplars 

problem solving approach and method for assessing. Teachers practiced designing and delivering lessons 
rooted in a single problem solving task. In 2018-2019, we are expanding this effort to make problem solving a 
regular element of Math instruction. 
In Spring 2018, the Curriculum Team reviewed Mathematics units of study from different grade levels and 
revised units to include additional, aligned problem solving tasks. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, at least 80% of Math teachers will have enhanced their instructional practices, according to the National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics' eight Mathematics Teaching Practices, through cycles of professional learning and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

inquiry, thus enabling students to deepen their conceptual understanding and problem solving skills, and resulting in 
two or more Effective or Highly Effective ratings in Danielson Component 3c: Engaging Students in Learning.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The principal and assistant principal will observe all teachers 
quarterly and they will provide thorough feedback and next 
steps tied specifically to the NCTM Mathematics Practices. They 
will also conduct periodic instructional walk-throughs in order to 
analyze the impact of teacher support and feedback given to 
students with disabilities and English Language Learners. 

Teachers in need of support related to rigorous instruction in 
mathematics will visit the classrooms of teachers who 
consistently demonstrate Highly Effective formative assessment 
practices. Magnet Resource Specialists will focus most on 
supporting Math instruction in grades 3-7 due to their recent 
lack of growth in student proficiency. 

Teachers will engage in cycles of professional learning tied to 
formative assessment strategies in Math and effective feedback 
to students during problem solving-based lessons. Teacher teams 
will conduct action research related to formative assessment and 
they will engage in collaborative inquiry at least twice per month 
to support their assessment of student learning using the 
Exemplars Rubric for Problem Solving.  

Teacher teams will conduct portfolio reviews each quarter in 
order to assess the quality and pacing of student's engagement 
with high-level Math tasks. They will set next steps to achieve for 
the portfolio review to follow. 

Teacher teams will periodically evaluate their units of study for 
rigor using an adapted version of the EQuIP Rubric. Specifically, 
they will analyze units to determine the instructional supports in 
effect for students with disabilities and English Language 
Learners. Additionally, teams will analyze benchmark assessment 
data at least three times during the school year. 

The school has partnered with Bank Street College to support 
mathematics instruction in grades K-2 and with Algebra for All to 
support students in grades 5-8.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

  Our school is small enough to allow for teachers and staff to get to know individual children well. Most 

students spend nine or ten years at our school, as it spans PK-Grade 8.  

  We received a Well Developed rating in Quality Indicator 3.4, High Expectations, on our last Quality Review 

report.  

  The Framework for Great Schools Report indicates that we need the most improvement in this element.  
  The percentage of positive student responses has room for improvement in the areas of: safety, classroom 
behavior, peer support for academic work, personal attention and support, academic press, and guidance. 
Parent and Teacher responses are more positive than student responses.  
In response to our needs related to Supportive Environment, our school will begin its first full year of 
implementation of The Leader in Me during the 2018-19 school year. All staff were trained in The 7 Habits of 
Highly Effective People in May and June 2018 and professional learning related to The Leader in Me will 
continue throughout the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, staff and students will have observed the impact of the school community's practice of The 7 Habits of 
Highly Effective People, the central tenets of the Leader in Me framework, and how the practice of these habits has 
improved school culture and safety, resulting in both a 10% increase in positive student responses in the Supportive 
Environment section of the NYC School Survey and a 10% decrease in the number of level 3, 4, and 5 infractions 
reported in OORS.

All staff will participate in two trainings, Launching Leadership 
and Creating Culture, as a follow-up to the 7 Habits training that 
they received in Spring 2018. These trainings will launch The 
Leader in Me in the 2018-19 school year. 

We will tie our school's PBIS systems, including Spots and Cougar 
Bucks, to The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. These systems 
reward attendance, punctuality, behavior, and effort in class.  

Students in grades 6-8 will pursue two Enrichment Electives this 
year. Topics will include: community service, yoga, chess, film 
study, improvisation, and more. Students will have an 
opportunity to lead school initiatives through Enrichment 
Electives as well. Middle school students will also have the 
opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities like student 
government, CHAMPS, and the Central Queens Y after-school 
program. 

We will launch The Leader in Me with an opening assembly and 
other school events. Each month, from December through June, 
we will focus on one of the 7 Habits. These 7 Habits will serve as 
the character trait we celebrate each month for Student of the 
Month.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all Math teachers will have engaged in multiple cycles of collaborative inquiry with fellow grade team 
members and vertical teams in order to target the needs of specific subgroups, plan for effective interventions, and 
assess the impact of these interventions, resulting in a 10% increase in student proficiency, according to the 2019 NYS 
Math Exams in Grades 3-8.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
  On our last Quality Review Report, we received Well Developed ratings in the areas of curriculum, high 

expectations, and teacher teams. We received Proficient ratings in the areas of instruction and assessment. 
  We received an overall score of 4.14 for the Effective School Leadership portion of the 2017 Framework for 

Great Schools Report.  

  We received an overall score of 3.48 in the Trust portion of the 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report.  
  There is a need for more refined assessment structures at the whole-school and classroom level, according to 

the principal's PPO and the Quality Review. This work will begin with school leaders. 

  PPO feedback indicated a need for greater alignment between the Instructional Focus, Professional Learning 

Plan, and core school initiatives related to curriculum, assessment, and instruction.  

  Recent survey feedback indicates that just over 80% of teachers feel that school leaders trust their expertise, 

so there is an opportunity to create more opportunities for teachers to lead.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will have facilitated the writing, refinement, and implementation of two rigorous, 
transdisciplinary units of study at each grade level, rooted in the Project-Based Learning methodology, and which 
challenge all students to apply literacy skills, research skills, and STEM methods to real problems facing the local, 
national or global community, as evidenced by two corresponding Exemplar ratings, according to the EQuIP Rubric for 
Lessons and Units.

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

this 
number 
can 
change 
during the 
school 
year, we 
usually 
have 
between 
15 and 20 
Students 
in 
Temporary 
Housing. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

During 2018-2019 school year, we will provide academic intervention services to those students in need of additional 
support. Also, we will provide at-risk services to those in need. Our Parent Coordinator will maintain contact with the 
families of Students in Temporary Housing so that we can determine other needs that the school might be able to 
support. Pending funding availability, we will invite Students in Temporary Housing to participate in Saturday Test 
Prep enrichment as well.

intervention services, etc.). 
Most of our Pre-K students remain at our school for Kindergarten. Therefore, the majority of the preschool children 
are accustomed to the school building. Our Pre-K and Kindergarten teacher teams work together throughout the 
school year to ensure continuity in curriculum and alignment in respective Magnet sub-themes. In the spring, 
preschool students' parents will be invited to meet Kindergarten teachers and learn about the next year's curriculum 
and expectations. In the spring, Pre-K and Kindergarten parents are also invited to a yearly "Man in My Life" Father's 
Day celebration. Pre-K and Kindergarten teams share student records in June and the School-Based Support Team 
conducts Turning 5 evaluations in preparation for the transition from preschool to elementary school. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The MOSL Committee, Professional Learning Committee, and Curriculum Team collaborate with the principal and 
assistant principal to determine appropriate assessment measures at each grade level and the accompanying 
professional development that supports these measures. The Professional Learning Calendar includes benchmarks for 
teacher teams to have time to review assessment results and create action plans. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/MS 200Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/MS 200 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  providing materials and training, in workshops and other gatherings, to help parents work with their children 

to improve their achievement level in literacy, math, and the use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding city, state and federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent-related programs, meetings, and other activities (on the school 
website, in fliers, and at PTA meetings) in a format and in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parent input in order 

to improve outreach, communication skills, and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

Part III: Assessment Analysis 
 
 

0 

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Fountas and Pinnell is used to determine a child's reading level. This reading assessment enables teachers to differentiate their 
instruction for the ELL population in their classes by informing the teacher about the child's ability to respond to text in various 
ways. This information will not only inform teachers of a child's ability to decode text, but also to comprehend the text. In 
addition to Fountas and Pinnell, the classroom teachers use formative, interim, summative and pre- & post- assessments at 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

 

various points through the year to measure strengths, weaknesses and growth, and to ensure that ELLs are approaching grade 
level proficiency. 
 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Time is set aside for the administration of Fountas & Pinnell assessments. Teachers use F&P data to group students by reading 
level. Teachers evaluate student learning through the use of assessments such as: pre- & post-, interim, summative and 
formative assessment to assess students’ strengths, weaknesses, and growth and to determine whether a particular lesson, 
topic or concept needs to be reviewed or has been mastered.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Data from assessments such as NYS Regents, NYSESLAT, and NYS ELA, Math, and Science exams reveal that our ELLs are 
moving toward higher levels of achievement. According to the NYC Dept. of Ed. School report, all beginners scored one or two 
levels higher than last year. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

This section will be completed once assessment data is received. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Classroom teachers address Response to Intervention throughout their day and ELL students are grouped according to their 
needs. In addition, designated teachers of each grade have been identified to provide RTI for targeted Tier 2 and 3 students. 
Students are identified for RTI based on data from formative assessments, summative assessments, conference notes, teacher 
observation and running records.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data reveals that our ELLs are stronger in their Listening and Speaking skills than they are in Reading 
and Writing.  While reviewing the data of students who scored "Entering", "Emerging" or "Transitioning" level of English 
proficiency, we noted a common deficiency in these students’ ability to decode, determine meaning of vocabulary terms, as 
well as an overall thorough comprehension of read texts.  However, students who scored at the "Expanding" level of 
proficiency were noted to have a stronger ability to decode words, syntax, and a narrower deficiency in both comprehension 
and in Writing. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

These findings not only be addressed by the ENL teachers, they will also be disseminated to the classroom teachers.  This will 
enable those teachers to work collaboratively in addressing the strengths and weaknesses of each student while allowing 
teachers to utilize this information to guide their planning and focus of study and support students’ continual learning and 
growth.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The freestanding ENL program at PS/MS 200 is traditional in that all instruction is provided in English. The ENL teacher 
and the classroom teachers meet regularly to collaborate to determine how to best meet the educational needs of 
the students for the heterogeneous Push-In and mixed proficiency levels and grades for the Pull-Out Models.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All NYSITELL scores are reviewed by the ENL team to determine the appropriate amount of instructional minutes that each 
child is mandated to receive. Once that has been determined, the ENL teachers works with the child's classroom teacher to 
determine the best time for the student to receive push in/pull out services. Students that are entering and emerging receive 
360 minutes per week (1/2 pull out and 1/2 push in). Students who are transitioning or expanding receive 180 minutes per 
week of push in services. Students who are considered commanding receive 90 minutes per week of push in service. All push 
in and pull out services are provided by teachers who holds both TESOL and childhood education certifications.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
There are two full time ENL teacher servicing four classes in the regular school day /29 periods per week.  All classes are 
conducted in English only.  The ENL teacher utilizes the classroom teachers' unit to ensure cohesion of studies.  She also 
ensures the use of various genres of books which relate to the content area subjects across the grades.  The school has 
implemented Ready Gen reading program in K-5 and Expeditionary Learning in grades 6-8, Go Math, computer software, e-
books and English Explores social studies/science leveled books.  These instructional resources address the learning needs of 
all students. The units are embedded with scaffolded instructional support that addresses the needs of targeted groups 
and ELLs. Our leveled reading program teaches English through the content areas.  Teachers also promote rich 
discussions/Team Talk during instructional time in order to deepen students' comprehension skills. The ENL teacher also uses 
various methods in order to make content comprehensible and foster language development, such as: modeling, 
differentiated instruction, scaffolds, visuals, TPR, realia, graphic organizers, vocabulary list and definition which are explicitly 
taught and etc. The programs also incorporate reading, speaking, writing and listening skills in a stimulating way, while also 
being aligned with the New York State Learning Standards. In addition, drama presentation will be utilized. This will help 
students to recall information, relate to characters in a realistic fiction, and aid in the development of meaningful academic 
discourse.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We don't have native language classes for ELLs, but they do take the State Native Examinations to exceed State and City 
Standards.  Native language support is delivered through dictionaries, oral and written translations. Also, native language 
books are available in school library and ENL classroom.   
     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d.

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
Our plan for meeting SIFE students’ needs is to offer more opportunities in speaking, listening, reading and writing, in order 
to target areas of weaknesses in literacy. Based on data, the student uses graphic organizers to break stories down into 
more comprehensible bits of information.  Students are also taught how to take organized notes and to focus on the central 
idea when reading and writing. We have ongoing dialogue to inform the parents, on how students are performing in school 
and at home.  Classroom teachers help with differentiation of their instruction and use “juicy” sentences to deconstruct and 
reconstruct the meaning of the sentences. 
 
Our SIFE students receive extended instructional time in our after-school Title III program.  However, at the present time our 
school does not have any SIFE students in our ENL program. For newcomers and the students who have been in school for less 
than three years, we use picture words, stress vocabulary acquisition, teach phonics, and simple sentences.  We also 
use Starfall.com, abcya.com, realia, Lexia Reading and a multi-sensory program for English language development.  The multi-
sensory program, which focuses on reading in the content areas (social studies and science), is a series of books designed to 
develop English language proficiency. In addition, it supports reading instruction appropriate to the child’s level of language 
proficiency. Directions for all language of first activities can be accessed by the children in their native language.  The teachers 
use pictures/videos, dramatization, audio, technology, TPR, realia, modeling, peer supports and speak in a clear voice using an 
appropriate pace to enhance comprehension in English and the content area.  All these techniques will help our ELLs to gain a 
better understanding of the New York State Learning Standards. 
 
For students who have been receiving service 4 to 6 years, we use multiple strategies to support them in reading, writing, 
listening and speaking. We use deconstruction and reconstruction of sentences, word play and ENL Strategies to 
support ELLs.  These strategies help the students to understand the purpose of their reading, speaking, listening and writing. 
Ultimately, this will help them to achieve higher scores on the ELA, MATH & NYSESLAT Exams. In addition, we provide 
instruction in grammar and word usage. This enables students to identify the grammatical and /or word usage errors in 
assigned reading and writing materials.   
 
For students who have been here long-term, we focus on understanding synonyms, antonyms and homonyms, stress 
vocabulary acquisition, syntax, grammar, sentence structure, reading comprehension, and composition writing.  Students are 
grouped according to their reading levels.  An emphasis placed on reading instruction is based on units of study in different 
genres: social studies and science are integrated in reading. To further improve their academic language, students acquire the 
ability to analyze reading materials and to understand the purpose of reading and writing. They are offered to participate in 
our Title III After-School program which is specifically for English Language Learners, and they are offered extended day 
assistance as well.  Instruction for students in this category focuses on refining grammar, improving reading comprehension, 
and becoming better writers.   
 
Our plan for continuing support for transitional students who reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT includes following the 
state mandate allowing these students to continue receiving the same testing modifications they received as ELLs for up to 
two years after passing the NYSESLAT. Students who’ve recently tested out of our ENL program work with our teachers in a 
small group setting.  The students are matched based on their academic needs and instructional goals, which are set according 
to their academic levels in reading, writing and mathematics.  When possible, these students also meet as a transitional group 
in which instruction is tailored to their needs. There is ongoing planning and articulation between the classroom teachers and 
the ENL Provider to ensure that instruction is congruent.  All ELLs in grades 1st-8th grade are also encouraged to participate in 
any Extended Day, Title III After-School and Saturday ELA & Math Test Preparation programs which are available.  
 
Additionally, students who pass out of ENL and score "commanding" or “proficient” will receive two additional years of push-in 
ENL service provided by a licensed TESOL educator.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

The school is presently using Ready Gen and GO Math as our instructional resources. Each program has Differentiated 
Instructional Activities embedded within to help meet the needs of our ELLs. For example, in the Ready Gen program, 
scaffolded instruction is provided for the English Language Learners. In the GO Math program there are language support 
materials available for teachers to use for the ELL population. In addition, teachers make child specific changes to curriculum 
to better help the ELLs in their classrooms.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL teacher presently has a program where she pushes in and works collaboratively with the classroom teacher to align 
instructional support with the NYSLS. She also pulls students out of the classroom, depending on their ENL level, in order to 
enrich their language support through writing, speaking, listening and reading. In the Pull Out model, students with IEP goals 
work in small groups where their needs are better met. Please note chart 5.1 for specifics as to student levels and 
associated minutes of push in vs. pull out instruction.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We have several intervention programs available to support ELLs, in the areas of ELA, math and other content areas. Title III 
helps provide ELLs with a language para as needed, Speech services, Guidance, SETSS, Spanish, Science Test Prep, Saturday 
Test Prep and Extended Day services for all ELL students.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming 2017-2018 school year we have added the addition of a full time TESOL licensed educator to provide 
additional ENL services to our ELLs.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs for ELLs have been discontinued 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs have equal access to all school programs, as we do not limit their access to any program in which the school 
runs. Additionally, we offer supplemental services to ELL’s, through after school programs. This year the Central Queens Y is 
providing a free after-school program for all students in grades K-5, in which our ELLs are invited to participate.  In addition, 
there is a Title III after-school program which offers ELLs the opportunity to incorporate the reading of drama, non-fiction and 
fiction books to  reinforce academic vocabulary and focusing on a wide depth of knowledge.  Students in this program meet 
twice a week.  Additionally, English Language Learners are able to attend our RTI and Lunch Time Intervention made possible 
by volunteer teachers. This service provides additional support that supplements regular classroom and ENL instruction.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The materials used to support ELLs are varied.  We utilize a multi-sensory approach to learning which includes using graphics, 
pictures, music, culinary activities, computer software, lap tops, iPads, e-books, smart boards, Mimio, and various 
available internet services, which are secondary to continuous oral and written skill instruction. We also include curriculum-
based field trips to offer hands on experiences to our ELLs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native Language support is delivered by use of materials that have instructions and words in both languages for students.  In 
addition, we have multicultural books and materials that have vocabulary and content area information in both languages for 
students.  We also have picture dictionaries in several languages available in both the school library as well as 
in ENL classroom.      
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services, supports and resources correspond to the ELLs’ age and grade levels, since all ELLs are grouped according to 
"grade/age appropriateness." This means that all ELLs, unless they were previously held over, remain in a classroom with 
students who are their age/grade level regardless of English proficiency.  This allows all ELLs to be supported in an age 
appropriate manner 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The materials used to support ELLs are varied.  We utilize a multi-sensory approach to learning which includes using graphics, 
pictures, music, culinary activities, computer software, lap tops, iPads, e-books, smart boards,  mimio, and various available 
internet services, which are secondary to continuous oral and written skill instruction. We also include curriculum-based field 
trips to offer hands on experiences to our ELLs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We offer an offsite ENL Summer School Program.  The teachers facilitating the program use summer reading lists, picture 
books, audio books, and music to help support the ELL students in the program before the beginning of the school year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish Language Class is available to all students, including ELLs in grades 6-8.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The school provides professional development for all teachers of ELLs every Monday from the hours of 2:30-3:45. It is during 
these meetings in which professional development is geared toward the best practices and instruction as well as the inquiry 
process, which has been proven to help provide successful instruction to our ELL population.   
The process of professional development (PD) offered to teachers of ELLs to help support them as the engage in the CCLS is 
ongoing. Teachers started to receive PD on these standards when they were initially rolled out several years ago, and continue 
to receive PD weekly.   
 
This year the new ENL push in/pull out requirements state that more push in time is required. The ENL team (Ms. Huh and Mrs. 
Pawelczak) provided a PD to staff on how to support, differentiate instruction and materials and how to provide 
comprehensible input for all ELL’s. In addition, classroom teachers and administrators were given the opportunity to attend 
the UFT ELL all day conference.  Our school, since January, has been implementing the Project Based Learning (PBL) model 
throughout each grade, in which PDs were given, to help make learning more hands on and interactive for all learners. The PBL 
model incorporates the four modalities (listening, speaking, reading and writing), which helps provide successful instruction for 
our ELL population. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 
Furthermore, the ENL team has participated in a number of PD, to enhance professional knowledge in support of our ELLs. 
These include but are not limited to: Nuts and Bolts of ELL-Related Items (Division of English Language Learners and Student 
Support); ELL Reports and Regulations (Division of English Language Learners and Student Support) ; PD of ENL Showcase @ 
P.S107 & P.S 24, Updated ELL policy meeting and Informing of new NYSITELL testing modifications. By attending these PDs, the 
classroom teachers and the ENL teachers are given more tools, strategies learned how to better service the ENL students in the 
classroom while working collaboratively with each other to ensure that the NYSLS are being met.     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
Since PS/MS 200 is a Pre-K -8th grade school, students have the consistency of having the same ENL teacher from elementary 
school to middle school.  In addition, this year Elementary ELLs, in grades 3-5 will be invited to participate in an after-
school program which will focus on the math and writing process. This will help prepare these students for middle school, 
since this is the area in which most ELLs struggle.  We will also be conducting a similar program for 6th-8th grade ELLs to help 
prepare them for the writing and math they will need to do once they get to high school.    
 
ENL Professional Development is available to all personnel along with the opportunity to turnkey to their peers. ENL teachers 
and staff members can attend monthly Professional Development Workshops.  The professional development plan for ELL 
personnel at our school is to attend professional workshops, out of the building usually given by the Bureau of Education 
& Research and Office of English Language Learners, and district meetings, which are then turn keyed to the staff during 
monthly faculty and grade conferences presentations; and staff development conferences are given to all staff as needed. 
These meetings support both classroom teachers and paras by giving them ENL strategies for their ELL’s, while helping the staff 
meet the mandated 7.5 hours of ELL training. Teachers maintain their own record of requirement hours, and a copy is kept in 
their respective teacher’s file. At the current time, we have three paraprofessionals working with ENL students, who have 
other learning needs. Following areas have been addressed in professional development given in a school year: 
 
Classroom teachers and administrators were given the opportunity to attend the UFT ELL all day conference in October of 
2016. Our school since January, has been implementing the Project Based Learning (PBL) model throughout each grade, in 
which PDs were given to all teachers, to help make learning more hands on and interactive for all students. The PBL model 
incorporates the four modalities (listening, speaking, reading and writing), which helps provide teachers with the tools to 
deliver successful instruction for our ELL population. Furthermore, the ENL team has participated in a number of professional 
developments, to enhance professional knowledge in support of our ELLs. 
 
These PDs include but are not limited to: Nuts and Bolts of ELL-Related Items (Division of English Language Learners and 
Student Support), which was given in September of 2016; ELL Reports and Regulations (Division of English Language Learners 
and Student Support), which was given in October of 2016; ENL Showcase @ P.S107 & P.S 24, which was given in January of 
2017; Updated ELL policy meeting, which was given in May of 2017,, and Informing of new NYSITELL testing modifications, 
which was given in June of 2017. By attending these PDs, the classroom teachers and the ENL teachers are given additional 
tools, strategies and learned how to better service the ENL students, while working collaboratively their classroom teachers to 
ensure that the NYSLS are being met.     
 
Additional professional development dates are offered to staff through the network and other opportunities will arise 
throughout the year.  Staff and student programs are available to help make the transition from the elementary to middle and 
middle to high school as smooth as possible. In place are Orientation meetings, Moving-Up ceremonies, and opportunities to 
visit the schools.  High School test-prep courses are also available, as are counseling services for parents and students alike. 
 
The ENL teacher attends IEP conferences as needed and offers input on students’ IEPs. She also attends PPT meetings, faculty 
and grade conferences and participates in ongoing consultations with classroom and the Special Education staff about how to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

utilize ENL strategies, as well as to receive feedback from the teachers. During this time, the ESL teacher participates in the 
planning and gives input on better ways to service our ELL population, in Literacy, Math, Social Studies and Science. We discuss 
differentiated instruction, depth of knowledge, New York State Learning standards, using smarter strategies, reviewing the 
grade lessons and curriculum maps, as well as implementing multi-sensory approaches to learning. In addition, we have 
articulation meetings with ENL teacher and class /subject teacher twice a year. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Ms. Huh and Mrs. Pawelczak and the students’ classroom teachers have time in their schedule weekly for parent engagement. 
These meetings take place every Tuesday and provide the ENL teachers and the classroom teachers an opportunity to meet 
with the parents outside of the 4 parent teacher conferences per year. Parents who require interpretation and/or translation 
are provided with these services through supported staff, with communication in their home language. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

In addition to activities such as family nights, annual literacy events and other school sponsored events, in which the parents 
of ELLs are encouraged to attend; our ELLs participate in an after-school program which has opportunities for ELL parents to 
get involved with the school community. Information about these events is sent home in the parent’s home language and the 
events have translators available when possible.  
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Interpreters are provided for Parent-Teacher conferences, coordinate by the Parent Coordinator.  Inquiry is made to teacher for 
specific languages required in addition to parents personally requesting an interpreter through the P.C. Health and Nutrition 
workshops provided in Spanish through the Cornell University Extension Program.  The P. T. A. also includes parents off ELL to assist 
in events where language is not an issue such as during picture day, book fairs, bake sales.  Parents are able to help with managing 
students and escorting to and from classrooms. 
Parent Coordinator also works specifically with teachers to provide individualized translated documents such as homework 
assignments, trip information and communication of parent and teacher.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kevin McAuliffe, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Several staff members help to assess the school's written translation and oral interpretation needs. The Pupil 
Accounting Secretary, ENL teacher, and Parent Coordinator refer to ATS and/or Home Language Identification 
Survey data and students' blue emergency cards to determine the most updated translation and interpretation 
needs and to provide that support. We send home translated documents that DOE website provides, and our staff 
is able to utilize the DOE's translation and interpretation services. If needed, we would reach out to vendors to 
help with translation services. When a new student enrolls, the parent completes the Home Language 
Identification Survey, if it has not already been completed at the previous DOE school. In addition, the school has 
access to the RAPL reports which will allow us to run reports for the parents preferred language for any given 
grade.

shared with staff, with the School 
Leadership Team, and with parents 
at a PTA meeting and at "Coffee and

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All staff members will be given PD and materials about the LTI Plan. Each staff member will be given explicit 
information and instructions on how to utilize the Translation and Interpretation Unit for document translation and 
over the phone contact in the parent home language or preferred language of communication. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The Pupil Accounting Secretary, ENL teacher, and Parent Coordinator will assemble a master list of all students and 
families that require translation and interpretation services. We will put in place a system to ensure that any parent 
notices or letters home are translated early enough to be sent home on time. This system will also help us to be 
prepared for needed interpretation services when calls home are made or when there are meetings at school. 
Additionally, in order to keep parents informed the Welcome Poster provided by the DOE is posted at the front of the 
school, and additional materials such as the Parents' Bill of Rights, Parents' Guide to Language Access, and the 
Language ID Guide is available at the security desk and the main office, as well as in the parent coordinator's office.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Annually, we ask parents to fill out a parent survey about our school. This survey provides us with fantastic insight as 
to the school community and curriculum, as well as the quality and availability of services. This allows us to review our 
current system and make changes as needed. Additionally, the school is working on scheduling a focus group of 
parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to help us gather feedback.
