Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The P.S.287 Mission Statement  

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

As a responsive community of parents and educators, PS287 recognizes our ethical responsibility to promote learning 
that ensures the future of our children. We are concerned about how our children are growing up. Therefore, as our 
children continue to evolve, we will adapt our educational practices in order to give children experiences that will 
foster student achievement and independence. It is our purpose to expose children to a variety of academic, cultural, 
artistic, athletic and technological learning experiences. P.S. 287 students will know that we want them to learn, for it 
will be evident that we have set the stage for exploration beyond the confines of the classroom. At P.S287 we intend 
to close the achievement gap by narrowing the digital divide. In doing so, our children will become the innovators 
of tomorrow.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

We will use the data from the 201 8 School Snapshot Report to drive our focus this year in the area of math. We 
realized that while we made progress in student proficiency in ELA we still have to make gains in math specifically the 
area of mathematical reasoning and multi-step problem solving. Students need more opportunities to express 
themselves in writing in order to explain their rationales for problem solving. We want to give children more practice 
expressing their mathematical thinking in writing.  

 

We will use the NYC Department of Education's STEM Framework to help guide the work as we prepare learning 
activities that are more academically rigorous and engaging. The STEM curriculum will allow teachers and students to 
engage in activities that promote critical thinking and design. We serve a population of students who receive related 
services as per their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). We will continue to incorporate the use of assistive / 
instructional technology into our general education program to ensure that we are maximizing student learning in the 
least restrictive environment.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We current serve 87.9% students who are in economic need, 28.2% students with disabilities and 6.3% students who 
are English language learners. The main need is providing access to curricula designed to meet the needs of all of 
learners and to attend to the individualized needs of all students. Our goal is to provide equity and access for all. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school made the most progress in the element of strong family and community ties. We worked very hard this 
year to invite parents into the school for parent workshops. With the support of the Our Communities Our Children 
community based organization we held Get Your Baby Ready for School workshops twice a month on Fridays. This 
program was very informative and helpful to parents and staff. We continued with our parent gatherings during the 
holidays and just put much more emphasis on community engagement. Our school rating in this area increased on 
our 2018 School Snapshot Report.  

 

The area we need to focus on in the coming school year is rigorous instruction. Our goal is to increase our number of 
students performing at grade level in English language arts and mathematics. We are currently focused on adjusting 
our curricula decisions to better serve the needs of our students especially our higher performing students and 
students who are approaching grade level standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

 

In order for the school leader to ensure and support the quality implementation of a systematic plan of rigorous and 
coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted 
to meet the needs of students the school has elected to use a digital curriculum for the 2018-2019 school year. P.S.287 
has always been strong in the use of instructional technology. This year we will continue to use the core curriculum that 
we have used in the past. We will provide all students in grade 2 through 5 with personal tablets with preloaded core 
curriculum. The digital curriculum will allow school administrators, teachers and parents to review and monitor student 
progress in a more systematic way. The digital media will increase the level of rigor and prepare the students for the 
demands of college and career readiness. As a Focus School we have the opportunity to receive supplemental services 
provided to us from MyOn Digital Library and Mathemats.

This year we will use Pearson's Realize as the platform for our digital curriculum. We will use ReadyGen and 
Investigations Math curriculum for our reading and math instruction. We selected these programs because we realized 
that the structure of the lessons and units of study are aligned with the expectations of the Danielson Framework and 
the Citywide Expectations. Specifically the use of questioning and discussion techniques, rigorous and authentic 
performance tasks and assessments. This work is also impacting curricular changes in how teachers plan and implement 
the science and social studies curriculum. Teachers will follow the scope and sequence for social studies and science. We 
use the core curriculum materials for all content areas. For our Pre-k program we use the Creative Curriculum and the 
NYCDOE Units of Study which provides theme based units. Teacher will follow the NYC STEM framework for science, 
technology, engineering and math. 

In classrooms teachers follow the workshop model providing time for whole group and small group instruction for 
students. With the assistance of paraprofessionals, related service providers, student teachers and NYU Tutors 
instruction will be facilitated using a parallel teaching model. Classrooms are organized to promote cooperative learning 
in a safe and orderly environment. All students will have personal tablets to use for daily instruction. Student work will 
contain actionable feedback grounded in rubric assessments that are displayed inside and outside of the classrooms. 
During instruction students are engaged in:  

 Text Based & Concept Discussions 

 Team Talk & Reading Analysis using digital media 

 Close Reading of Texts using digital media 

 Problem Solving and Design  

 Multiple Entry Points/ Differentiated Learning Activities using digital media 

 Common Core Standards Driven instruction 

 Student Rubrics with Actionable Feedback 

 iPad & Smartboard technologies in all classrooms 

 Word Work Vocabulary & Writing Conventions 

 Small Group Instruction/Parallel Teacher Support  

 Independent Practice / Flexible Group Work 

 Student Reflection and Thinking Share Out using digital media 

 Reflection Writing Across Content Areas

According to feedback from the schools most recent 2016-2017 Quality Review our strengths and weaknesses are as 
follows: 

Strengths  

Structures and systems are in place to provide staff with training to communicate and understand high, school-wide 
expectations in support of their initiatives. The school leader and staff communicate and offer feedback to help families 
understand their child’s progress towards the national educational standards. This impacts the school positively because 
ongoing structures hold staff accountable for school-wide expectations. Parents understand their child’s progress 
towards college and career readiness.  

Areas of improvement  

Teacher practices include questioning and other scaffolds, but have yet to provide students with explicit multiple entry 
points or to elicit high levels of thinking in student discussion and work products. We plan to address this area of 
concern by making sure that teacher strategies are consistent in leading students to higher-ordering thinking in student 
discussions and work products, and in high levels of engagement. We will achieve this endeavor by creating a school 
culture that uses a digital media platform to increase academic rigor and student engagement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Ensure that learning tasks are specifically designed to fully reflect a strategic integration of the next generation leaning 
standards. Administration will ensure the coherence of instruction to further promote college and career readiness for 
all students, from grade to grade in all core subject areas. By June of 2019 100% of teachers will design instructional 
mini- tasks that incorporate the LDC mini-task as evidenced by an increase in rigorous, standards aligned and coherent 
instruction across all grades and subject areas specifically in the area of mathematics. This will be measured by at least a 
20% increase in the end of year grade performance on the New York City Performance Assessments compared to the 
beginning of the year assessments.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

The Guiding Principles of Peace and Unity System and the Village Family Group Protocol are at the heart of our efforts to 
create a supportive environment for all community members. The Guiding Principles of Peace and Unity System provide 
the children of our school community with many resources. One of those resources is our Village Family Group Protocol. 
Through our supplemental family protocol children receive additional support in their development. The schools 
caregivers are a trustworthy, caring and determined group of adults who are required to have the best interest of the 
child at heart.” – Michael West-Director of the GPPU program 

For the past Ten years P.S.287 has implemented The Guiding Principles of Peace and Unity System created by former 
Dean of Academics and Student Support Services, Mr. Michael West. As a school community we endeavored to create a 
school wide structure to help build the character of our students. We want our students to feel safe and connected to 
the adults in the school community. Mr. West designed the G.P.P.U system to provide intervention and a different 
approach to managing discipline issues by teaching our students to strive for positive recognition by living according to 
the Guiding Principles of Peace and Unity.

This program is a way for teachers to encourage a culture of learning in their classrooms and to ensure that the 
management of student behavior and the social and emotional supports necessary for children to achieve academic 
success are in place. The G.P.P.U provides professional development linking the expectations of the G.P.P.U program 
and the Danielson Framework for all administrators and teaching staff. It is our shared belief that when students 
understand their role as members of a family group within a school community then they will be better able to self 
correct their behavior against a well structure and articulated set of shared beliefs upheld by the caregivers in the 
school. When behavior is managed well in classrooms then students are better equipped to cognitively engage with the 
curriculum.  

This work has impacted our school tremendously. Our school tone is one of respect and students over the last seven 
years who have been with us conduct themselves in a way that reflects these beliefs.  

In 2015 P.S. 287 was recognized as the UFT 2015 BRAVE contest winner for our GPPU program. It is an honor to receive 
such a distinction from the United Federation of Teachers. We were recognized because the G.P.P.U program 
discourages drug abuse, bullying, promotes a healthy lifestyle, supports family, teamwork and establishes a constructive 
model for behavior. 

Presently in the 2018 school year, we are strengthening the work we started ten years ago with our GPPU program in 
order to support the whole child. The City has implemented the Equity and Access for All initiative and we have found 
that the GPPU program has done a great job at supporting us in this endeavor. We continue to educate our teachers on 
the state, city, district and school data that addresses disproportionality. We review our response to crisis intervention 
and we provide training on becoming a trauma informed school to all staff members. We are partnering with 
Community Based Organizations to help us support our goals in as relates to supporting the whole child. We have found 
that our parent workshops provide a good base for additional data and support. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
We will continue to create an environment where students are at the forefront of our agenda and where equity and 
access to a rigorous and supportive classroom is accessible for all learners. Our goal will be to increase parent and 
student confidence in our instructional and support programs. By June of 2019 we will see at least a 40% increase in 
student/parent survey data that reviews student/parent perception of the school.

● One of the biggest highlights of our school is the professional development structure supported by the P.S.287 
Teacher Effectiveness Network of Teachers. The Teacher Effectiveness Network is a group of diverse educators that 
come together to assess the needs of the teaching staff and to support them by providing them with focused and 
differentiated professional development. The data collected by the team is analyzed and shared. Together with the 
administration, professional development workshops are agreed upon. 

● Administration and the Teacher Effectiveness Network host Tenure Workshops for District 13 new teachers. The 
Teacher Effectiveness Network in collaboration with members of the UFT and the Office of the Superintendent align 
expectations of documenting teacher growth and demonstrating effectiveness as evidenced by Teacher Tenure 
Portfolios.  

● The TEN team hosts professional development for teachers on Mondays. The school has seen great improvement in 
teacher practice as a result of the professional development conducted by the TEN team during Monday professional 
development.

The principal supports staff, using classroom observations as the school identifier, a tool which allows teachers to self-
reflect on areas which they identified as needs. 

The P.S.287 Teacher Effectiveness Network is composed of teacher leaders across grades. The teachers provide 
mentoring and coaching to their colleagues as it relates to Danielson and other school wide initiatives. The TEN team 
meets with the Principal to discuss areas of growth for teachers school wide, based on observations and teacher 
requests as well. The team structures and plans professional development for the school. Instructional decisions are 
made in collaboration with the TEN team and the Principal. 

We will continue to work on the feedback from the 2017 Quality Review. It was observed that there is a need to make 
sure that the school core expectations are evident throughout all classrooms. As a result the principal during frequent 
cycles of observations is not only looking to see that the citywide expectations are met, but also evaluating whether or 
not the school wide belief systems about how children learn best are evident in all classrooms.

We have an Assistant Principal on staff that is able to support teachers using the Danielson Framework. The school is 
also working to build capacity in all teachers leaders. We have a strong belief in developing teacher leaders and we work 
closely with all staff to encourage a pipeline toward teacher, parent and administrative leadership. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Continue to ensure that instructional strategies and beliefs are clearly reflected in lesson routines and student work, 
thus fostering full understanding of how students learn at all grade levels. By March of 2019 75% of teachers will have 
received feedback on their instructional practice based on the Danielson Framework with specific attention given to the 
area of designing coherent instruction and cognitive engagement as evidenced by the Advance Teacher Evaluation 
System.

At PS.287 we do our very best to assist parents in understanding the educational process for their students. With the 
introduction of the common core standards the requirements and demands have changed rapidly. We try to give parent 
as much information as possible for them to assist us with the education of their students. Many parents come to us and 
ask how they can help work with their children. They sign up for extracurricular programs and have been very vocal in 
requesting the type of assistance they need to support their children academically.  

We are most proud of our Annual Parent Crystal Awards in which we recognize parents who go above and beyond in 
their PTA participation at the school. We know that it is not always easy and we honor those parents who are always 
supporting their child and helping the school community to improve. 

This year we are focused on building relationship in order to continue to establish trust. We host parent Night Outings, 
participate in the Walks for Breast Cancer and attend community events that pertain to community related concerns 
together.

We know the there are times when students may need additional services to help them thrive. We have hired a full-time 
school psychologist who informs the parents about the referral process and ensures that parents are fully informed of 
their rights. We do our best to connect families with outside family resources that would be of benefit to the family. 

As a result 94% of parents feel that the school offers a wide enough variety of courses, extracurricular activities, and 
services and 95% of parents are satisfied with the education that their child has received 

This year we are focused on creating a textbook free environment for students. With this new program our parents will 
also become more aware of how the use of instructional technology will enhance the quality of education for their 
children. Each child will receive a tablet and ebooks will be preloaded on each tablet. In addition we have purchase 
online tutoring programs for students. This helps the school to monitor student progress regularly and take action to 
help accelerate student achievement. Parents are also able to help their students at home with the assistance of the 
online technology provided by the school. There are many families moving into the Downtown Brooklyn area and we 
want to make sure that P.S.287 is a top option. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
Continue to build a culture of mutual trust in order for parents to fully engage in their child’s education and to be better 
able to assist their children academically. By June 2019 95% of parents will agree that the school keeps them informed 
about services students, such as tutoring, after-school programs, or workshops at school as evidenced by the NYC 
School Survey.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
90% of the teaching staff at PS 287 is comprised of NYS certified and Tenured teachers. Newly hired teachers become 
part of our highly professional staff and are provided an extremely successful mentoring program and receive 
professional development in all curriculum areas throughout the year. New teachers receive ongoing assistance with 
organizing their classrooms to create an effective environment, classroom management, developing lesson plans, 
engaging students in learning and assessing student learning. Our model/lead teachers provide guidance, support and 
training for new teachers utilizing model classrooms as lab sites for developing teaching methodology. Teachers are 
taught a common language through the use of Danielson’s framework. Demonstration lessons are provided so that 
new teachers can implement successful techniques and practices in their classrooms. All teachers in PS 287 are 
supported with high quality professional development workshops which are differentiated to address the needs of 
both new and experienced staff, directing their attention to individual strengths and weaknesses, grade level needs, 
content area focus and teacher learning styles. Teachers providing AIS are given an opportunity to meet and share 
ideas with teachers whose students they service. Throughout the year, we work on our curriculum mapping in all 
curriculum areas. This provides our teachers and administrators time to collaboratively reflect, assess, plan and 
provide a focus throughout the year. These meetings also provide administrators an opportunity to encourage and 
support staff in renewing and refining their craft regularly. Frequent cycles of observation and feedback drive our 
professional development programs. Our goal is to ensure the gradual and incremental learning for all of our 
students. The ongoing learning of our professional staff will support us in attaining our goal of improving our students’ 
performance in both mathematics and ELA. PS 287 structured and targeted mentoring program is a major element of 
the support and professional development for new teachers. This will ensure high quality teaching to ascertain that all 
students including students with disabilities and English language learners receive sound instruction by highly 
qualified teachers .  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We will devote sessions this year toward implementing the Next Generation Learning Standards in both ELA and 
Math. The administration, staff developer, Talent Coach, and Brooklyn North Field Support Specialists will contribute 
toward this high quality professional development. Staff members and school principal and AP will attend

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information, 
early intervention services, etc.). 
Our students in Pre-Kindergarten are held to the Pre-K Common Core State Standards. We will begin to transition to 
the next generation learning standards. Pre-Kindergarten teachers are expected to plan curriculum that is aligned to 
the the standards . Teachers expose their students to pre-literacy skills, mathematical concepts, social studies and 
science units of study created by the Division of Early Childhood . Such rigorous instruction ensures our students are 
prepared for the elementary school program. We use the Units of Study online and the Creative Curriculum as a 
resource for the Pre-K program. Teachers use work sampling to support students in preschool as they transition to 
early childhood programs. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In order to decide upon the Measures of Teacher Practice Local and State assessments we had to comprise a team of 
teachers to inform the Principal on the Local measures that teachers would be evaluated on. This team meets 
regularly to advise the Principal and the larger teacher community. The team is also responsible for professional 
development and is vital in the decision making process of the school. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43 

 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K287, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S.287 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In order to access the early literacy skills of ELLs, PS 287 uses Measuring Up Live, ReadyGen assessments and Lexile. These 
assessment tools provide insights regarding individual strengths and weaknesses of the students in terms of phonics, 
vocabulary, phonological skills, and reading and writing skills. The data serves in aiding instruction and setting teacher/student 
goals to meet the linguistic, cultural and educational needs of all ELLs.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our school is held responsible for making adequate Annual Yearly Progress to make sure that all ELL meet the states'proficient 
level of achievement on the state academic assessment. In addition, students need to make the Annual Measurable 
Achievement Objectives (AMAO). Our ELLs are part of the entire school system, apart from being in the ESL program, they 
receive a content area instruction in the general classroom where high-expectations are set. The students go through the 
proper identification process and formative and summative assessment to provide for individual needs and to guide 
instruction.The school keeps the complete data for each student in order to calculate growth in language proficiency from year 
to year.  Also the progress of the former ELLs is being monitored in order to provide additional help and support if necessary. 
Every year the NYSESLAT provides an insight about our students making gains and moving up from one proficiency level to 
other. This year one of our Kindergarten students, we aslo have one advanced student in the 4th garde and one in the fifth. 
The rest of our ELL population consists of the first grade beginners and a newcomer who need additional time and support to 
develop their skills and also move up from the Beginning level. Apart from the state standarized tests, the teachers use also 
the informal assessments to track the success of ELLs in the classroom. The most common practices are performance-based 
assessment and portfolio assessment.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All students at P.S. 287, including the ELLs,  undergo the universal screening assessment that identifies students who may be at 
risk of not meeting the standards through benchamrks and set criteria. The first one is the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) that informs the teachers about the linguistic factors and educational background that could be influencing the 
student and their teaching instruction. ELLs' literacy skills are also assessed so that we could use that data to guide instruction 
and to provide support structures inside and outside of the classroom. If ELLs do not show much progress, teachers meet to 
identify and discuss the areas that need more intensive, targeted intervention. The progress is constantly monitored and used 
to inform the instruction, and possibly, if the rate is still much lower than the peers from the same background, make 
educational decisions about additional special education services.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The 2015 NYSESLAT results reveal that our ELLs are making steady gains on the assessments by moving from one proficiency 
level to the next or within a level in order to become language proficient. Two newcomer ELLs who entered at the Advanced 
level on the NYSITELL and LAB-R are now performing at the Commanding level of English proficiency. Likewise, the two 
Kindergarten students who began at the Entering level based on the NYSITELL results are now at the Emerging and Entering 
levels. According to this data, students are making progress each year. The majority of the ELLs are currently in the lower 
grades (i.e., K-2) and quickly become proficient in Listening and Speaking (social language- BICS). We strive to provide all ELLs 
with quality instruction and a rigorous curriculum with specific tasks that target their reading and writing skills (academic 
language-CALP).   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In the freestanding ENL program, instruction for ELLs is delivered through a combination of stand-alone ENL and 
integrated ENL depending on the students' proficiency levels. As per CR Part 154.2, ELLs in grades K-8 that are at the 
Entering and a Emerging levels of English proficiency must receive at least 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week; 
Entering ELLs must receive equal minutes (i.e., 180 minutes) of Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL in ELA, whereas, 
Emerging ELLs must receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA, but have the 
option of choosing either Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL in any content area for the remaining 90 minutes of ENL 
instruction. ELLs in grades K-8 that are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels of English proficiency must receive at 
least 180 minutes of ENL instruction. Transitioning ELLs must receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in ELA, but have 
the flexibility of choosing Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL in a content area for the other 90 minutes of ENL 
instruction. Expanding ELLs only receive Integrated ENL, but it can be in ELA or another content area. Lastly, 
Commanding ELLs receive ESL services for an additional two years; the 90 minutes of ENL instruction they receive 
must be integrated ENL, but it can be in ELA or another content area. Students are grouped heterogeneously (i.e., 
mixed proficiency levels) by grade and are usually placed in the same class for ease of integrated ENL instruction. 
Depending on the group size and the students' English proficiency levels, students from multiple grades with no more 
than 2 grade spans between them may be grouped together for Stand-Alone ENL instruction.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Explicit ENL and ELA minutes are delivered in the freestanding ENL model through a combination of stand-
alone ENL instruction that focuses on English language skills that will support students in the content area classes and 
integrated ENL instruction that consists of co-planning and co-teaching by the classroom content area teachers and the ESL 
teacher. For the 2015-2016 school year, we currently have 8 ELLs in K-5 grades at our school; they range from the Entering to 
Commanding levels and depending on their language proficiency level, they receive anywhere from 90 minutes to 360 minutes 
of ENL instruction per week. At PS 287, program for ELLs adhere to the Children First Initiative’s uniform curriculum. Programs 
use a balanced approach to literacy, including high-quality instructional practices that facilitate academic excellence for 
ELLs.  Also, the ELL program adheres to NYS Common Core Learning Standards. In addition, ELLs receive 600 minutes of ELA 
instruction per week through the ReadyGen curriculum and depending on the grade, they receive one to two periods of Math 
everyday through the Go Math! program; the ReadyGen and Go Math! programs have ESL specific components which help the 
ESL teacher align the ESL and general education class curricula. All English Language Learners (ELLs) are instructed in English 
using Total Physical Response, Cooperative Learning and the Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach. In the ESL 
classroom, co-planning and co-teaching occurs between the classroom teachers and the ESL teacher in order to provide 
integrated ENL instruction in the various content areas to help ELLs acccess the content while developing their language skills. 
Many different practices are utilized for ENL instruction; they include scaffolding, modeling, bridging, schema building, 
contextualization, text representation and metacognition.

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Core content is delivered in the Freestanding ENL model through integrated ENL instruction whereby the classroom 
content area teachers and the ESL teacher meet weekly to co-plan instruction to include content area and language objectives 
so that they can co-teach the content while targeting specific language skills. In order to help ESL students to achieve 
proficiency in language and academics so that they could attain the same standards established for all students at each grade 
level, the Articulation Forms are filled out monthly by the classroom teachers, and common core curriculum is shared via 
online resources . The Articulation Forms serve as communication between ESL teacher and content area teachers to plan ESL 
curriculum and activities for each grade level. All English Language Learners (ELLs) are instructed in English using Total Physical 
Response, Cooperative Learning and Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach. In the classroom many different 
practices are utilized such as: Scaffolding, Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, Contextualization, Text Representation. The 
ESL classroom materials include Scott Foresman ESL book series that follow the principles of CALLA: the Cognitive Academic 
Language Approach. It teaches grade-level topics from the major curriculum areas, and Prentice Hall Regents ESL which is 
literature- based language acquisition program that incorporates Science, Social studies and Math altogether. With regards to 
native language support in the ESL program, the word wall often includes word native language translations and cognates. The 
students also use dictionaries and glossaries, same language speaking peer support, native language library books, and 
international websites. The teacher uses informal assessments and running records.  
Beyond explicit ESL, General Education teachers are concerned with the language needs of ELLs. Therefore, they constantly 
monitor students’ understanding of linguistically challenging material, and utilize the ELL targeted parts of the ReadyGen 
program, and Go Math! program. They use a shared reading module, a variety of phrasings and synonyms to clarify meaning, 
and scaffold the instruction with visual aids such as maps, illustrations, and graphic organizers to increase comprehension. If 
possible, the students are paired-up with an English proficient student who can assist with language translation, and help with 
the classroom activities during the day. 
Instruction is modified for newcomers by focusing on building vocabulary, developing listening comprehension, modeling 
reading and writing using visuals, realia, and providing active contextualized engagement activities. A combination of different 
second language acquisition strategies (The Natural Approach, TPR, scaffolding) are used to introduce the students to school 
routines and to basic English language skills. In the testing grades the students utilize translated glossaries for Mathematics, 
Social Studies and Science, available also on the ALBETAC website.

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                Throughout the year, we ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language by administering the 
Spanish LAB if they score at or below the level of English proficiency on the NYSITELL and providing them with testing 
accomodations such as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, alternate language versions of exams and/or translators.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our goal for the school’s LAP is to ensure that instruction is designed to meet the learning and language needs of various ELL 
subgroups. In order to meet their needs, we differentiate instruction based on their English proficency levels and subgroup. 
We have compiled data from ARIS, NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, periodic assessments, the NYSESLAT and State Assessments and 
have analyzed the results to determine the strengths and weaknesses of our ELLs in specific modalities. In order to determine 
which subgroup ELLs belong to, we use the SIFE report (RSFE) and number of years of ESL service report (RYOS) in ATS. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56 

 

a) P.S. 287 currently has no SIFEs, but if SIFEs are identified, we would make the individual needs assessment with the 
attention to their learning gaps in the instruction, monitor the progress of those students and their scores on the NYSESLAT, 
ELA and Math assessments, and provide support in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs. One of the 
options is to place such a student in a lower grade. This would be done on a case by case basis and with informed parental 
consent. Also,  we would provide additional academic intervention services (AIS) and after school services if they are available.  
b) P.S. 287 currently has all Newcomer ELLs, but none of them are new to the country. They are all currently in grades K-2 and 
range from the Entering to the Transitioning level of English proficiency. If we receive any Newcomers who are new to the 
country and require extra support, then we would provide them with AIS and if possible, the student is paired up with another 
student who can assist with language translation and help with the classroom activities during the day. For our newcomer 
students, we modify instruction by focusing on building vocabulary, developing listening comprehension, modeling reading 
and writing, using visuals, charts, gestures and realia to facilitate comprehension and providing contextualized and cooperative 
engagement activities. A combination of different second language acquisition strategies (The Natural Approach, TPR, 
scaffolding) are used to introduce the students to school routines and to basic English language skills. At this stage, our 
teachers may utilize visuals and hands-on activities to ensure the student’s understanding of content area subjects while the 
student is acquiring English. We also use a variety of strategies and materials to aid instruction; these include scaffolding, 
activating background knowledge, bridging, picture dictionaries, photo cards, realia, graphic organizers, charts and 
manipulatives. Newcomers also have access to computer assisted language learning software (i.e., CharlesBridge Reading 
program, Kidspirations, FunPhonics) that support them in developing basic reading and comprehension skills. All ELLs have 
access to web-based programs (e.g., Fun Brain, Starfall). We also provide a small collection of bilingual/native language reading 
books in the classrooms with ELLs and in the ESL library that newcomers can check out to take home. Teachers encourage ELLs 
to use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries for native language support during reading and writing activities in order to clarify 
meaning and to develop their writing skills in their native language so they can transfer these skills when they are writing in 
English. In addition, Entering and Emerging Newcomer ELLs are paired with more dominant English speakers who can provide 
good modeling during the Small Group Instruction. 
c) P.S. 287 currently does not have any Developing (i.e., ELLs receiving services from 4-6 years) ELLs. However, since most of 
these students are at the Transitioning and Expanding level of English proficiency, we would work on developing their reading 
and writing skills because we already know that ELLs' speaking and listening skills develop quicker than their reading and 
reading skills. We would provide whole-class and small-group instruction focusing on reading comprehension strategies (e.g., 
summarizing, sequencing, inferring, comparing and contrasting, drawing conclusions, self-questioning, problem solving, 
relating background knowledge, distinguishing between fact and opinion, finding the main idea).  We would also develop 
higher levels of language use in the content areas by expanding their vocabulary, teaching reading comprehension strategies, 
scaffolding academic language and modeling reading and writing through think alouds. Since the writing process is broken 
down into stage, we would focus on brainstorming activities and the use of graphic organizers to visually display ideas before 
we teach the structure and language for different types of writing. In the final stage, we will target editing of grammar, spelling 
and punctuation. 
d) P.S. 287 currently does not have any Long-Term ELLs . Like the Developing ELLs, we would provide whole-class and small-
group instruction focusing on reading comprehension strategies (e.g., summarizing, sequencing, inferring, comparing and 
contrasting, drawing conclusions, self-questioning, problem solving, relating background knowledge, distinguishing between 
fact and opinion, finding the main idea).  We would also develop higher levels of language use in the content areas by 
expanding their vocabulary, teaching reading comprehension strategies, scaffolding academic language and modeling reading 
and writing through think alouds. Since the writing process is broken down into stage, we would focus on brainstorming 
activities and the use of graphic organizers to visually display ideas before we teach the structure and language for different 
types of writing. In the final stage, we will target editing of grammar, spelling and punctuation. However, for this particular 
subgroup, we would provide additional services such as AIS, small group instruction and after school in order to help them 
make progress and eventually attain English proficency. In some cases, we may have to refer them for an evaluation if we feel 
that there is a disability that is preventing them from acquiring English. 
e) P.S. 287 currently has three Proficient / Commanding ELLs in grades 2-3. Since they are English proficient, we focus more on 
developing their reading and writing skills through the workshop model. The ESL teacher also works closely with the classroom 
teachers to design integrated content and language lessons that target specific vocabulary and language functions and 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           57 

 

structures that those students are ready to learn.  Teachers encourage ELLs to use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries for 
native language support during reading and writing activities in order to clarify meaning and to develop their writing skills in 
their native language so they can transfer these skills when they are writing in English. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our school uses the comprehensive researched based program for grades K-5, Ready Gen.  It contains precisely leveled, print-
based learning and teaching resources combined with many additional materials, like "Scaffolded Strategies" handbook with 
Spanish cognates that support language and literacy proficiency for ELLs. It also provides an ELL component that supports the 
class curriculum and provides ELLs with scaffolding instruction. All the grades are using also Go Math! program. Teachers use 
differentiated instruction and utilize visuals, different garaphic organizers and hands-on activities to ensure the students’ 
understanding of content area subjects while acquiring English. Everyday there is small class instruction and writing activities. 
Students also use  technology support with Smart Boards, laptops and online resources. P.S. 287 currently does not have any 
ELL-SWDs, but we would provide them with ENL services from our licensed ESL teacher, support services as per their IEP and 
RTI services. This enables us to meet the needs of this specific population by allowing for a majority of instruction to occur in 
small groups. Based on the individual, ESL strategies and instructional methods are utilized. Lessons for students with special 
needs are modified to address different learning styles. We ensure that teachers of students with an IEP are familiar with 
students’ particular needs and all services are provided accordingly to the IEP mandates. The ESL teacher converses and 
collaborates with the IEP contact person. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restricture environment, 
they are usually placed in Integrated Co-Teaching classrooms where they can work with their non-disabled peers and obtain 
support from two classroom teachers in addition to the ESL teacher who pushes-in to support and related service providers 
that pull-out. The ESL teacher uses the Articulation Forms as the means of communication with classroom teachers in an effort 
to maintain alignment of curricula across the grades with the ESL instruction. The teachers use and share their curriculum 
maps which include modifications for ELL-SWDs and meet during staff professional development time on Mondays. The goal is 
to plan on their instructional and educational strategies as a team and to collaborate with auxiliary staff members. Vertical 
groups meet across a grade once a week to look at the students’ work. The inquiry team works on compiling the students’ data 
and using them to target the students showing deficiencies in their learning.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The Freestanding ESL program follows the balanced Literacy model, the school's curriculum frameworks and ESL curriculum 
guides. The school uses the Ready Gen program which also includes  a specific ESL component, and Go Math! program with all 
their supports. 
Cluster teachers also serve as Academic Intervension Specialists to help classroom teachers as well as students in all areas that 
need improvements. Tier II interventions include the ESL teacher, the Resource Room teacher, and the Speech Therapist. The 
language of instruction is English. The translators over the phone or our bilingual paras are used for translations if necessary. 
IEP evaluations and parent-teacher meetings are conducted for our students with special needs. Apart from ESL program and 
other intervention programs, the classroom teachers constantly monitor students’ understanding of linguistically challenging 
material, use a variety of phrasings and synonyms to clarify meaning and scaffold the instruction with visual aids such as maps 
and illustrations to increase comprehension. We use guided reading and vocabulary quizzes to make instruction more involving 
and effective. Instruction is modified for newcomers by focusing on building vocabulary, developing listening comprehension, 
modeling reading and writing using visuals, realia, and providing active contextualized engagement activities. A combination of 
different second language acquisition strategies (The Natural Approach, TPR, scaffolding) are used to introduce the students to 
school routines and to basic English language skills. In the testing grades the students utilize translated glossaries for

Mathematics, Social Studies and Science, available also on the ALBETAC website. All of the intervention programs for ELA, 
Math and other content areas are offered in English but with the native language support whenever needed. For the state 
tests in Math and Science, the translated versions and glossaries are available.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, the ESL teacher is integrating language instruction in the ReadyGen curriculum, the GoMath! 
program and the Science and Social Studies curriculums. She will be co-planning and co-teaching with various classroom 
teachers to deliver ENL instruction within the content areas.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There are no programs/services that will be discontinued for ELLs at PS 287.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs at PS 287 participate in curricular ReadyGen and Go Math! programs. They have equal access to all afterschool programs 
and supplemental services offered in our building. Also, Tier III intervention specialists (e.g., guidance counselor, family worker, 
parent coordinator, occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech and language therapist, social worker, and psychologist) 
are also available to ELLs. All students take part in the Music Residency for Brooklyn Philharmonic program, and the Marquis 
Studio which includes Visual Arts for Pre-K and Kindergarten children and Architecture classes for 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders, all 
once a week. They have at least two periods a week of Physical Education class which is provided by classroom teachers. 
Afterschool programs for lower grades consists of dance/drama periods also provided by Marquis Studio 4 times for one hour. 
PS 287 has its own basketball team program, and BELL afterschool program for upper grades. There is a Saturday Academy 
twice a month for those students who need to improve their skills in Math and Writing   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials that are used to support ELLs include:  
Attanassio and Associates Getting Ready for the New NYSESLAT, New York State Coach: ELA, New York State 
Coach:  Mathematics, Prentice Hall regents ESL, Scott Foresman ESL, Spin by Longman, American English Today and Voyager 
Expanded Learning Program, Amazing English books, classroom library books, computer programs (i.e., Charlesbridge Reading 
Fluency, Kidspirations, FunPhonics),  internet sources (e.g., FunBrain, Starfall), listening tapes, iPad applications and SMART 
Board technology  
Because of the low number of ELL population at our school, we don't receive Title III funding.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In order to deliver home language support, we use and provide picture dictionaries, Webster dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries 
and glossaries for translations and to make content comprehensible. Spanish cognates are also provided through the 
ReadyGen prgram. We also have a small collection of bilingual/home language reading books in the ESL classroom library that 
students can check out to take home. In addition, teachers use Google translate and other online translation applications so 
that they may communicate better with newcomers.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels by leveling and 
labeling books, scaffolding text according to students' reading levels and referring to the CCLS to make sure the resources are 
aligned with grade-specific standards.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Instructional materials that are used to support ELLs include:

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ELL population is quite small. As such, we conduct orientations with the parents as they enroll their children and after the 
child is identified as an eligible candidate for ESL instructional services.  In order to ensure the identification, the appropriate 
placement and educational services for the children, on the day of registration, all of the parents are initially interviewed one-
on-one, and given a Home Language Survey (HLIS) by the licensed pedagogue, the teacher with an ESL license or the school 
principal.  In case of the language barrier, school staff members serve as translators or Translation and Interpretation Unit is 
called.  HLIS are distributed according to home languages of the parents. After the informal interview, initial screening and HLIS 
administration, the child is or is not identified as an eligible candidate for ESL instructional services.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

There are no language electives offered at our school.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school is to attend monthly district ELL liaison meetings, Office 
of ELLs' (OELL) professional developments, technical support sessions (e.g., LAP, BESIS) and other professional development 
workshops focused on ELL regulations and best practices (e.g., scaffolding, differentiation, ENL integration in the content 
areas) at faculty conferences and staff professional development days in order to meet the 50% minimum requirement of ELL-
specific professional development hours as prescribed by CR Part 80. 
The professional development offered to teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning 
Standards include providing professional development workshops throughout the year on ELL best practices that focus on co-
teaching and integrating language and content instruction. These workshops are conducted by either Ms. Cheng, the ESL 
teacher, or ESL consultants so that teachers of ELLs can meet the minimum 15% requirement of professional development 
hours centered on ELLs as prescribed by CR Part 80. Also, OELL shares many ELL-related professional development 
opportunities and educational resources that support ELL teachers as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ESL teacher and the guidance counselor provide teachers, parents and the students with information about different 
schools and help make the proper placement decision of those ELLs who transition from elementary to middle school. The 
Guidance Counselor attends the workshops and turnkeys the information that he has learned to the teachers and 
administrators who in turn educate students about different choices by supplying them with the materials and resources. 
Together with the Parent Coordinator, the Guidance Counselor organizes workshops for the parents and distributes the fliers 
and brochures informing parents about the open school days at various locations. There are links with Community-based 
Organizations and our Social Worker who represents the Woodwind Foundation helps the parents, students and the Guidance 
Counselor communicate and work with each other in assisting these ELLs.  
Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all teachers and 
50% of total hours for ENL teachers by providing ELL-specific professional development throughout the school year; they are 
conducted by either Ms. Cheng, the ESL teacher, or ESL consultants. The teachers are also informed about the professional 
development workshops and trainings provided by the OELL. Records are kept for professional development activities by 
keeping the meetings' agendas and attendance sheets.  
  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides annual individual meetings, not including mandated parent orientation meetings and DOE scheduled 
parent-teacher conferences, with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language 
proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas by meeting with parents on Tuesday 
afternoons during parent engagement time. Ms. Cheng, the ESL teacher, helps provide language translations for Spanish and 
Chinese. For all other languages, the translation and interpretation unit are called as needed. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2. Records are kept for annual individual meetings with ELL parents as well as outreach to ensure parent needs are 
accommodated (e.g., in person meetings, phone calls, letters) by documenting attendance and logging dates and notes of 
parent contact and engagement. 
3. The parent coordinator conducts workshops and sends out invitations in the parents' preferred language of communication 
so that they can also participate in PTA events and learn how to support their children better at home. Ms. Cheng, the ESL 
teacher, and bilingual paras are available for translations if necessary. The Translation and Interpretation Unit is contacted for 
other translations.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michele Rawlins, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
