Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

WAVE Prep’s mission is to ensure that every scholar develops the skills necessary to meet or exceed all academic 
standards. WAVE Prep is a multicultural learning community where scholars develop problem solving skills and 
cultural awareness while acting with passion and integrity. Personalized instruction nurtures multiple intelligences 
and meets the needs of every child through small group instruction and individualized learning plans using a data-
driven approach. The school has a unified purpose and holds the belief that every child can succeed. As a result, 
administrators and educators embrace cooperative learning opportunities and collaborate to cultivate critical thinking 
through effective planning, questioning, and a rigorous interdisciplinary curriculum. At WAVE Prep, the entire 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

educational team takes responsibility for the academic, social and emotional development of each and every child. As 
a result, scholars develop the confidence to achieve academic excellence while embracing diversity.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
A neighborhood school in Far Rockaway, WAVE Preparatory Elementary School opened in the fall of 2012 with grades 
pre-kindergarten through second, and now serves pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. From the beginning, the 
WAVE Prep team worked tirelessly to create a culture of high expectations where scholars feel safe to take risks and 
challenge each other's thinking. 

The principal has created a clear vision for WAVE Prep, which can be observed in the school’s physical environment 
and instructional practices. She collaborates with community members and builds partnerships to acquire funding for 
the construction of various projects, including a new auditorium, playground, outdoor classroom, dance studio, music 
studio, and media center. Most recently, the school initiated a community service outreach program, partnering with 
various community organizations such as St. John's Hospital and St. Mary's Star of the Sea, to teach scholars the true 
meaning of virtuousness. The school plans to continue its partnership with Disney Musicals in Schools during the 
2018-2019 school year, working with teaching artists to rehearse and perform a show on the school stage as well as 
on Broadway. The principal believes that an emphasis on the arts supports academic success by honing in on scholars’ 
creative abilities and helping them gain confidence both in and out of the classroom. WAVE Prep will also continue 
partnering with New York Edge to provide enrichment activities and academic support to scholars during after-school 
hours.  

The principal continues to spend countless hours working with her instructional cabinet to hire and train a staff 
aligned to her vision. As part of the school’s vision to graduate scholars with increased college and career readiness, 
educators work collaboratively to create and refine rigorous and engaging cross-curricular units aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. The principal promotes continuous growth and improvement for all stakeholders 
by providing opportunities for instructional leads to attend professional learning opportunities aimed at enhancing 
the school’s instructional resources and practices. The principal also allots ample time for teacher teams to 
collaborate in order to ensure alignment of the curriculum, analyze data to inform planning and share best 
instructional practices. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

WAVE Prep has a total scholar population of 555 in grades pre-kindergarten through fifth grade, with 87% of 
scholars eligible for free lunch and the remainder eligible for reduced price lunch. 317 scholars are Hispanic, 216 
scholars are black, and 19 scholars fall into other ethnic categories. The school has 89 scholars in special education, 
with 51 in a 12:1:1 setting and 38 in an ICT setting. The school currently has 167 English language learners, making 
up roughly 30% of the population. Of the ELLs, 31 are entering, 23 are emerging, 29 are transitioning, 45 are 
expanding, and 39 are commanding. The ELLs and SWDs in our school require additional support in order to reach 
grade level standards. This is especially true for the increasing number of ELLs and SWDs entering our school in 
later grades who are already far below grade level standards. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Effective school leadership, rigorous instruction, a supportive environment, teacher collaboration, and strong family-
community ties have resulted in consistent academic growth amongst the majority of scholars. Over the course of the 
2017-2018 school year, 74% of scholars in kindergarten through fifth grade made at least one year of growth in 
reading according to Fountas and Pinnell school wide assessment data. With a continued emphasis on teacher 
development, collaborative planning, and community involvement, this upward trend will continue.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Feedback from the 2018 Principal Performance Observation encouraged WAVE Prep to "continue to deepen school-
wide instructional practices through the strategic facilitation of professional learning so that teachers strategically 
plan and implement tasks that incorporate high quality supports and extensions into the curriculum so that all 
learners engage in high levels of student thinking, participation and discussion." An analysis of informal and formal 
observations also revealed inconsistencies in the use of questioning and discussion techniques, as the component 
average for 3b was 3.15. Feedback from instructional coaches further supported the need for more emphasis to be 
placed on questioning and discussion techniques that promote critical thinking and allow for productive struggle. As a 
result, the 2018-2019 Instructional Focus will target questioning and discussion techniques, guiding school 
stakeholders to support scholars in engaging in meaningful discussions that promote academic and social growth by 
actively listening, thinking critically, and responding to each other using authentic accountable talk.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Feedback from the 2018 Principal Performance Observation visit indicates numerous areas of celebration in the area 
of rigorous instruction including the development of curricula and academic tasks designed to engage scholars, 
progress them through the content, and assess their understanding as evidenced by their work products. The PPO 
further asserts that unit plans are coherent within and across the grades and highlight the connections to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Curriculum and tasks are planned to provide appropriate scaffolds and learning 
opportunities that promote high levels of scholar thinking, discussion and engagement. Teaching practices and plans 
represent the coordination of in depth content knowledge, understanding of scholars' needs and teacher 
collaboration, resulting in a series of learning opportunities that engage scholars in high level cognitive activities.  

The school community has established a culture for learning that provides all scholars with focused, effective 
feedback including clear next steps and learning goals to prepare them for the next grade while ensuring their 
ownership of the learning process. More specifically, educators and administrators track scholar progress in reading 
through unit assessments as well as Fountas and Pinnell progress monitoring and benchmark assessments and use the 
data to drive instruction to ensure scholar growth.  

According to end of year Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment data, 61% of scholars in kindergarten through fifth 
grade made at least one year of growth in reading, while 55% of scholars were on or above grade level at the end of 
the 2017-2018 school year. While our data shows tremendous growth from the 2016-2017 school year, when just 
43% of scholars were reading on or above grade level, we will continue to focus on identifying and supporting 
struggling readers and their teachers from the onset of the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, at least 57% of scholars will be on or above grade level in reading according to end of year Fountas and 
Pinnell reading assessment data.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Results from the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey showed overwhelmingly positive feedback from teachers in regards to 
'Supportive Environment'. Although WAVE Prep scored higher than the district and city averages in the 4 calculated 
measures of Supportive Environment, the two indicators related to scholars monitoring their own behavior were 
rated slightly lower than the other indicators. More specifically, 84% of teachers say that adults at their school teach 
students the skills they need to regulate their behavior (by focusing their attention, controlling their emotions, or 
managing their thinking, behavior, and feelings) and 88% of teachers say that students behave well in class even when 
the teacher isn't watching.  

As such, WAVE Prep will strive to maintain an environment where scholars not only behave in accordance with the 
WAVE Prep creed while being monitored, but also when they are not being watched. The school will offer 
professional learning opportunities and coaching support focused in the area of "2d: Managing Student Behavior" of 
the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Administration, along with SLT, will also assess educator progress in this area 
by monitoring observation feedback in 2d. By supporting teachers so that the majority receive effective or highly 
effective ratings according to the Danielson Framework for Teaching, we expect that teachers will respond at an 
increasingly positive rate to the questions related to scholars monitoring their own behavior on the NYC School 
Survey. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, leadership will use Advance data from the Danielson Framework for Teaching to improve teacher 
pedagogy in the area of "Managing Student Behavior" as evidenced by at least 80% of teachers receiving a rating of 
effective or highly effective in component 2d.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Results from the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey showed overwhelmingly positive feedback from teachers regarding 
peer collaboration, with 95% or more of teachers rating 3 out of the 4 subcategories positively. However, only 86% of 
teachers rated the 4th subcategory - teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at 
other grade levels - positively. As such, the school recognizes a need to improve school wide structures that support 
vertical alignment.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, school structures and supports for collaboration will ensure that 100% of educators participate in a 
minimum of one vertical professional learning team meeting each month as measured by an analysis of meeting 
agendas.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Goal Setting: 

● Educators review feedback from their 2017-2018 observations 
and create personal goals for improvement during the 2018-
2019 school year. During Individual Planning Conferences, the 
principal and educators review and revise their goals for the 
2018-2019 school year as needed. Administration and educators 
will determine which professional learning team they will be a 
part of based on their area(s) of strength or need. A “Teacher 
Improvement Plan” will be developed collaboratively for 
teachers who receive an ineffective or developing rating. 

Collaboration: 

● Educators meet regularly in vertical committees to develop a 
problem of practice, research aligned best practices, and plan 
school wide professional learning opportunities for colleagues. 
These committees will be centered around SEL, supporting 
ELLs/SWDs, rigorous mathematics instruction and effective 
questioning and discussion techniques. Committees will 
disseminate information to families. 

● Grade leaders will meet weekly to participate in School Wide 
Inquiry Team meetings to analyze scholar work, share best 
practices, plan and revise rigorous instruction, and problem solve 
as a team.  

● Educators participate in lesson studies within horizontal and 
vertical triads and teams, in which they plan, implement and 
reflect on their practice as a team. This work will lead to the 
development of strategies to address the needs subgroups of 
scholars including Scholars with Disabilities and English Language 
Learners.

WAVE Prep has several strengths in the area of leadership. According to feedback from one of the 2018 Principal 
Performance Observation, administrators and teachers have built a culture of professional collaborations in which 
they share insights relative to the coherence of teacher pedagogy, thus fostering improved outcomes for all learners. 
Results from the NYC School Survey reaffirmed feedback from the PPO, as teachers rated measures related to 
'Teacher Influence' overwhelmingly positively. Nonetheless, our lowest scores of 83% and 78% respectively fell in 
subcategories of this measures. More specifically, only 83% of teachers reported that they have a moderate to great 
deal of influence over school policy in the area of selecting instructional materials used in classrooms and only 78% of 
teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they have influence over the development of instructional materials. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, feedback from the 2018-2019 NYC School Survey will indicate a minimum increase of 4% in positive 
teacher feedback regarding the following two statements: 1) teachers have influence over school policy in the area of 
selecting instructional materials used in classrooms 2) teachers have influence over the development of instructional

formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to our first Principal Performance Observation (PPO) from 2018, WAVE Prep has "established school based 
structures so that teachers provide families with routine updates on student progress using a daily communication log 
and weekly progress reports. In addition, [the school has] established opportunities for parents to engage in 
workshops to support their children in reading and mathematics and also receive a monthly newsletter, which 
includes supports for families to use at home. Feedback from our second PPO visit reaffirmed our commitment to 
ongoing communication with parents stating that, "The principal has established clear, ongoing lines of 
communication with families that include daily/weekly progress reports for all students, student led conferences, 
parent academic and information based workshops, parent handbook, four report cards yearly, and online platforms, 
to deepen their understanding of college and career readiness for their children. All of these updates on progress and 
information concerning their child’s learning is empowering families to help them support their children in meeting 
and exceeding the academic expectations."  

While feedback from both PPO visits highlights the many systems WAVE Prep has in place to support strong family 
and community ties, ensuring that all scholars are in attendance daily remains a challenge. The school's attendance 
team, which includes a full time Pupil Accountant Secretary, Social Worker and Parent Coordinator, works diligently 
alongside administration to monitor scholar lateness and attendance on a daily basis and make outreach to families. 
As a result, WAVE Prep surpassed its attendance goal for the 2017-2018 school year with an overall average of 
93.35%. The WAVE Prep attendance team will continue to work tirelessly alongside educators and administrators to 
maintain or improve our attendance average. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, WAVE Prep staff, including the Parent Coordinator, Pupil Accountant Secretary, and School Social Worker, 
will monitor daily attendance and make outreach to families in order to maintain a yearly attendance average of at least 
93%.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
To ensure instruction by highly qualified staff, educators are recruited and assigned based on the certification and 
license areas needed. As per our current BEDS, 100% of the staff is fully licensed. 

Strategies to attract highly qualified educators include recruitment of potential candidates at job fairs, review of the 
Open Market application process, collaboration with Teaching Fellows/Teach for America, contact with universities 
and colleges, and recommendations by staff members and colleagues. A rubric will be used to evaluate resumes and 
cover letters to determine if candidates are qualified to move to the next level of the hiring phase. Selected applicants 
will then complete a demonstration lesson and interview for administrators and a hiring committee.  

Once applicants are selected and the staff for the coming year is complete, administrators work with School Wide 
Inquiry Team members to determine the most appropriate assignment for both new and returning educators, 
considering educators preferences, strengths and weaknesses. The plethora of support provided to educators by ENL 
and IEP specialists, lead and mentor teachers, and administrators promotes teacher retention. Building time into the 
schedule to allow for meaningful collaboration to take place also fosters an environment of collegiality, leading to 
greater teacher retention. Finally, educators will receive ongoing, need-based, targeted professional learning 
opportunities to support them in improving their practice to better meet the needs of scholars. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Educators and paraprofessionals receive ongoing, need-based, targeted professional learning support from lead 
teachers and administrators aimed at aligning instruction with the CCSS and Instructional Shifts. Administrators 
attend monthly professional learning opportunities offered by the district, which provide support with implementing 
the most current pedagogical practices aligned to the CCSS. When school wide priorities are identified, such as 
creating Common Core aligned units and assessments, school wide professional learning opportunities are provided. 
The principal prioritizes funds to provide all staff members with various opportunities throughout the year to attend 
workshops both in and out of the building to promote professional growth.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Upon registration, families are invited to attend informational sessions to orient families and scholars to the school. 
They are also provided with a school handbook which outlines the school’s expectations and resources that are 
available to them. Families are encouraged to accompany their child the first day of school. Pre-school scholars also 
stay in school half-day for the first two days until they are mainstreamed into a full day of school. Educators serving 
pre-school scholars plan Common Core aligned cross-curricular units of study in Professional Learning Teams in 
collaboration with the kindergarten team. Educators also engage in professional learning opportunities throughout 
the school year to support improved teaching practices and scholar outcomes across content areas. Families are 
encouraged to become active participants in their child’s development and education. Our school has an open door 
policy, which encourages families to visit classrooms and meet with educators to discuss their child's progress. During 
these visits families are given strategies and suggestions that will help them support their child at home. Early 
intervention services are also offered to scholars who are deemed at risk. Families are invited to attend Meet the 
Teacher Night in September, and Parent Teacher Conferences in November, March and May. Parent participation is 
also encouraged throughout the year with various classroom celebrations and activities. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
WAVE Prep will continue to contract a data specialist to support them in collecting, analyzing and more effectively 
and efficiently using data to drive planning and instruction. End-of-year ELA and mathematics data for the 2017-2018 
school year was put in a school wide database. This data will be distributed to scholars' new teachers for the 2018-
2019 school year to support them in planning targeted, differentiated instruction. Educators will continue to enter 
assessment results in the database throughout the year in all subjects in order for the school to more efficiently and 
effectively monitor scholar progress and use data to drive instructional decisions.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

Educators will meet with grade leaders during the first week of school to review and revise assessment calendars for 
the 2018-2019 school year. This will ensure that all content is taught and assessed. Mid and end-of-unit assessments 
as well as performance tasks for interdisciplinary ELA units will be revised on an ongoing basis based on educator 
feedback from the previous school year. Educators will also work collaboratively during professional learning team 
meetings to plan formative assessments to check for scholar understanding throughout instruction. In mathematics, 
educators will use Go Math end-of-unit assessments and performance task to monitor scholar progress, reteaching 
small groups based on need when necessary. Grade leaders will work alongside the testing coordinator to provide 
educators with ongoing professional learning opportunities focused on effectively administering, analyzing, and using 
assessment data to drive instruction and reflect on teacher practice. The testing coordinator will also guide the 
“School Local Measures Committee” in selecting and administering assessments at the city and state level. This 
committee of educators is selected by a vote and works with administrators to review the assessment options and 
growth measures and finalizing selections. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual

identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy 
is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. WAVE Preparatory 
Elementary School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating 
and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

WAVE Preparatory Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
The language instruction education program at WAVE Prep funded under Title III is designed to 
help ELL scholars attain English proficiency and meet the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  The program supplements the school's free standing ENL program.  This Title III 
program will help prepare ELLs for the ELA and NYSESLAT assessments by providing them 
with fundamental literacy skills and important academic language.  
School data reveals that many of our ELL scholars are not keeping pace with their English 
dominant peers on benchmark assessments in both ELA and mathematics.  When 
reviewing NYSESLAT results, the majority of our ELL scholars consistently score better in 
listening and speaking, than in reading and writing sections of the exam. We believe that this 
disparity is primarily due to our scholars acquiring basic interpersonal communication skills at a 
much faster rate than cognitive academic language.  
In an effort to move our scholars towards meeting Common Core Learning Standards and 
improving in reading and writing, we will provide scholars with additional support services 
during morning and after school programs, specifically tailored to meeting their needs. 
Selected ELLs in grades 1-5 will participate in these supplemental programs from December to 
May. Morning support will be offered Monday through Thursday from 7:20AM-8:15AM. 
Afternoon support will be offered Wednesday and Thursdays from 2:40PM-4:00PM. 
Scholars will be strategically placed in groups depending on their English proficiency level and 
grade. Targeted groups will include newcomers, scholars far below grade level, and scholars 
approaching grade level standards. While some scholars will receive support in speaking, 
listening and early literacy skills, others will receive support preparing for NYS assessments 
including the ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT. Supplemental services will be delivered in English 
by 4 certified ENL/bilingual educators and two content area educators. One resource educators 
will use to support scholars is Cornerstone English Language Learning System, a research-based 
language acquisition curriculum designed to meet the needs of English language learners. The 
Cornerstone English Language Learning System curriculum is founded on scientifically based 
research and state standards. Each unit of study was developed to incorporate practices proved to 
be effective.  Cornerstone accelerates vocabulary acquisition, develops transferable language 
skills and provides an easy-to-use road map to academic success in language proficiency. Ready 
Assessment Preparation guides will also be used to support ELLs in grade 3 through 5 in 
preparing for the NYS ELA and Mathematics exams in addition to the NYSESLAT. Finally, 
trained educators will use Fountas & Pinnell Literacy Intervention to support small groups of 
scholars with early literacy skills and comprehension.  
All program notifications will be distributed to parents at least three weeks in advance in parents' 
preferred languages to provide adequate time to follow up with parents to ensure participation. 
Attendance spreadsheets will be collected by supervising administrator or a daily basis and 
maintained by the supervising administrator. Outreach will be made to the families of scholars 
whose attendance is inconsistent in the parents' preferred language to promote consistent 
participation.

Begin description here:            
In order to promote academic excellence and quality instruction for ELLs, ENL specialists will 
deliver professional learning opportunities for educators: 
• Tools and Strategies for making the Common Core Learning Standards accessible for ELL 
Scholars – Through ongoing professional development led by ENL instructional coaches, 
educators will learn to meet the needs of ELL scholars at various levels of language acquisition 
within the Common Core classroom. They will also engage in implementing strategies to 
scaffold the instruction of rigorous tasks in literacy and mathematics to meet the needs of ELL 
scholars. Educators will learn how to front load vocabulary using total physical response, and 
pictures to help make content more accessible. They will also design tasks/rubrics aligned to 
the  Common Core Standards that allow for ongoing assessment throughout the unit. Finally, 
educators will work with ENL instructional coaches to analyze ELL scholar data from mid-unit 
CFUs and end-of-unit assessments to determine necessary next steps. This professional 
development takes place weekly during ENL Committee meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:40 PM - 4:00 PM.  
• Differentiation  – This series of workshops will focus on providing educators with a variety of 
instructional methodologies to meet the needs of all scholars including English language 
learners. Included in these workshops will be multi-modality teaching approaches, ways to 
scaffold instruction, and other approaches that help make learning more accessible for ELL 
scholars. Additionally, we will expose educators to various co-teaching models in order to 
maximize instruction within the school community. This series of workshops will take place for 
three consecutive Wednesdays from 2:40 PM to 4:00 PM. The tentative dates for these 
workshops are December 5, 12 and 19.   
•The SIOP Model - ENL instructional coaches will lead a full-day professional development 
session aimed at helping the educators create quality lesson plans using the SIOP Model, which 
directly supports ELL scholars by including a language and content objective in every lesson. 
Educators will be guided through the process of revising and creating actual lesson plans to 
include a language objective so they are more beneficial for their ELL populations. The 
educators working closely with ELL population will receive coverage for this professional 
learning opportunity scheduled for November 12.    
All agendas will be maintained in the 'Professional Learning Opportunities' binder in the 
Principal's office. Attendance is recorded on the meeting's agenda.

Begin description here:            
Parent engagement will support the academic, social and emotional growth of ELL scholars. As 
required under Title I and Title III, a parent meeting will be held before the end of October 
outlining the WAVE Prep Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) and the School-Parent Compact. 
Both documents are distributed in English and in the native language of parents.      
WAVE Prep will continue to fund a full-time Parent Coordinator who is responsible for 
promoting parent engagement and addressing parent questions and concerns.  A bilingual Pupil 
Accountant Secretary supports this work by making outreach to parents regarding upcoming 
workshops and learning opportunities for parents.  
Planned Workshops and Training Opportunities will take place on the second Wednesday of 
every month. The hour long workshops will take place during after school hours. 
Workshops will be facilitated our ENL Coordinator and qualified school staff. 
These workshops include: 
Helping your Child with Reading provided by ENL Coordinator and classroom teachers 
(10/10/18) 
Supporting your Child's Mathematics Development provided by 
ENL Coordinator and classroom teachers (11/14/18) 
Healthy Habits and Healthy Eating provided by Physical Education teacher(12/12/18) 
 Increase parent understanding of CCLS standards and assessments  provided by 
ENL Coordinator and classroom teachers (1/15/19) 
Other tentative workshops and opportunities include: 
• Parental involvement in instructional initiatives including a Title III meeting  
• Parent literacy development 
• Support for increased parent participation on the School Leadership Team and subcommittees 
(year round provided by School Leadership Team, PTA, Family Coordinators and Parent 
Coordinator). 
• Community resource support (career development, health, social services, etc.) by school social 
worker. 
• Create and stock a lending library with parenting and intervention materials, learning aids and 
other resources of interest to parents in multiple languages (year round provided by Parent 
Coordinator and educators). 
• Provide group sessions for parents as an opportunity to share common experiences, gain 
emotional support, learn practical parenting and problem solving skills from other members that 
is inclusive  of ELL parents with translation available (Minimum of three to four times a year 
provided by Parent Coordinator). 
• Provide individual sessions to meet with ENL educators to inform parents of current ENL 
Proficiency Levels and strategies that can be implemented at home to help with scholar's English 
language acquisition (Ongoing throughout the school year).  
• Continue the circulation of the Parent Coordinator Newsletter/Calendar in English and Spanish 
(monthly provided by Parent Coordinator) 
•Make outreach to adult education programs to provide services for ENL parents. 
All agendas will be maintained in the 'Parent Involvement' binder in the principal's office. 
Attendance is recorded on the meeting's agenda. Invitations will be distributed to parents at least 
three weeks in advance in parents' preferred languages to ensure participation. Bilingual staff 
members will be present to deliver workshops and provide information to families in the home 
language. In additional, when needed the school will utilize the DOE's Language & Translation

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The formative assessment assessment tools that our school uses to guide instruction for ELLs are Fountas and Pinnell, teacher 
created reading and writing assessments, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and Math and ELA State Assessment.  A school wide data 
collection system, Data Corp, is used to input, gather and analyze performance on these assessments. This data reveals 
relevant information regarding ELL progress in literacy, in areas such as concepts of print, decoding, fluency and 
comprehension and math skills.  We also use results from these assessments  to provide additional AIS services through 
targeted, intensive small group instruction. The school wide inquiry team meets with ENL service provider to analyze results of 
assessments, focusing on school wide trends and implications for school wide instruction for ELLs.  
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Self-contained ENL classes have been strategically added on three grades to support our ELL population. Additionally, ENL 
service providers analyze results from the NYSESLAT and pull out small groups of scholars accordingly to provide 
intensive intervention and support in the four modalities (reading, writing, listening and speaking) using the Fountas and 
Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System. ENL service providers also support ELLs of all proficiency levels by pushing into 
classrooms to scaffold content through integrated teaching. Differentiated groups of ELL students are created based on 
reading levels, NYSESLAT results, and teacher observations. The ENL coach provides classroom teachers with professional 
learning opportunities to provide them with differentiation strategies, scaffolding, and best practices. Additionally the ENL 
coach works with Instructional coaches to provide feedback on how to make the content accessible for ELL students based on 
proficiency levels.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs on a continuous basis using interim assessments in reading, writing, and 
math as well interim assessments created by the ENL teachers. To evaluate the success of our programs in reading we use 
Fountas and Pinnell periodic assessments and school-wide performance tasks. In writing, we use weekly reading response 
pieces as well as school-wide performance tasks. Go Math unit assessments are used to evaluate the progress of ELLs in math. 
Formative data is collected by teachers on a daily basis to inform instruction and create groups to support struggling students, 
including ELLs with differentiated materials and scaffolding strategies. All assessments are aligned to the CCLS and monitor 
ELLs progress towards meeting these standards. In addition, we will use the ELL Periodic Assessment as a baseline assessment 
and as a benchmark to measure student language development. We also closely examine the NYSESLAT results to measure 
students AYP. We look for patterns and trends in scale scores across the grades and proficiency levels. If individual students or 
groups of students are not making significant progress, we evaluate their circumstances as well as our instructional programs 
for ELLs and make the necessary adjustments to better meet their needs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

At the beginning of the school year the Instructional Cabinet, including the ENL coordinator and the AP of ELLs, meet to 
analyze NYSESLAT results and make strategic scheduling decisions based on student need. Moreover, ENL service providers 
create schedules to meet the needs of entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding ELLs and plan lessons 
geared towards individual groups areas of need (reading, writing, speaking, listening). The Instructional Cabinet will also meet 
with ENL service providers and self-contained ENL classroom teachers after administering benchmark assessments (F&P and 
ELL Period Assessment) to assess student growth, evaluate the effectiveness of the instructional programming, and make any 
necessary changes. ENL teachers will also meet weekly with the ENL coordinator, instructional coaches, or the AP of 
ELLs during Professional Learning Team meetings to analyze data collected through the online portal Dropbox provided by 
service provider Data Corp. In order to identify students who require additional support through small group intervention. ENL 
teachers work collaboratively with classroom teachers in order to provide targeted instruction using data collected from 
summative assessments.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Classroom teachers collect data and monitor ongoing progress using formative assessments, such as Fountas and Pinnell 
progress monitoring, unit assessments, and performance tasks, to identify at risk students. As with the rest of the school’s 
population our ELL students are administered baseline assessments to determine whether they are a Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 
RTI student. Teachers and the ENL service coordinator then collaborate with Instructional Cabinet members to analyze data 
and determine which level of support is needed to ensure academic success for all scholars. Once a determination is made, the 
instructional plan is devised for each Tier and AIS recommendations are implemented. Additionally, a plan is also devised for 
our entering and emerging students using RTI. Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 
instructional level. If the analysis of assessment data reveals that students are below or far below grade level standards, the 
students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 in order to receive more targeted and intensive academic support, in addition to core 
instruction.This extra support occurs both in the classroom through push-in AIS services as well as in separate settings with 
instruction focused on specific learning targets.  Assessment of progress monitoring within the RTI program consists of Teacher 
Teams looking at student work  in order to recognize trends and gaps in learning and to modify the instruction to address 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

those learning gaps. The formative assessments are in the forms of written assignments, teacher-student conferences, and 
oral presentations.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our data indicates that ELL students scored better on the Listening and Speaking parts of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT 
assessments than on the Reading and Writing sections.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL coordinator works with grade level instructional coaches to support classroom teachers in analyzing and interpreting 
data from unit reading and writing assessments as well as Fountas & Pinnell benchmark assessments. The School Wide Inquiry 
Team also meets at the beginning of the school year to analyze and interpret the RLAT report, discuss proficiency levels, and 
identify areas of strength and weaknesses within the four modalities and make program adjustments. Targeted professional 
learning opportunities are also planned for teachers based of ELLs based on needs assessments.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The school has made strategic hiring decisions in order to better service our English language learners. Three dually 
licensed ENL teachers teach self-contained classes in kindergarten, second and third grades, the grades with the 
highest concentration of ELLs. ELLs in these classes are grouped heterogeneously and classroom teachers use ENL 
strategies to scaffold and differentiate instruction. An out of classroom ENL provider services ELLs in the other grades 
and classes by pushing into classrooms for integrated instruction and pulling groups of students out of classrooms for 
standalone ENL instruction. Students are grouped both heterogeneously by grade band and homogeneously by 
proficiency level, depending on the grade and the academic and language needs of the students. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

At this time our school does not have a TBE program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At this time our school does not have a DL program.    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The ENL service coordinator works with the School Wide Inquiry Team to analyze RLAT data at the beginning of the school year 
to determine the needs of the school's ELL population and create a schedule to accommodate the mandated number of 
instructional minutes for students at each proficiency level. A combination of self-contained ELL classes, integrate ELA/ENL 
instruction, and standalone ENL instruction are used to support ELLs at varying proficiency levels. The ENL service 
provider meets with classroom teachers weekly to coordinate integrated instruction and ensure that standalone instruction 
does not interfere with regular classroom instruction. The ENL service provider supports classroom teachers through 
integrated ELA instruction using  targeted ENL strategies and scaffolds. Depending on the makeup of each grade, some ELLs 
are inter-classed during these periods to provide additional support. Whenever possible, the ENL service provider schedules

standalone services strategically, pulling entering and emerging ELLs from various classes in sequential grade bands to provide 
services.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In order to make content comprehensible for ELLs and foster language development, educators work with the ENL coordinator 
to plan and implement differentiated integrated instruction to meet the needs of ELLs in the classroom. Besides pushing into 
classrooms to support content learning, the ENL coordinator meets with classroom teachers on a weekly basis during 
professional learning team meetings to develop language objectives for each lesson that support the Common Core based 
content objectives being taught.  Although all instruction is conducted in English, many of our staff members are bilingual and 
are encouraged to help support ELLs by providing background knowledge in the native language prior to introducing a new 
unit. Educators are trained to use various ENL strategies and scaffolds to make content comprehensible and foster language 
development. For instance, educators use cognates to help support ELLs with vocabulary development and comprehension in 
the classroom. Educators also use Total Physical Response (TPR), visual aids, realia, manipulatives, and graphic organizers or 
Thinking Maps to learning for ELLs. Educators differentiate instruction for ELLs through small group instruction, tiered-
questioning, group or partner work, and personalized word walls, dictionaries, or sentence starters. The Go Math program also 
provides suggestions for differentiation which educators are encouraged to utilize throughout mathematics instruction.           
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We do not evaluate students in their native language. However, Spanish-speaking ELLs are administered the Spanish LAB at the 
same time as the NYSITELL.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 a. A similar model is used with SIFE students as is used for beginner/entering ELL, with additional supports and scaffolds 
provided. SIFE students receive additional small group instruction and intervention services that include a modified version of 
Fundations to provide basic foundational literacy skills.  ENL teachers provide these students with targeted instruction geared 
at building on whatever prior knowledge they may come with, academic or cultural. When possible, ENL teachers use 
students' home language to support their acquisition of English. In addition, these students are encouraged to participate in 
intervention programs provided before and/or after school as well as during summer school.  
b. A similar model is used with Newcomer ELL students as is used for beginner/entering ELLs, with additional supports and 
scaffolds provided. Newcomer ELLs participate in a "Lunch and Learn" twice a week in which they meet with an ENL teacher 
and English speaking students to participate in games and fun activities that promote social language development and help 
acclimate them to the school environment. They are also encouraged to participate in intervention programs provided before 
and/or after school.   
c. The ENL coordinator and classroom teachers review benchmark assessment data and past NYSESLAT results to evaluate 
each student's academic progress. If a particular student is not making adequate progress, the ENL coordinator and classroom 
teachers work together to determine what other factors may be affecting the child. An intervention plan is created and if 
needed an evaluation for special education services may be requested.  
d. We do not have any long-term ELLs.  
e. Former ELLs continue to receive support along with advanced ELLs as long as needed.  They continue to receive testing 
accomodations for two years after scoring proficient on the NYSESLAT. Educators are made aware of the former ELLs in their 
classrooms and are supported in using scaffolding strategies to make learning more accessible for them.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

Teachers use a variety of instructional strategies and grade-level materials to support ELL students in the classroom. ENL 
teachers use the common core aligned program Cornerstone which accelerates English language development. The 
Cornerstone program intergrates four modalities of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Cornerstone is designed by grade 
level and therefore age appropiate. Additionally, teachers front load important vocabulary by introducing words with visuals 
and total physical response prior to starting a new unit or text. They also utilize instructional techniques such as modeling, 
bridging, conceptualization, schema building, text representation, and meta-cognitive development.  Using a thematic 
approach, students are exposed to all areas of literacy: reading, writing, listening and speaking.  In addition, the five ENL 
approaches are employed, including Cooperative Learning, The Natural Approach, Total Physical Response, The Language 
Experience Approach, and the Whole Language Approach.  For students at the Entering and Emerging proficiency level, 
instruction focuses on Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS).  The focus shifts to Cognitive Academic Language 
Proficiency (CALP) as students reach the Transitioning and Commanding profiency level of language develpoment. Technology 
is also used to support  ELLs through the use of SMART BOARDS, laptops, computers, and ipads to provide ELL students with 
access to programs that support language development, and intergrate content. ELLs with disabilities  are provided 
diffrentiated reading instruction using the Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention program. Additionally, ELL-SWDs 
whose IEP mandates ENL instruction are serviced just as other ELLs through intergrated and stand alone services by the ENL 
coordinator. If the parents of ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction choose to remain in our school, a bilingual 
one-on-one paraprofessional is provided to help support their language needs in the special education setting listed in their 
IEP.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We strive to constantly reevaluate our students' needs in order to place them in the least restrictive setting where they can be 
successful. Many of our students with IEPs, including ELLs, are interclassed in general education classrooms during certain 
periods of the day depending on ability and need. Entering and Emerging ELL-SWDs are pulled out for small group ENL 
instruction with other ELL students that do not have special needs.  Transitioning and Expanding ELL-SWDs are often 
interclassed during the ELA block to receive integrated instruction in reading and writing. Some of our self-contained special 
education teachers are also dually certified or in the process of obtaining ENL certification, which allows them to also use ENL 
strategies in their own classrooms to support learning. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Baseline, formative, and summative assessments are used to group ELL students according to their learning needs across all 
subject areas. The ENL coordinator works in collaboration with classroom teachers to provide differentiated instruction and 
targeted small group instruction during the school day as well as before and after school. While all instruction is provided in 
English, bilingual ENL providers may use students' home language to provide support when appropriate.  In addition, during 
planning sessions the ENL coordinator meets with classroom teachers to discuss different strategies that will support the 
progress of ELL students in their classes. Social studies and science are taught in cross-curricular units with ELA. The ENL 
coordinator often pushes in during the ELA block to help support ELLs through small group instruction. She also coordinates 
with classroom teachers so that standalone ENL lessons support the learning in the classroom. Small groups of students, 
including ELLs, are also supported through AIS using the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System. During 
mathematics instruction educators break off into groups often working with ELLs or other struggling learners to 
provide support and scaffold instruction using Go Math resources such as the Tier II Strategic Intervention Pack, the Intensive 
Skills Intervention Pack, and the ELL Activities Pack. Educators also use flexible grouping and paired or small group reading or 
math activities to help support ELLs. Newcomer ELLs are provided additional intervention services during a language academy 
that takes place after school. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our ELA State Assessment data indicates that only 6% of ELLs  in grades 3-5 are proficient in reading and 15% are proficient in 
math.  Fountas and Pinnell end of year data indicates that only 20% of ELLs are performing on or above grade level in reading. 
End of the year GoMath benchmark assessment data indicates that 46% of ELLs school wide are performing on or above grade 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

level. 
 
After analyzing school wide ELL data during a school wide inquiry team meeting, the Instructional Cabinet made the strategic 
decision to staff three self-contained ENL classrooms with dually certified teachers. These teachers use ENL strategies to 
scaffold and differentiate instruction to support the needs of their ELLs. NYSESLAT data as well as Fountas and Pinnell reading 
data, showed that our first grade ELLs made the least improvement in reading and writing. As such, this year, our ENL service 
provider and AIS provider are targeting the first grade ENL classroom by providing additional small group reading and writing 
intervention four times per week. First grade ELLs, as well as some second grade ELLs, will also be invited to an ENL Morning 
Language Academy to further support their development across the four modalities. Finally, the school will support ELLs in 
grades 3-5 by providing ELA and mathematics support aligned to the state assessment during an after school program. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
We do not have any programs/services that will be discontinued.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs receive daily guided reading support and ENL services. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are included in reading and math 
after school academies. Entering and Emerging ELLs, including newcomers, are provided additional services related to their 
language needs during an after school language academy.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A variety of instructional materials are used to support the learning of ELLs.  All classroom are equipped with SMARTBOARD 
technology, which allows interactive learning to take place. Additionally, every grade has access to Ipads and laptops which 
allow teachers to differentiate instruction in an engaging way to meet the needs of all learners. The school also purchased 
Pearson's Cornerstone English Learning System and Newcomer Program which are used by ENL service providers to further 
support the needs of ELLs. Audio books, picture libraries, and manipulatives are made readily available to provide scaffolding 
and support for ELLs when needed.  Differentiated texts are used for guided reading and content instruction. Go Math ELL 
supports, manipulatives, and home language resources are used to support ELLs Mathematics needs.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Currently, our school only has an ENL program. Students have access to native language support in the form of books, 
bilingual dictionaries, and bilingual teachers and language paraprofessionals. We also offer Spanish to all students as an 
elective. At this time, we do not have a TBE or Dual Language program at our school. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The instructional support and materials are age appropriate as they consider the child's development as a whole. The push-in 
model ensures that students do not miss key concepts that are taught. Interest surveys and interviews with students and 
parents ensure that resources are of interest while meeting the needs as outlined by data. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All parents of entering kindergarten students as well as any newly enrolled ELL students are invited for an orientation in the 
summer, at which time services for ELLs are discussed.  The ENL coordinator, who is one of the first people to interact with 
newly enrolled ELLs, strategically schedules herself to meet with newly enrolled ELLs in order to ensure smooth transition. She 
also plans hands-on oral language development activities that include tours of the school building and relevant language 
necessary to communicate basic needs. Our Pupil Accounting Secretary, who was previously our family work, partners with our 
Parent Coordinator to provide information to parents regarding curriculum, support services, ENL services and overall school 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

systems to acclimate families and help them understand the many resources we have to offer. Any ELL students that appear to 
be struggling with the transition are provided with at-risk counseling by the social worker. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do no currently offer any language 
electives.                                                                                                                                                                     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In August, teachers will receive professional development led by the ENL coordinator and and Instructional Coaches to support 
them in differentiating instruction aligned to the curriculum to meet the needs of all learners, including ELLs. Educators will 
also receive training on utilizing Thinking Maps in their classrooms, a crucial scaffolding tool that supports learning for ELLs by 
providing them with a visual representation of ideas and concepts. In September,Instructional Coaches and ENL 
coordinator  will provide targeted professional development centered around the Danielson Framework for effective teaching, 
measuring student learning, and using performance tasks to assess and support subgroups including ELLs. In the beginning of 
the school year, professional learning teams will look closely at ELL literacy data through the inquiry process including Fountas 
and Pinnell scores, reading pre-assessments, and the beginning of the year quick write to identify common trends and develop 
implications for teaching. In addition, all staff members will attend a mandatory professional development intended to help 
educators understand the language development stages that ELLs go through and how to support ELLs at the different 
proficiency levels. Educators will be exposed to various strategies for scaffolding and differentiating instruction to make 
content comprehensible for ELLs. They will also be introduced to the SIOP model and practice creating language objectives for 
current units of study. In addition to the numerous opportunities for professional developed offered school-wide, each grade 
team will meet weekly for two periods with a coach and ENL coordinator to analyze data and plan future instruction, paying 
special attention to meeting the needs of subgroups including ELLs. The ENL coordinator will also be available to meet with 
educators before and after school to provide additional guidance in supporting ELLs in the mainstream classroom. The ENL 
coordinator will attend staff development along with other coaches and colleagues to stay current with the shifts and changes 
of the DOE. They will also attend ENL professional development meetings provided by the DOE and, when applicable, share 
their learning by turn-keying information to their colleagues. The ENL coordinator will be responsible for providing additional 
support to teachers of ELLs in language acquisition approaches, strategies for differentiating and scaffolding instruction, and 
questioning techniques. ENL teachers will also participate in a book study focused on best practices for supporting ELLs. Other 
personnel, such as paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, secretaries, and 
parent coordinators are invited to attend all school wide professional development and are provided direct support by the ENL 
coordinator whenever needed.  
Our ENL coordinator, attends monthly professional development sessions provided by the Queens South BFSC. Some of the 
professional development sessions that our ENL coordinator attend include, analyzing data to further assist ELL’s at various 
levels, using RTI to support struggling ELLs, implementing the Common Core Standards in the ENL classroom, preparing 
students for the newly aligned NYSESLAT, developing questioning and discussion techniques suited for ELLs, and the use of 
Depth of Knowledge. In addition, the ENL coordinator actively participate in Professional Learning Teams which meet  at least 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

twice per week during which various professional activities are planned and executed. Teachers receive support in order to 
implement strategies to make content accessible to all ELL learners by discussing scaffolds, entry points, differentiation and 
modifications. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
To support our staff in assisting our ELLs in transitioning from elementary to middle school we offer professional development 
on the academic, social, and emotional growth differences between elementary and middle school students, as well as on 
ways to develop independence and responsibility in preparation for middle school. Our advisory program benefits our students 
as well as our staff in learning and sharing about the challenges facing students in and outside of school at the middle school 
age level. Professional Development on the Common Core Learning Standards also prepares our staff to best prepare our 
students for the transition to the next grade level. Additionally, ENL coordinators collaborate with teachers in order to analyze 
data using school wide assessments in order to identify ELLs in need of RTI so that they can achieve the Common Core Learning 
Standards and be prepared for middle school. Our school’s guidance counselor will attend Professional Development sessions 
which will target ELLs transitioning to middle school and how to meet emotionally meet the needs of our transitioning 
students. In addition, our school will create a partnership with a local middle school to assist ELL students with the transition 
into middle school. Through this partnership our ELL students will have opportunities to visit the school and meet with middle 
school teachers and guidance counselors in order to understand expectations, lessen concerns, and build the confidence of our 
ELL students.   
  
Our school plans on meeting the mandated professional development hours through by providing in-house and external 
opportunities. The school will take advantage of the professional development time provided on Monday afternoons by 
offering workshops that focus on meeting the needs of ELLs by using strategies to make content comprehensible. Teachers will 
also receive training on best practices for co-teaching with an ENL teacher and integrating language and content instruction. 
Additionally, teachers will engage in targeted professional development during professional learning team meetings led by 
instructional coaches and ENL coordinator. Such PD's include, Expeditionary Learning, differentiation strategies, Depth of 
Knowledge, Questioning skills with special focus of component 3b in Danielson, UBD, and strategies to help ELLs achieve the 
Common Core Learning  Standards. Records of trainings are maintained in the school's Professional Development Binder.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In order to provide ELL parents with annual individual meetings, the ENL coordinators works with the Parent Coordinator to 
make outreach in person, by phone, and through written correspondence. Individual meetings are set up during school hours, 
before and after school, and Tuesday afternoons during scheduled Parent Engagement time. Every attempt is made to 
accommodate parents in meeting at a time that is most convenient for them.  When possible meetings are conducted in the 
parent's preferred language.  If families speak a language other than the languages readily available to be translated then the 
school uses the Department of Education over-the-phone interpretation service is used.  All attendance records are 
maintained in the Parent Communication binders. During these meetings, the goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessments results, and language development needs in all content areas are discussed with 
parents of ELLs. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
 Our school offers a wide range of opportunities for parent engagement. (PTA), “Meet the Teacher Night”, Parent-Conferences, 
liaison with our Parent Coordinator, school trips and family activities and monthly parent information sessions. Our DOE Web 
Site supports our high level of parent involvement. Annual Learning Environment Survey data confirms that our parents are

actively involved in all aspects of our school community. Parents and guardians of ELLs are involved in the above and an annual 
ELL Parent Outreach and Information session which is held in the fall of each year. Due to the importance of parent 
involvement, the Principal and Assistant Principals take an active role in planning and conducting activities. All parents, 
including those of our ELL population are invited to participate in all of our school activities such as "Dads Bring Your Child to 
School Breakfast", "Monthly Academic and Behavioral Awards Ceremonies", "End of The Year Awards".  
  
Parents are encouraged to become active participants of the school community. Parents are invited to attend workshops that 
will help them support their children. All workshops have translators present. Materials are presented in the home language as 
well. Parents learn different strategies to support their children at home and are updated on a weekly, if not daily basis 
regarding the academic and behavioral progress of their children. We also have an open-door policy at our school and invite 
parents to visit classrooms to observe instructional best practices that may be used to support their children at home. In 
addition, parents volunteer their time to help with trips, classroom projects, and special events. Opportunities for parent 
engagement include “Meet the Teacher Night”, "Dads Bring Your Child to School", "Parent Teacher Conferences", "Academic 
and Behavioral Awards Ceremonies",  "End of The Year Merit Awards", “Dance Festival”, Parent Association (PA) meetings, 
School Leadership Team meetings, and parent workshops. Furthermore, our school has an open door policy in which parents 
can come and observe classroom instruction and receive strategies to help their child at home. Our school Parent Coordinator 
is the direct liaison between parents and the school in order to make parents aware of all opportunities for parent 
engagement. Our Principal arranges for translation services to be available on days such as "Meet the Teacher Night" and 
"Parent-Teacher conference" afternoon and night by various staff members. In the event that staff members are unable to 
communicate with parents, the Department of Educations over-the-phone translation services are used. While we do have 
several partnerships with agencies and Community Based Organizations to support our overall school community and student 
achievement efforts, we do not currently have any such partnerships specifically devoted to providing workshops or services to 
ELL parents. We build strong partnerships and open lines of communication and mutual respect and trust with our parents and 
actively seek their input on school matters through the SLT and the PA to evaluate all parent needs. We conduct informal 
surveys during the year and we also analyze the results of our Annual Learning Environment Survey to determine the needs of 
the parents. After analyzing various parent inputs, we modify our methods and plans as needed. Each of our parental 
involvement activities is a result of what we determine are the wants and needs of our parent community. Therefore, the 
activities are designed with the assistance of the PA and School Leadership Team to meet those wants and needs. Our 
informational sessions always include a question and answer session and we elicit feedback via e-mail or telephone 
throughout the school year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gemma Ferguson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to asses our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs begin 
with ATS reports such as the RHLA (disaggregated home language report) and RCPL identifying written and oral 
languages spoken at home. In addition, we distribute the Preferred Language Form provided by the Department 
of Education three times per year to all parents. Their language preferences are documented on a spreadsheet 
that is updated periodically. When we have new students admitted to our school, the parents are provided with 
the form and their preferences are indicated on the spreadsheet. We have also identified members of our school 
community who are able to communicate orally to parents when needed to support their understanding. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Chancellors Regulation A-663 requires that schools provide timely translation and distribution of critical 
communications into the covered languages including registration and selection, standards and performance, conduct 
and discipline, safety and health, placement in any special education, English language learner or non-standard 
academic program and transfers and discharges. We are in compliance with this requirement using our translators 
and DOE supplied translation services.  In order to ensure that parents are aware of their right to receive critical 
communication in their preferred language the school displays translated signage throughout the school, provide 
parents with I Speak Cards and provide them with a Parents Guide to Language Access during parent engagements to 
ensure that parents receive information in their language.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school will gather feedback about the quality and availability of services through school-created parent surveys. 
These surveys will be distributed during school-wide meetings such as meet the teacher and parent teacher 
conferences.
