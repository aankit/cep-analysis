Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement: Our mission is to cultivate empowered leaders and bold-thinkers that innovate solutions to 
problems using 21st century skills. 

We achieve this through project-based, STEAM-focused instruction in a safe, supportive and challenging environment 
that encourages students to be more than consumers but creators.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Highland Park Community School (HPCS) is located in the Cypress Hills area of East New York, on the border of 
Brooklyn and Queens. We are a new school that opened with grade 6 in Fall 2014. We will have 6th, 7th and 8th grade 
for the 2018-2019 school year. We currently serve 344 students. 98% of our students identify as Latino or of African 
descent, 35% of our students are English Language Learners (ELLs), and 21% of our students are identified as Students 
with Disabilities (SWDs). 

We are located in a residential neighborhood where families are clear that they want their young people to get a 
great education as access to avoiding poverty. We care about our neighbors, hard-working folks who want to support 
a thriving community. East New York has been a community neglected from the capital improvement projects and 
development that central Brooklyn has experienced in the last decade. We are committed to contributing to our 
community, one that houses the largest number of community gardens in Brooklyn with a plethora of local businesses 
on Fulton Street, Liberty and Jamaica Avenues to name a few. 

Our purpose is to disrupt any negative trajectories and to have students and caregivers demonstrate that school is 
more than a place one shows up daily but an opportunity to transform your future. It is a space that empowers you to 
dream, create a plan for that dream, execute it, fail and revise that plan and implement it again. 

We are a project-based school where each grade theme connects to a culminating year-end project.... 

 

Partnerships : We have carefully chosen collaborations and partnerships that support our vision and mission based in 
S.T.E.A.M. = STEM + Arts. They are: 

Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation (CHLDC) offers an array of after school programming for students such 
as various performing and visual arts programming and computer programming and technology classes. They have 
created a service-learning project based upon our 90-day Fresh Food Access project for 6th graders from our school as 
well as IS 171. They also offer the Middle School Success Center which mentors students on how to navigate the high 
school application process and prepare for college.

The SWT Life is a leadership development program that enables students to tap into their super powers to make a 
project a reality to improve school culture. 

IBM provides leadership mentors, thought partners, curricula and other resources for our school as we grow. 

PTECH as the first 9-14 school in the country giving high school students access to an Associates degree in Computer 
Information Systems or Electromechanical Engineering, is an excellent source of mentors, staff professional 
development, shared resources and distributed leadership models. 

MSQI provides support to help us improve our literacy instruction across all content areas. 

Urban Advantage provides support for Science educators to create a dynamic curriculum that involves hands on 
applications of science concepts. 

 

In 8th grade students take varying electives continuing from their previous years and take 4 regents exams: Living 
Environment, Algebra, U.S. History, ELA. All 6th graders take Music, Art, Health and Physical Education. In every 
aspect of our school you will find a young person leading or training to lead such as Principal 4 A Day, Morning 
Meeting, Advisory and Student-As-Teacher. The school has been successful in using technology to support all learners 
and foster 21st century learning. The school has also been successful by having “town hall” styled Morning Meetings 
where the school community connects and discusses issues important to us. Every Friday students are celebrated for 
keeping it R.E.A.L (Resilience, Empathy, Accountability and Leadership). It is also a space where students can be 
motivated, challenged, and inspired to start each day with a positive attitude. 

 

 

As a new public middle school, we were able to bring in staff members that believe in our mission and goals and 
partners that can support us in achieving it. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The achievement gap is defined as “the difference between low income and minority students compared to that of 
their peers on standardized test“ (education.com). This is a challenge that we face here at HPCS since our student 
enrollment includes a high amount of minorities and high poverty students with varying levels of need. Our African-
American and LatinX students are on average trailing behind their white peers by more than 20 points. We are faced 
with the challenge of educating students that are not on grade level in reading and mathematics as a result of living in 
impoverished areas. We are continually discussing as a school community new ways and opportunities for parents to 
become more involved in our school and for us to support them with social services. For example we donate a 
significant amount of uniforms, fully stocked book bags, footwear and coats to students in need. In addition, we hold 
bi-annual awards ceremonies and assemblies that display our student’s talents and compliment the increased 
outreach efforts.  

We also have an increased focus on Social Emotional Learning in the classroom and through after-school 
programming.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the last school year we went from "Fair" to "Good" in Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Strong Family 
and Community Ties. How have we accomplished this? 

Rigorous Instruction: we were able to achieve this through grouping students based on need. All teachers have time 
to meet with their grade partners daily, allowing them to include scaffolds for various learners, share resources and 
push each others ideas and bring the strengths of different educators to the conversation. This also increases 
accountability with each other. 

Supportive Environment: our school has been found to be Well-Developed each year in School Culture. Every child is 
known by an adult. There are strong classroom cultures created with educators supported by administration and core 
staff. Many of our staff are returning which helps build a strong foundation. We have a plethora of programs that 
supply support and interest for a diverse student population ranging from Robotics to Broadway musicals. 

Strong Family and Community Ties: We host events such as monthly PTA meetings geared towards specific student 
groups, Awards Ceremonies, talent showcases, Family Paint Night, International Food Celebration as pre-
Thanksgiving. We have families  

Strengths : Our teachers for the second summer are participating in summer professional learning sessions. These 
sessions resulted in collaborative curricula aligned to our project themes and inter-disciplinary units and lesson plans. 
Our instructional focus in our first year was close reading, project-based learning, writing in all content areas citing 
evidence from the text, students teaching their peers through Socratic seminars, student created lesson plans and use 
of Accountable talk stems. Teachers identified areas that they wanted to improve in and received professional 
development and coaches to support them in that. All staff members take part in developing and leading professional 
development throughout the year. This has developed trust between teachers and with the principal. This trust is 
obvious as soon as visitors walk into our space and the classrooms. Through our relationships with parents and the 
leadership roles that students take on in every aspect of school life.  

We are a project based, STEAM-focused school. Our content is aligned to real-world projects in all classes. Our 
projects encourage students to investigate, research, inquire and find solutions to real world problems beginning in 
our community. For our 6 th graders each year will be an in-depth study of the lack of access to fresh foods in certain 
communities by creating surveys, surveying the community and analyzing the data. 7 th graders will research and 
study the issues humanity is facing around the globe with access to clean water. 8th graders will research, design and 
create a project centered around a social justice issue they are most passionate about. Their yearlong study will 
culminate in them delivering a presentation to stakeholders in the community. All students take computer science 
courses learning to code games. 

 

Accomplishments : Students have created and advocated for student events, elected an active Student Government 
Association (SGA) and hosted several successful events for parents and caregivers. All students gained valuable 
experiences and made curriculum connections by visiting the Museum of Natural History, Sony Wonder Technology 
Lab and Museum of Modern Art. The students also helped plan our first overnight trip to Washington DC for tours of 
colleges and historic monuments. The school was successful at hosting several open houses and 5 th graders had the 
opportunity to visit several stations that were led by our scholars who shared what a typical day looks like and 
physical education activities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
At HPCS, the Common Core Learning Standards are aligned to the learning that takes place in the classroom and 
throughout the school community. Unit plans and activities address elements of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) 
that supports students with special needs. Daily lessons also include differentiated supports to meet students at all 
levels. School-wide collaboration on instruction and curriculum creates engaging classroom activities and school wide 
events that challenge students’ thinking. Daily morning meetings with students foster challenging cross-curricular 
discussion related to content, school culture, and modern day events. Our students are problem solvers and use these 
skills for our project based learning initiative. 

Using a project-based learning model related to improving their communities, all students have the opportunity to 
engage in motivational long-term projects. Students will justify, demonstrate, and value why this project is important. 
Students will be able to speak to how it impacts their life and the lives of people that they care about. They will share 
the results of their research studies with the community through creative and meaningful products. Challenging 
curriculum is also weaved into students’ technology class, which integrates strong literacy and technology skills to 
create video games. 

● Strengths 

o Students are motivated to engage in and complete elements of project based learning 

o Common planning three times a week among teachers fosters collegial discussion that improves upon the quality of 
teacher planning and student work. 

o Rich, mature discussion in and out of the classroom using Accountable talk stems. 

o Writing across the curriculum pushes all students to improve writing practices. 

o Book clubs of high student interest engage students in reading and discussion. 

o Students teaching content to their peers with high quality rigorous lessons. 

● Priority Needs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

o More streamlined process to monitor the project while using all content areas to complete final product for Project 
Based Learning 

o In depth assessment of data from various assignments or pre assessments in order to increase support for students 
in the lowest third 

o Identify a literacy focus in instruction for ELL’s and IEP students to improve work products and skills level. 

o Increase reading and writing stamina for students who do not complete assignments in the time given. 

o Continued practice with substantiating a claim with relevant evidence and further explaining the relationship 
between the two. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 80% of students will move up at least two levels in reading from their current Lexile range and up at least 
5 points on their DRP assessment by June 2019 and 10 points on their Math assessment.

research-based protocols grade teams meet twice a week, once 
to develop rigorous lesson with aligned learning goals, 
instruction, and once to evaluate student work , make needed 
changes to learning goals 

● Teachers incorporate UDL accommodations for all students. 

● Special education teachers provide specially designed 
instruction (SDI) for students with disabilities. 

● Scaffold complex text using graphic organizers, visual aides, 
peer help (Greene, 2013) 

● Model activities: color code tasks; use sentence starters 
through accountable talk and sentence frames to jump start 
writing (Hermann, 2014) 

● Each teacher confers with students and sets reading , math 
fluency and writing goals based upon student work  

AIS Services  

● Push in by ESL and Special Education teachers for the majority 
of coursework; content area teachers push-in to self-contained

contained students are integrated for non-core courses 
(Mabbott & Strohl, 1992). 

● Small grouping/Flexible grouping/ Teacher conferencing 
(Elbaum et al., 2000) 

● Use of multiple entry points , regular teacher collaboration 
time and model strategies for student; Student teaching (student 
collaboration); Number and sequence the steps in the task; 
Provide visual aids during lessons; Show an end model of the 
product; Allow extended time for students without penalty; 
Shorten assignments and the number of tasks to focus on 
mastery of key concepts and standards; Provide students with 
writing prompts; scaffold questions for students; Use relevant 
data to differentiate task. 

We recognize that family and community connections on the 
middle school level will make a difference in our students’ 
success. Thus we have implemented 

● Parent workshops bi-monthly to teach specific skills and 
strategies students are learning in class 

● Awards, events to celebrate their child’s achievements 

● Use of our website, monthly newsletters, blogs, Pupil Path, and 
social media sites 

● Parent volunteers for projects, events and trips 

● Curriculum nights 

To reach our shared goal of student achievement we have 
instituted an open door policy. Specifically, all care-givers are 
continually encouraged to visit the school. Every Tuesday 
teachers are available to meet with parents and the staff and 
parent leaders’ lead care-giver workshops bi-monthly that 
support academic and socio-emotional growth. 

Care-givers are encouraged to participate and join our newly 
revised PTSA (Parent Teacher Student Association).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our school culture is our greatest strength and the key to our success in creating an environment that fosters 21 st 
century skills ensuring students are prepared for college as well as careers. Students are exposed to leading teams, 
using design thinking in all aspects of academic life whether to complete engineering projects or planning student 
activities. 

We are a uniform school believing our appearance should be a source of pride, connects us as a community and 
removes distractions from instruction. Our three tiered Advisory program consists of Morning Meeting, Advisory and 
Book clubs- all scheduled to support students in achieving our Core Values: Resilience, Empathy, Accountability and 
Leadership.  

Morning Meetings provide them the opportunity to express themselves and every Friday those who uphold the 
school’s culture by exhibiting our Core Values are nominated by peer and teachers, receive a t-shirt with that Core 
Value in the back and their photo is displayed on our bulletin board and website as students of the week.  

Advisory classes are taught by a team of four Advisory teachers that help the students to be aware of anti-bullying 
measures as well as weekly activities and conversations connected to the Core Values. and recognize different players 
and how they react to them. Students who exhibit off- culture behavior are given ‘Attention’ which is often during 
lunchtime 

HPCS has a Community Associate who creates a link between the school and wider community. Active communication 
takes place among staff members through our school website and shared information in Google doc. Through the 
school calendar and the community board, everyone is aware of upcoming events in a timely manner.  

Paul Bambrick-Santoyo in ‘Leverage Leadership’ 2012 stated that as members of a start-up school, its success is a 
collective responsibility. ‘We want to build a culture of open, honest and productive dialogue with one another.’ 
Additionally, we believe in our core values(REAL) and they are central to our interactions with each other.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Research has shown that learning is most effective when it is 
internalized and an individual is able to teach the newly acquired 
knowledge to others. Research has also shown that 
neoindigenous students facilitating learning in a culturally 
relevant way can lead to higher student achievement overall 
(Emdin 213). At HPCS we focus on students mastering content 
and then teaching their classmates to enhance the overall 
mastery of skills and standards while simultaneously helping to 
cultivate a culture of inclusion. 

We utilized the research-based work of R. Barth (1991) to impact 
change for our teachers and students through creating a 
professional learning community(PLC) comprised of grade level 
teaching teams and school community staff. Our focus for such 
meetings include 

● ensuring that students learn 

● a culture of collaboration 

● collaborating for school improvement 

● removing barriers to success 

● focusing on results 

● parent and family involvement 

● Project Based Learning initiatives (Solis, Larmer, Blabuenaga 
2014) 

To reach our shared goal of improved student achievement, we 
have also instituted a focus on over-age students with supports 
through tutoring and separate social activities such as the 
Chancellor recommended teen nights at museums, summer-
youth application support and mentors with quarterly career 
days. This has resulted in 100% of those at-risk students being 
promoted. In addition:

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Every Tuesday afternoon parents are able to come in to meet teachers without an appointment to discuss any 
concerns. Teachers are also able to use that time to reach out to parents about scholars' classroom progress. Teachers 
should keep a log of who is called and who comes in and what is discussed.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

● HPCS teachers attend teacher-led weekly professional development using Duplin Lesson Tuning Protocol and 
looking at student work based on research by Joseph McDonald in the Coalition of Essential Schools each week. This 
allows educators to collaborate in PLC’s in order to gain feedback from colleagues to improve their lessons and 
assessments.  

● Self-reflection is a key element in improving students’ academic progress. At the beginning of the year teachers 
complete Growing of Teacher Practice identifying their areas of strength and growth. This tool is critical in our 
pedagogical practice and improving student’s academic progress.  

● Our teachers identify and use misconceptions as part of our lesson pan template, created collaboratively, to 
support students understanding of content in lesson plans and use peer feedback to improve their practice. It is one 
thing to be knowledgeable in a specific subject area but to be able to execute a student-centered lesson 
demonstrates planning strategies that facilitates students’ mastery, such as collaborating in groups or students’ 
teaching lessons they have developed. 

Needs:  

● Support students in moving up at least one grade level from 5th grade DRA_2 scores 

● Independent reading initiative using Myon and care-giver support to support reading for at least 45 minutes a day 

● Professional Development to support all teachers to become reading teachers 

● Using Advance Summary Report % of teachers are developing in ……and effective in ……. 

● Established assessment calendar with evaluative time established to review data and make curricula adjustments 
using Rubicon Atlas 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Using the Advance MOTP Dashboard we have analyzed the data from both informal and formal observations and 
identified the following as indicated by the Danielson Framework: 

o 14% of teachers were rated “Effective” and 0% were rated “Highly Effective” on Component 3B 

o 29% of teachers were rated “Effective” and 0% were rated “Highly Effective on Component 3C 

o 21% of teachers were rated “Effective” and 0% were rated “Highly Effective” on Component 3D 

Our school’s strengths in effective leadership are: 

● Teachers plan and lead weekly professional development 

● Professional development hours are used to enhance pedagogical knowledge bi-weekly based upon teacher Google 
surveys and reflections. 

● Summer and evening planning for curriculum development aligned to our vision in all content areas 

● Researched best practices from workshops and readings turn keyed by principal and teachers weekly 

● Weekly interdisciplinary planning amongst teacher teams 

● Principal seeks and receives mentorship from varying industry experts relevant to her vision for the school including 
monthly mentor meeting from the Leadership Academy 

When implementing a progress oriented school improvement plan, it is critical for staff to work together to pursue 
common goals. Teams bring together complementary skills and experience that exceed the individual strengths of 
those working on their own. Teachers learn best from each other. They can support and assist each other in data 
collection and decision-making. Working in collaborative teams leads to more effective examination and 
implementation of best practice. 

Our needs are: 

● Use of MOTP data to inform, support and track teacher goals in addition to Growing Teacher Practice tool 

● Support for distributed leadership training for highly effective teachers and PD for the staff

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

● Staff professional development with emphasis on critical 
thinking and student achievement. As a staff, teachers will focus 
on how to implement critical thinking and problem solving more 
effectively in their classroom as aligned with the common core 
standards  

● Increased time for professional development as a collective 
staff.  

● Specific, actionable, timely feedback on classroom 
observations and inter-visitations 

● Teacher schedules will align to better support common 
planning for interdisciplinary practice between all content areas 

● Teachers attend content specific professional development at 
least quarterly  

● Consultation committee meetings 

● Data inquiry teams that analyze student work and share 
results with the community 

● Student voices are one of the most important and often 
neglected aspects of implementing academic and behavioral 
strategies. Giving students the necessary opportunity to assess 
and reflect on their needs and progress is critical. We achieve 
this with Individual Intervention Plans aligned to student and 
teacher created academic and behavioral goals (Wright, 2012); 
ongoing leadership opportunities at varying levels.  

● For many students a more interactive program is needed 
beyond sitting and talking. Providing time for 1-1 or small group 
counseling is critical with work and fitness with guidance 
counselor and/or physical education teacher

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Every Tuesday afternoon, parents are able to come in to meet with teachers without an appointment to discuss any 
concerns. Teachers are also able to use that time to reach out to parents about scholars' classroom progress. Teachers 
should keep a log of who is called and who comes in and what is discussed.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Progress monitoring plays a vital role in measuring success within the Highland Park Community School RTI 
framework. Success will be measured in the following ways: 

● The majority of students deemed initially at-risk are support with Tier 1 interventions 

● Students identified for Tier 2 and 3 interventions receive services from intervention team, CBO 

● Improved student outcomes, as measured by class course grades, performance on benchmark assessments 

● Low special education initial referral rates 

Midpoint Benchmark  

January 2017, academic interventions are included in all students individual goal plan and checked bi-weekly by 
advisors. 

Timeframe for Midpoint Progress Monitoring  

Students identified at-risk will initially receive Tier 1 interventions, to be monitored over a course of 6 weeks. 
Progress will be measured using on-going classroom assessment, including conferencing, and running records, writing 
samples and standard mastery checks. 

Goal setting sessions , followed by an assessment to follow up with are we accomplishing those goals.  

Meetings with specific, pre-determined action items. Results are related in that outcomes help inform and change 
our practices. Results also tell us which of our processes are most successful and which need alterations.  

● Improved student outcomes, as measured by class course grades, performance on benchmark assessments, and 
progress on NYS exams. 

● Low special education initial referral rates 

Students identified at-risk will initially receive Tier 1 interventions, to be monitored over a course of 6 weeks. 
Progress will be measured using on-going classroom assessment, including conferencing, running records, writing 
samples and standard mastery checks. 

Every two weeks, specific to the intervention being implemented the following will be re-assessed

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We understand that communication with care-givers is key.  

Our strengths: 

● Communication with current and incoming care-givers whether it’s by phone calls, letters or home visits. 

● We send home communications weekly in Spanish and English, update our websites, and social media page. Use of 
school messenger to send automated messages. 

● Although communication is important, there are always better ways to improve Parent and Caregiver engagement 
and consistent turnouts.  

●  

Our needs: 

● Financial and human resource support for monthly newsletter 

● Per session or grant funding for staff members that are experienced and/or can be trained to support families.  

● In order to expand our partnerships with community-based organizations (CBO’s) that support the specific needs of 
our families.  

● A reliable tool to determine the needs and wants of families, and offer workshops that service those identified 
needs. We must allocate funding that allows us to assess and track our outreach and training. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, HPCS will have completed family involvement cycles that provide 85% of caregivers with information and 
training needed to be active in their childs education as measured by caregiver engagement surveys.

Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
We believe the most important resource in a school is the human resource. As a startup we do not have the ability to 
have all personnel needed ideally to implement our plan and all staff members take on multiple roles. The ability to 
hire additional staff members, such as a secretary, parent coordinator, school aides and paraprofessionals allows 
teachers to focus on instruction, students and caregiver and community outreach.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Highland Park Community School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
[Highland Park Community School] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
We have a rapidly growing population of English as a New Language learners in our school. 
Current projections for next year show that we have 10 incoming ENL students in 6th grade, 15 
in 7th grade and 20 in 8th grade. Based on trends from the past two years we expect that number 
to grow. We plan to address the needs of this growing population by increasing their direct 
instructional time both after school and on the weekends. After school takes place Wednesdays 
through Fridays from 2:25 pm to 4:00 pm and Saturday school is held from 9:00 am to 12:30 
pm. This totals 7.35 hours of extra targeted instruction weekly or 455 additional minutes.  This 
program will run from October 25th- April 27th. We have one full time ENL teacher, Ms. 
Belal who does both push in and pull out ENL as well as after school ENL. In addition, we have 
a part time ENL/Italian teacher, Ms. Quarto, who also teaches push in and pull out ENL and 
Italian as well. Instruction is done in English, but translations are provided as scaffolds for 
students. Teaching materials include modified versions of all literature provided in the 
Humanities and Scimatics courses, audio books for all novels, differentiated graphic organizers 
and worksheets, NYSESLAT test prep books, FinishLine NY billingual common core practice 
books for ELLs, online sources such as Newsela and brainpopesl.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.   

rationale 

 
  schedule and duration 
 
  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
We believe that parent support is key to a child's success so we need as much parental 
involvement, especially with students who are learning a new language. Therefore, to support 
our students and families we will hold parent workshops quarterly. Each will last for an hour and 
a half and be held twice (once on a weekday evening and once on the weekend) to ensure 
flexibility for working parents and guardians schedules. Topics will cover how to support 
children at home with language acquisition, how to navigate the DOE as parents who are 
new  and unfamiliar with the system and expectations, the different stages of second language 
acquisition, and any other topics that parents identify they would like to be addressed in this 
workshop series. These will be provided by our ENL teachers and other teachers from within the 
school community. Parents will be notified through direct phone calls home (ideally in the 
language spoken at home), mailers that are translated into the home language, our school website 
(also with these announcements translated into the home languages of the families we serve), etc. 
Additionally, Cypress Hills, our SBO, also provides Adult Learner English Language classes to 
support parents in learning English if they are interested. 
 
The parent workshops are as follows: 
October 16th, 2017 5:30-6:30 pm- Overview of ENL program (pull out and push in) & 
expectations regarding academic performance and NYSLAT exam 
December 11th, 2017 - How to support your child in literacy, especially when learning a 2nd 
language 
February 12th, 2018 -  Math Phobia and supporting struggling and accelerated students in a 2nd 
language

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Degrees of Reading Power (DRP), MyOn (an online reading resource), Dibbles, Just Words to assess the early 
literacy skills of our ELL students.  The DRP assesses their comprehension skills and MyOn gives us their Lexile reading levels 
and assess their decoding skills.  Also, the ENL teacher assess their Sight Word recognition and uses the data to continue to 
build their fluency. Next year we are adding the ELL periodic assessment, recommended by BNSC. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have a data team who collects and organizes the data to formulate our intervention period groupings. This data is also 
shared with teachers who utilize it during their content courses. The ENL team will use this data to organize and group the ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

learners both within their classroom and for their intervention period. In addition, we have common planning daily so that ENL 
teachers can ensure and continuously monitor student progress. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The NYSESLAT data is analyzed to identify student strengths and weaknesses.  The students’ strengths are used as a scaffold to 
bridge to their weaknesses.  ELL's are assessed bimonthly on their literacy growth using MyOn assessments, Dibbles, Just 
Words and progress reports. Teacher teams meet weekly to  evaluate student work using an inquiry process. In addition to 
assessments in all content areas and those aligned to practice for the NYSESLAT, DRP assessments and Dibbles are used as well 
to determine growth.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have daily intervention periods and the groupings are flexible. We have 6 week cycles where we reassess and reorganize 
based on student growth and emerging needs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
RTI is an instructional model that aims at prevention and intervention through a tiered system of support.  So far, we have 
conducted a professional development for the entire teaching staff on ways to help meet the specific needs of our ELLs and we 
will continue to provide ongoing training. In addition we send teachers to Brooklyn North for ongoing development and 
training supporting ELL students. The teachers are cognizant of who the ENL students are and work with them in small groups 
to differentiate the instruction.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
For the new admits, the NYSITELL data revealed low scores across the listening, speaking, reading, and writing modalities. We 
use a myriad of assessments to evaluate and inform the effectiveness of our program. The assessments include:  The 
NYSESLAT Exam, NYS ELA and Math Exam, the Spring DRP scores, and for 8th graders the Living Environment and Algebra 
Regent exams.  
     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have a data committee that collects, organizes and distributes them to the staff through google drive. All teachers have 
access to the data at all times. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students in the Freestanding ENL program are grouped heterogeneously by grade level classes with mixed proficiency 
levels.  They are serviced by a certified ENL teacher who collaborates with the content area certified teachers to 
analyze data and plan best practices for teaching to the New CR Part 154 mandates.  
 
The organizational models are as follows:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

6th Grade: ENL push in/pull out model 
7th Grade: ENL push in/pull out model 
8th Grade: ENL push in/ pull out model 
 
Entering students are entitled to a minimum of 360 minutes of ENL weekly. This breaks down to 180 minutes of 
standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Emerging students are entitled to a minimum of 90 minutes of 
standalone ENL, 180 minutes of which is standalone ENL and another 90 minutes of either standalone or integrated. 
Transitioning students are entitled to 180 minutes of integrated and/or standalone ENL.  Students scoring at the 
Expanding level are entitled to 180 minutes of integrated ENL. The Commanding level students are entitled to 90 
minutes of integrated ENL, ELA or other content area instruction.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Highland Park Community School does not offer a TBE program at this time.   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Highland Park Community School does not offer a DL program at this time.    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                To ensure that all the students are receiving explicit ENL & ELA mandated instructional minutes we have flexible 
scheduling of push-in and pull-out services. This involves two certified ENL teachers pulling out small groups of students in the 
Stand-Alone ENL, as well as working collaboratively with certified content area teachers in Integrated ENL to comply with CR 
Part 154.2 mandates.  Entering students are entitled to a minimum of 360 minutes of ENL weekly. This breaks down to 180 
minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Emerging students are entitled to a minimum of 90 minutes of 
standalone ENL, 180 minutes of which is standalone ENL and another 90 minutes of either standalone or integrated. 
Transitioning students are entitled to 180 minutes of integrated and/or standalone ENL.  Students scoring at the Expanding 
level are entitled to 180 minutes of integrated ENL. The Commanding level students are entitled to 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL, ELA or other content area instruction.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  Work is being done through Inquiry to continue to align both to the Common Core State Standards, language progression 
standards and curriculum maps. This program uses hands-on projects and experiments to teach the content and academic 
vocabulary.  Writing within the content areas is also emphasized, as well as differentiation within small group instruction. 
There is a strong emphasis on developing academic vocabulary, summarizing content and cloze reading strategies. Students 
are given content based performance tasks.  MyOn, an online reading resource gives students access to books in English and 
Spanish and is used to assess the 6  th, 7  th, 8th grade students' Lexile and decoding levels.   
 
Upon analysis of the 2018 state Math scores, students will be assigned intervention periods to support struggling ENL 
students, if deemed necessary. Go Math is one of the resources used for Math intervention.  All materials are CCLS aligned.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The Pupil Personnel Team (PPT) meets monthly to review IEPs, evaluate placement, student progress and instruction. This 
team consists of a school psychologist, SETTS teacher, ENL teacher, related service providers and social worker. They consider 
the least restrictive setting when they evaluate the students’ IEP.   
The school meets the diverse needs of ELLs - SWDs by making sure that all students are taught with high standards and that 
rigor is maintained using ENL strategies in a push in/pull out model. All ELLs are serviced by an ENL certified teacher. Teachers 
meet for planning and articulation during common planning daily. All ELLs receive curricula materials aligned to CCSS for their 
grade level. ENL strategies and methodologies are implemented to guide the instruction. Daily intervention periods to provide 
additional and individualized support. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELL students receive Reading and Math intervention periods in small groups of ten or less, 5 periods per week.. Those who are 
Newcomers or Developing ELL's work with the ENL teacher and reading specialist using Just Words.  All teachers meet to 
discuss strategies for teaching academic vocabulary, close reading and informational writing to improve language 
development.  The NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math scores are assessed to meet the needs for all ELLs in the content areas. We are 
training and supporting teachers to create and implement language objectives in their daily lessons across the content areas. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have created a Scimatics and Humanities course that are inter-disciplinary. We have hired more teachers that are bilingual 
in Spanish to support students in and out of the classroom. We have hired an additional ENL teacher for the 2018-2019 school 
year.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Highland Park Community School will not discontinue any programs or services at this time. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Through the partnership with the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation, tutoring and academic support is provided to 
all students including ELLs for which several of our teachers are part of the after school staff  In addition to that, we provide 
targeted after school tutoring for entering and emerging students.

NYSESLAT practice books are used before the NYSESLAT exam. Just words are used for phonemic awareness and improving 
reading fluency for targeted students.  All content area instructions are aligned to the Common Core State Standards and 
lessons include scaffold supports for ELLs (picture concept vocabulary cards, differentiated worksheets, graphic organizers, 
sentence starters, sentence frames, sentence connectors, audio books etc.). 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 As a new school that only offers ENL, we pair ELL students with an English proficient partner to support them in their native 
language and use some cognates from glossaries to help transfer prior knowledge. Their home language is also used as 
scaffolds during the lesson. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ELLs are supported with grade level materials. Supports are based on age and appropriate level.

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not offer a dual language program.    
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic

The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at Highland Park Community School is to provide training in ELL 
pedagogy to all content and SPED teachers. This offered through in house professional development. Teachers also attend ELL 
related professional development outside of school. 
  
The professional development is differentiated based on need, experience, teacher license, and student data. Teachers are 
polled for their professional development needs three times a year which are then assessed by the principal. PD is then 
organized based on formal/informal observations and teachers' personal need. PD specifically for ELL's is included in the PD 
Plan for every quarter. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Highland Park Community School has partnered with the after school program and the Middle School Success Center which 
offer monthly trips to various high schools and provides literature and meetings on what is required for high school admission. 
Our teachers attend open houses for the high schools and support families in attending as well along with high school fairs. 
  
 The 7.5 hours of training is delivered during faculty conferences, inquiry team meetings, and grade meetings. Records are 
maintained by keeping sign in attendance sheets and agendas. 
 
Teacher's are also sent to Professional development events outside of school that is related to their content and ENL. 
   
    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents are invited during the beginning of the school year to a parent orientation which informs them about the ENL 
program. Parent engagement times are used to invite parents to discuss their children's progress .We are including workshops 
for parents about the changes in the Common Core state exams and changes in proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT. Parents 
are also encouraged to come in and observe their child's class.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parent involvement includes parents of second language learners on the School Leadership Team who help in the planning of 
food and clothe drives for students going through economic hardship, workshop series to support parents in helping their 
children with reading and math. Also, parents are kept informed about school activities with a monthly Parent Newsletter that 
is sent home in English and Spanish. Parents are contacted periodically and are invited to come into observe their child in 
his./her classrooms.

As a relatively new small school we have a significant ELL population for our size.  With the rapid change in our demographics we 
are continuously re-assessing the needs of our families, attending trainings and seeking resources to support our families.  We 
implement mostly push-in classes with some pull-out so we are not depriving students from their mainstream classes.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jamilah Seifullah, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
