Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission - We seek to create a challenging learning environment that encourages high expectations for success 
through developmentally appropriate instruction, which allows for individual differences and learning styles. Our 
school promotes a safe, orderly, caring and supportive environment. Each student’s self-esteem is fostered by 
positive relationships with students and staff. We strive to involve our parents, teachers and community members in 
our students learning 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Vision - A community of excellence that provides a supportive, diverse learning environment, which fosters academic, 
emotional, athletic growth and empowers our students to become productive citizens and leader . 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Middle School 256 Lafayette Academy is a middle school with 159 students from 6 through grade 8.  

Boys account for 54% of the students enrolled and girls account for 46%. The average attendance rate for the school 
is 87%. M.S 256 is housed in the Joan of Arc complex and shares a building with 2 other schools. M.S 256 is a screened 
school with a Dual Language French Program. Currently M.S 256 has a partnership with the Road to Success program 
which provides an after-school program for the students. Our school offers opportunities for our children to graduate 
with multiple credits for high school and offers specialized high school training for the entry exam. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school population comprises 47% Black, 49% Hispanic, 3% White, and 1% Asian students. The student body iAt 
256 we have a large population of Special Education students and English Language Learner’s. Their specific needs 
and what the school will be focusing on this year is adapting instruction through differentiation to allow these 
students an equal chance to succeed at getting a proper education. Through creating multiple entry points in all 
lessons and making sure to work closely with the English as a New Language teacher and Special Education 
department the teachers will be focusing on making sure that all the students at 03M256 will be able to keep up with 
the skill building and content despite the diversity of the their current knowledge. Includes 15% English language 
learners and 30% special education students. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the last year, through a variety of different practices 03M256 has made large strides in the “Trust” element of 
the Framework for Great Schools. Where in the past there was a deficit in “Trust” between the teachers and the 
administration, between the students and the administration, and between the students and teachers, there has 
been a cultural shift that is easily seen through daily practices and interactions. Lafayette Academy scored very high in 
the areas of "Effective Leadership" as well as "Collaborative Teachers" 

The key area of the Framework for Great Schools that 03M25 will be focusing on this year will be "Strong Family 
Community Ties"

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on teacher observations done by the administration, lesson plan checks, and the progress of the Special 
Education students as well as the English Language Learners there is a high need for the teachers to, during their 
planning, start to focus more effort in creating scaffolds and coming up with differentiated activities to provide equal 
access to each lesson to those who may struggle keeping pace with rest of the class. In addition the teachers need to 
be able to assess the progress of those scaffolds and make adaptations based on their inquiry. This is shown by 25% of 
the staff receiving a developing rating in 3D of the Danielson Rubric. In addition, with scores of 2016-17 being 23% 
proficiency in ELA and 16% proficiency in math, but the number of students passing core subject on their report card 
being over 80%, it was clear that this work was needed. On a positive note, while this need has been displayed via the 
Advance data and core subject pass rate, based on recent test results the school went up 25% on the ELA state exam 
and 16% on the math state exam  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will engage in four cycles of LASW protocols targeting ELL and SPED students, resulting in an 
increase of 5% in teacher proficiency for Danielson component 3c as measured by Advance.

• In order to support the teachers in meeting the goal of 
broadening their work around components 3D, the Danielson 
Rubric teachers will be given the necessary time required to “un-
pack” the components, meet and plan. All teachers have 
common planning periods built into their schedules. These 
meetings include, grade meetings, content area meetings, 
special education meetings, and co-teaching planning meetings. 
During these teacher team meetings teachers will design 
multiple classroom practices and tasks that fall under the 
Effective column in Danielson's Rubric in components 3D . School 
administration will join the teacher team meetings to coordinate 
the work across grades 6-8 and use the Atlas protocol and 
rubrics to look at student work focusing mainly on academic 
rigor.

Strategies to address the needs of Students With Disabilities, 
English Language Learners, and other High-need student sub-
groups  

● ELL students in the school will receive services from all content 
area teachers as well as the licensed ESL teacher. ELL students 
will receive both push in and pull out support. The ESL teacher 
will plan with the content area teachers to allow for more 
focused instruction. The ESL teacher will provides strategies the 
content area teachers can use in the classroom. The Principal will 
create time within PLC meetings for the ESL teacher to work with 
the content teachers. The principal will monitor progress and 
provide feedback through participation in these meetings 

● MS 256 provides support to our SWD's through ICT instruction 
and SETTS services. The Special Education department will take 
time in September to go over each student's IEP with the 
content teachers to discuss possible strategies that can be added 
into lesson plans that focus on providing more access to the 
SWD's.

Strategies to Increase Parent Involvement and Engagement  

M256 
Parents 

● At MS 256, we strive to ensure that the parents and the school 
are in constant communication. We want the parents to know 
the teachers here are constantly improving upon their practice 
and creating lessons that meet their children’s needs through 
higher level questioning and classroom discussions. Some 
strategies and activities that help us to ensure this is taking place 
are: 

a. Curriculum Night 

b. Parent Teacher Conferences 

c. Parent/Teacher Involvement (Tuesday afternoons) 

d. Parent Workshops 

Activities that address the Capacity Framework

● As a school community we work collaboratively to improve our 
pedagogical practice to support best teaching strategies and 
improve student achievement. In our school community we have 
the following practices in place: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a. TIF teacher coaches

``18-19 

c. Google doc (a shared site between teachers and 
administrators) 

d. 80 Minute weekly PD meetings (Mondays) 

e. Administrative preps 

 

● In addition to the collaboration listed above, transparency and 
communication among all constituents is extremely important. 
The following practices demonstrate this point: 

1. Teacher led professional development 

2. Students received a mock Learning Environment Survey for 
their voices to be heard 

3. The SLT invites parents to participate in meetings to get the 
parent perspective on what’s going on in the school. 

 

 
 

 
3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
PTA Workshops will be held by the Parent Coordinator to inform parents on what Rigorous Instruction looks like. They 
will look at samples of student work and participate in high level rigorous activities themselves to have a better 
understanding. Additionally information regarding Rigorous Instruction will be posted on our website. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 Based on the number of OORs incidents last year, 44 incidents fell in the Level 3 category, primarily consisting of 
infractions with B21 infractions. According to the data, many of the students who received these suspension where 
special education students. Recently we have begun looking at restorative justice as a method discipline. 

 

Based on the data our suspension rate is above the district average and specifically for SWD 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, Lafayette Academy will revise our school advisory system to strengthen students' social and academic 
needs, resulting in a 30% decrease in the number of incidents at level 3 and level 4 as measured by OORS.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Research-based Instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact 
change:  

 

- MS 256 Student handbook which outlines clear expectations 

-Class section sheets: Every class carries the sheet from period to 
period, earning a score collectively and individually for their 
performance in that period 

 

 

-Classroom conduct posters will be posted in each classroom 
that explains to the student what the teachers expectation are of 
them in regards to following rules, when they are supposed to 
do work, and when to pay attention to the teacher 

 

-To support positive behavior, MS 256 has a Student of the 
Month Program where we recognize those students who provide 
community service, excellent academic determination and are 
well behaved. 

 

- Town hall meetings, which are held monthly in the auditorium 
by the principal. Meeting topics include grades, progress reports, 
report cards, school-wide expectations and upcoming school 
events.

all relevant school information is listed 

- The entire MS 256 School Community has been informed on 
the NYCDOE Discipline Code as we use it to ensure a clear 
understanding of the implications of behavioral infractions 

 

-Parents are given progress reports about their children and are 
given the opportunity to come to the school to meet with their 
child’s teacher. Teacher and parents engage each other in 
communication via Jupiter grades, where parents are made 
aware of student’s scores on assessments, unit projects, etc… 

Strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities, 
English Language Learners, and other High need sub-groups  

• School Intervention team- This team meets monthly as a 
student support mechanism where they address the needs of 
Students with Disabilities and the ELL population. Here IEP 
recommendations and updates are discussed with teacher and 
guidance support. 

Activities that address the Capacity Framework element of Trust 

• Monday and Thursday Teacher Team meetings 

• Tuesday Parental Outreach 

• Parent Workshops 

• Grade level and Content Area Team Meetings 

• Principal-Teacher Goal Setting Meetings 

• Benchmark Assessments 

• Data Analysis to help inform instructional decisions

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Based on observations done by the administration during the 2017-2018 school year, lesson plan checks, and the 
progress of the Special Education students as well as the English Language Learners there is a high need for the 
teachers to, during their planning, start to focus more effort in creating scaffolds and coming up with differentiated 
activities to provide equal access to each lesson to those who may struggle keeping pace with rest of the class.  

 

In addition the teachers need to be able to assess the progress of those scaffolds and make adaptations based on 
their inquiry. This is shown by 25% of the staff receiving a developing rating in 3D of the Danielson Rubric. In addition 
0% of my ELL and Special Education population were proficient based on the NYS ELA exam  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, due to increased collaboration between general education and special education teachers, inter-
visitations, and visitations at other schools focused on looking at creating multiple entry points and differentiation, there 
will be a 5% increase in student progress for all ICT, SETSS, and ELL students as shown on the NYS ELA Exam

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

During the 2017/18 school year the focus of the administration was to have teachers developing a student analysis for 
each of their unit assessments, to determine how each student did on each standard assessed. While the data was 
finally being created, it wasn't being used to drive instruction. This was seen through classroom observations, teacher 
meetings, and unit plan collections. According to my Principal Performance Observation the focus of the teacher work 
needs to be on student impact. The average level of the teachers rating in component 3D according to the Danielson 
rubric is 2.8. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, Administration will develop and implement a coherent system of teacher feedback that will result in at 
least 4 meetings with each teacher about student progress, resulting in a .15 school wide average increase in Danielson 
Component 1e.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Research-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact 
change. 

- Provide student analysis worksheet to the teachers, as well as 
professional development in the beginning of the year as to how 
to use the work sheet and what the expectations are. 

 

- Provide the teachers with the expectations of the student 
analysis sheet, as well as the adaptations to the unit plan in the 
handbook they receive in the beginning of the year  

 

-Provide professional development to the teachers throughout 
the year focusing data analysis, feedback, creating assessments, 
seeing trends in data, and using data to drive instruction 

 

-During department team meetings teachers will use the ATLAS 
protocol to look at not only their lessons but at the student work 
and assess whether or not the changes made based on the data 
is having an effect on student outcome. The administration will 
be able to monitor the progress by observation of protocol or 
looking at team notes.

Strategies to Increase parental Involvement and Engagement 

At MS 256, we strive to ensure that the parents and the school 
are in constant communication. We want the parents to know 
the teachers here are constantly improving upon their practice 
and creating lessons that meet their children’s needs through 
higher level questioning and classroom discussions. Some 
strategies and activities that help us to ensure this is taking place 
are: 

a. Curriculum Night 

b. Parent Teacher Conferences

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

With few hits to the school website ms256.net and only 35% of the parents signing on to their Jupiter Grades account, 
the school needs to work to increase the level of parent participation to improve on the instructional outcomes of the 
schools lowest third of students. The numbers coincide with the lack of communication between the parents and the 
teachers, the low attendance at PTA meetings, and the lack of participation in email communication between the 
school and community. In addition, in June of 2018 our overall attendance rate was 91% which we would like to 
increase. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

By June 2019 we will increase traffic to our school website and participation with Jupiter Grades by 15% by focusing on, 
promoting, the website as the main portal through which all school information and communication is accessed and 
conveyed. This will result in a raise in the student performance by 5%.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Several strategies have been developed to address recruitment, retention, assignments, and support to ensure highly 
qualified teachers at MS256. All teachers at MS 256 teach at least 65 percent of his/her schedule within his/her 
certified content areas. Administration is actively reviewing schedules and student enrollment information in to order 
to plan, prepare for, and seek out highly qualified and experienced teachers for the next school year.  

The school promotes teacher autonomy and the development of teacher leaders by utilizing a staff Professional 
Development Team (PD Team) and Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) Team to identify areas of whole staff and individual 
teacher needs in order to plan and implement targeted professional development in specific areas of need. The PD 
team works with administration to plan and effectively utilize weekly after school PD sessions to improve teacher 
capacity in areas such as curriculum mapping, lesson planning, assessments, and meeting the needs of all learners. 
The TIF team, consisting of peer instructional coaches and demonstration teachers, act as liaisons and facilitators of 
best practices, plan inter-visitations, collaboratively debrief and reflect on lessons and instruction with staff members, 
and create ways to share best practices and resources with the whole school community.  

Lastly, teachers have also have received support in specific areas of growth and development as determined 
collaboratively by the administration and/or the teacher. For example, new teachers to the DOE with less than two 
years’ experience receive mentoring support from in house mentors and network provided content area coaches on a 
weekly and bi-monthly basis. More experienced teachers are encouraged to seek out professional development that 
will address areas of growth and/or further improve his/her practice. These include work with Teacher’s College, the 
Museum of Natural History, Urban Advantage, Wilson Reading Program, the French Embassy, FHI360 and the Cluster 
511. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
There have been numerous strategies and activities created to build teacher capacity for teaching and implementing 
the Common Core State Standards in MS256 classrooms. First and foremost, teachers have received ongoing 
professional development that is focused on curriculum mapping and unit planning that is aligned to the Common 
Core Learning Standards. Taking place during the allotted afterschool professional development periods with the aid 
of the PD Team and administration, teachers have received tools and training in order begin to create a curriculum 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

(from year-long maps, pacing calendars, unit plans, assessments, learning tasks/portfolio pieces, and lesson plans ) 
that are holistically aligned to the Common Core Curriculum. Teachers then brings his/her work into weekly content 
area team meetings in order to receive peer feedback and continually make reflect make improvements and as 
student outcomes are assessed throughout the year. This area of professional development is ongoing and teacher 
work products are living and breathing documents that are continually reviewed for improvement, continuity, and 
alignment to the Common Core in order to build a solid foundation for future teachers at MS 256.  

In addition to school wide focus around curriculum planning and the implementing the Common Core Learning 
Standards, several of the MS256 teaching staff have worked onsite with network coaches and/or attended content 
specific professional development on planning and preparation and alignment to Common Core State Standards. 
Many have turn-keyed the information in whole staff meetings or content area team meetings. Staff members, both 
new and experienced , have attended professional development in areas such as Universal Design for Learning 
(meeting the needs of all learners in a Common Core Classroom), Natural History Museum’s Science and the Common 
Core, Algebra and Gateway to STEM Learning, and Aligning and Writing Quality IEP’s to Common Core.

improve instruction.    
Teachers have received professional development and continued support in the development appropriate multiple 
assessment measures. These areas are addressed in a variety of ways at MS256. The professional development team 
works to plan and implement afterschool PD sessions that address measures of student learning, the planning and

creation of assessment, using student data to drive instruction, and reflecting upon student work. Content area teams 
meet weekly and will begin implementing the ATLAS protocol analyzing and providing feedback on student work in 
order to improve future student outcomes and improve future assessments and instruction. Teachers are required to 
maintain current portfolios that include a variety of measures of student performance that are aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Lastly, teachers in need of more individual support in the area of assessment and 
data driven instruction have access to network coaches, mentors, or peer instructional coaches on an as need and 
ongoing basis. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to

combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. M256 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

M256 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

M256 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
MS256 uses the following tools to assess the early literacy of our ELL students: 
In general, the early literacy skills of ELL students are assessed in the same way that non-ELL students are assessed. This year, 
as a part of the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI), we are using the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment, WIST, 
and TOSWFR 2 assessments. This specific assessment data impacts Common Core aligned instruction school-wide, providing 
the ESL push-in/pull-out teacher, as well as the grade-level content teachers, the ability to engage the ELLs with content 
material that is on their reading level. We supplement this with Accelerated Reader (AR) – an online system that levels 
students and tracks their reading of appropriately leveled books. Results from these assessments allow us to zero in on the 
literacy levels of our ELL population. In addition to mandated ESL services, ELLs also receive supplemental literacy support in 
daily, strategic reading periods.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

  
Our data regarding ELLs reflects an trend across all three grade levels indicating that ELL students require additional target 
language supports mainly in reading, writing and math. We also realize that many of our students are coming to MS256 at 
already below grade level performance based on Common Core standards.  To remediate this situation, we adhere to an 
intervention plan which provides additional supports and scaffolds in each lesson, a focus on small group work and more 
individualized attention, and access to multiple points of entry into each lesson, especially for our ELL students. This academic 
year our ENL Coordinator/Teacher, Mr. Kilpatrick, participated in an extensive training program offered through MSQI with 
Wilson Reading and JustWords, two highly regarded Orton-Gillingham phonics based programs. The WIST and TOSWFR 2 
assessments were administered as part of this program in the beginning and at the end of the school year. Data collected was 
immediately used, in conjunction with students' DRP scores, for placement purposes into these two programs, and will be 
used to determine placement for those students continuing these programs into the 2017-18 school year.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

As previously mentioned in Question #1, we use a variety of data sources (NYSESLAT test scores, DRP scores, WIST, and 
TOSWFR2 scores for a variety of purposes: 1) when considering which Stand-Alone ENL classes to assign individual students; 2) 
small group assignments in core content classes (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies); 3) for Grade Team and Content Class 
meeting Inquiry projects; and 4) combined with IEP information to address any specific needs for our ELLs who are also 
receiving Special Ed. services. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We administer the WIST and TOSWRF 2 assessments to our ELLs twice a year to determine their progress specifically in the 
area of Wilson and JustWords pull-out classes. 
 
Our ELL students also participate in school-wide NYC Performance Tasks (translated when needed) in all content areas. 
 
As previously mentioned in Question #1, we continue to identify a high-need among our ELL population for 
Beginner/Newcomer ENL/ELA services in the form of phonics-based instruction, and remedial reading and writing instruction, 
in order to bring all students up to grade level. 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

All teachers participate in school sponsored ENL Professional Development sessions at least twice a year conducted by our ENL 
Coordinator/Teacher Mr. Kilpatrick.  
 
All teachers are encouraged to also participate in ENL Professional Development opportunities sponsored by the City of New 
York throughout the school year.  
 
This year, our 6th grade ELA Teacher, Ms. Camilo, and our ENL Coordinator/Teacher, Mr. Kilpatrick, participated in a two-day 
ELL PD which focused on using grade level texts with ELLs in the ELA classroom. 
 
Our Science Teacher, Ms. Salazar, along with our ENL Teacher, Mr. Kilpatrick, participated in a two-day ELL PD which focused 
on using the Next Generation Science Standards specifically with ELLs in the Science classroom. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We are a middle school, grades 6-8.  
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
At the beginning of each academic year, we refer to the the Spring NYSESLAT results, along with Spring NYS ELA and Math 
Exam results to establish ELL students' proficiency levels and for placement considerations in various ELL pull-out classes. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Through the use of shared documents on Google Drive, our ENL Coordinator/Teacher, Mr. Kilpatrick, makes 
NYSESLAT proficiency score data available to all teachers at the beginning of the school year, as well as periodically throughout 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

the school when needed. 
 
NY State Math and ELA test results are disseminated at the beginning of the academic school year by the Principal to all 
educators and staff members in the form of hard copies of test results and access to online shared spreadsheets of test 
results.   Educators have immediate use of this valuable data to plan each class, specifically for small groups, identifying 
students with higher needs, identifying target students for Inquiry projects, and classroom seating charts. 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ENL Teacher/ Coordinator, Mr. Kilpatrick, works closely with our ELA Teachers, Mr. MacCullough and Ms. Camillo 
to provide integrated ENL services based on a push-in model where Mr. Kilpatrick enters the ELA classroom (block 
model) and essentially co-teaches with the classroom teacher. During these integrated sessions, students are grouped 
heterogeneously based on proficiency levels within one class. This manner of grouping lends itself to having students 
of higher proficiency levels help students at lower proficiency levels. In this model, the ENL teacher is able to serve 
several heterogeneous groups of ELLs per period. 
  
Mr. Kilpatrick also provides stand-alone ENL to ELLs at all proficiency levels, more so with EN/EM ELLs in order to 
meet the additional required minutes of ENL service requirement as per CR Part 154. During these sessions, he uses a 
pull-out model with students from various grade levels/classes based on similar proficiency levels, and grouped 
(homogenously) according to proficiency levels. In this fashion, the instructor can maintain a lower teacher:student 
ratio for small group instruction, and students can focus on particular skills/tasks that are relevant to their individual 
grade/proficiency level.  
 
This year we began using two Orton-Gillingham phonetic-based programs (Wilson Reading and JustWords) with our 
ELL students during their standalone ENL periods. 
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our school does not provide this program model at this time.  
 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Grouping is done through cooperative learning, mostly in heterogeneous groups based on ability and proficiency 
levels. A combination of English and French are used for instruction. Our ENL Teacher does not currently push into our 
two DLP classes (French Language Arts and Social Studies) as the target language focus for these classes is not English, 
but French. 
 
Our ENL Coordinator/Teacher uses the guidelines provided in the CR Part 154 regarding number of mandated minutes 
and combinations of Stand-Alone and Integrated ENL when planning for ENL services for all ELLs.  Integrated ENL 
takes place in the ELA classroom along with the ELA Content Teacher. Stand-Alone is done on a pull-out basis with 
targeted groups of ELLs working on either phonics-based reading programs (Wilson Reading and/or JustWords) 
and/or NYSESLAT Prep (which covers all four modalities over the course of the academic school year). 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

As we have several Teachers who are fluent in both English and French and/or English and Spanish, bilingual 
instruction is used in core content classes when beneficial for those students whose home languages are either 
French or Spanish. 
 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Freestanding ENL: 
  
As required in the revised regulations of CR Part 154, students receiving ENL services receive a combination of standalone and 
Integrated instruction.  ELL students receive their required units of integrated ENL when our ENL Teacher/Coordinator, Mr. 
Kilpatrick, pushes-in to ELA classrooms working side-by-side with the ELA classroom teachers. ELL students receive their 
required number of standalone ENL minutes during Mr. Kilpatrick's pull-out periods specifically geared to ENL curriculum. 
  
Dual Language:  
  
In our Dual Language (French/English) program, language is taught through content areas as well as through literacy. The new 
language (target language) is French. During Dual Language program class periods (French Language Arts and Social Studies), 
students generally receive 100% of their instruction in French. Our French Language Arts instructors, Ms. Leboeuf and Ms. 
Nickerson, will also augment their instruction with English as a means of scaffolding lesson content delivery.  
  
In both our Freestanding ENL and Dual Language instructional periods, explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA minutes are delivered as per 
the revised CR Part 154.2 Units of Study and Staffing Requirements directives while putting together our ENL services schedule 
which differentiate between Language Arts and Bilingual Instruction. Minutes of service vary according the students’ 
proficiency levels and varying combinations of stand-alone, integrated, and/or flexible instructional models.  
 
We refer to the CR Part 154 guidelines to fulfill the mandated number of instructional minutes (combinations of Stand-Alone 
and/or Integrated) for our ELL students in both the Freestanding ENL and the DL programs.  Mandated ENL minutes are as 
follows: Entering (EN) and Emerging (EM) = 360 minutes; Transitioning (TR) and Expanding (EX) = 180 minutes; Commanding 
(CM) = 90 minutes.  
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All content areas are delivered in English using ENL methodologies and instructional strategies with language development 
support in the students’ native languages. Teachers develop their own curriculum in alignment with the Common Core 
Standards to deliver content-specific instruction. 
 
In our ELA integrated classrooms, core content is scaffolded by the ENL Teacher as well as by the Classroom Teacher to 
accommodate the needs of all ELLs.  Multiple entry points to content are provided through the use of, but not limited to, the 
following: translated text, use of graphic organizers, extensive use of glossaries, extensive use of imagery (pictures) to support 
new vocabulary and concepts, cloze reading passages with word banks, abridged text, dictionaries, etc. 
  
French language instruction is used for our students in the Dual Language program during two periods per day: French 
Language Arts (FLA), and Social Studies (SS). During these periods, French language texts and teaching materials are used to 
supplement and scaffold instruction. French dictionaries and glossaries are made available to students.  
  
In our ENL Library, we maintain native language reading materials that are age and grade appropriate and reflect current units 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

of study in all content areas. Students are provided with bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, technology enrichment in the 
native language, and a buddy system to provide scaffolded support to newcomers. Teachers with groups of ELLs who share a 
common language organize collaborative tasks that target content and generate interactions in the native language among 
peers. 
  
Cooperative learning strategies are utilized in addition to scaffolding to ensure that all learning styles are addressed. ELLs are 
encouraged to think critically, solve problems and communicate both orally and in writing in the language of instruction. 
Engaging students in real-world experiences enable them to place a context to the language they are learning. These tasks are 
given to allow students to apply the content material they have learned. Accountable talk is encouraged to enhance language 
proficiency through oral discussion by modeling language acquisition for students. Lessons are differentiated and choices are 
given to students to provide multiple entry points for taking in information. 
  
In both our ENL and Dual Language models, sheltered instruction is used as a method of teaching English Language Learners 
English (and/or French) language acquisition through the integration of both language and content. Sheltered instruction 
provides access to mainstream, grade-level content, while promoting the development of English (and/or French) language 
proficiency. Our instructors incorporate the use of translation, content-specific materials in home languages, content-specific 
texts in the target language(s), visual imagery, realia, videos, audio books, picture dictionaries/glossaries, etc. to provide a 
variety of supports and scaffolds for our English Language Learners to achieve our goals of assisting ELL students acquire 
content-specific knowledge while simultaneously developing their proficiency in the target language(s).  
 
I believe the above description sufficiently addresses the question of "how our ELL students will meet the demands of the 
NYS Learning Standards" and, more specifically, we as Educators are working for our ELLs to help them meet these stringent 
and challenging academic demands. 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our 6th, 7th, and 8th grade ELLs who are native French speakers enrolled in our French Dual Language program are monitored 
daily in their home language during their French Language Arts (FLA) and Social Studies (SS) class periods.  Our French 
teachers, Ms. LeBoeuf and Ms. Nickerson, preside over both of these classes and use a variety of formal and informal 
assessment techniques, such as pre/post tests, quizzes, homework, observations, oral interviews. 
 
We also have three bilingual Spanish teachers (Ms. Soto, Ms. Camilo, and Mr. Lanvin) who, although are not teaching in a 
formal Spanish Dual Language program, are able to assess our native Spanish speakers using their home language. This is done 
is Social Studies, ELA, and Math classes. 
  
ELLs are permitted to use their native language abilities to complete tasks. They are also allowed to express their knowledge in 
the language they are most familiar with when being addressed. By allowing our students to use their native language to 
process their answers during assessments, their content knowledge will be reflected more accurately.    
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

When differentiated instruction is provided, particular consideration is given to all ELL subgroups. For each subgroup, we have 
identified an instructional plan for the academic year. 
  
a.     SIFE 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

  
b.     Newcomer 
  
Newcomer ELLs are expected to make progress in their English language development at a rate that allows them to 
communicate in basic English within 12-16 months, and to work towards the development of beginner academic English skills 
within the first 24 months. To help accomplish these goals, Newcomer ELLs are provided additional class periods on a pull-out 
basis to meet one-on-one or in small groups with our ENL Teacher/Coordinator, Mr. Kilpatrick. During this time, and depending 
on each student’s specific needs, Mr. Kilpatrick will work on a variety of skills in each modality. Students will have the 
opportunity to work independently or in small groups, use laptop computers, practice phonics, and work with a variety of 
differentiated materials, such as bilingual dictionaries, flash cards, visuals, manipulatives, and realia. 
  
  
c.     Developing 
  
  
d.     Long Term 
  
  
e.     Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status 
  
We continue supporting our former ELLs for two years after they reach (Commanding) proficiency. We ensure that they 
receive extended time during all ongoing assessments throughout the year. In addition, they are offered the opportunity to 
participate in any after-school programs.  
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs who have been identified as having an Individual Education Plan (IEP), as students with special needs, will have an action 
plan designed by a team which includes the classroom teacher, the IEP Coordinator/Teacher, and the ESL teacher. These 
specified instructional plans will take into account the student’s instructional goals, as well as their challenges as determined 
by the student’s NYSESLAT or NYSITELL score. The Special Education Teacher, the IEP Teacher, and the ENL Teacher 
communicate to align instruction to ensure that the student’s educational goals stated on the IEP are being met (in the least 
restrictive environment).  
  
All providers of services to ELLs use visuals, manipulatives, and other concrete materials for all content areas. Teachers 
differentiate learning center activities and hands-on experiences that allow for increased student choice. During writing time, 
students are provided with writing frames (language patterns). Academic vocabulary is enhanced through instructional 
strategies such as use of realia and manipulatives that provide students multiple access points to learning, as well as increased 
references to prior knowledge without dependence on target language proficiency. All assessments are analyzed and action 
plans are revisited to address the students’ next steps. Classroom instruction, as well as assessments, follow the Common Core 
Learning Standards. 
  
We also incorporate the use of technology as a means of accelerating English language development with our ELL students.  A 
brand new, state of the art, laptop cart, compete with 30 MacAir laptops, is available to all teachers for in-class use with 
students. ELL students (and non-ELL students) conduct online research, experiment with interactive software programs such as 
Renaissance 360, Max Scholar, Readworks Digital, Wilson Reading, and JustWords to practice phonics, reading comprehension, 
and grammar, and take online assessments as ways of increasing target language proficiency levels. 
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

Through a combination of integrated and standalone ENL, the ENL Teacher is able to provide the mandated number of ENL 
units to ELL students also designated with an IEP in the least restrictive environments. During these classroom times, tasks are 
specifically tailored to each student's needs with the goal of providing individualized instruction that will increase target 
language proficiency. 
 
All ELL students with IEPs are invited to participate in our after-school program which provides additional support through 
content lessons while addressing the proficiency needs of the students.  Our ENL Teacher/Coordinator is able to be quite 
flexible with his schedule from week to week in order to ensure that all ELLs are meeting their mandated minutes of ENL 
service, as per CR Part 154 guidelines. 
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The following targeted interventions are used for ELLs in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science:  
  
Intervention services are provided in English, French, and Spanish by those Teachers who are proficient in any/all of these 
languages.  The above-mentioned statement clearly states that these intervention services are being used in all four core 
content areas (ELA, Math, Social Studies, Science).  All ELL who are mandated to receive ENL services are being targeted, with 
consideration to proficiency levels (and concurrently with mandated number of service minutes). 
 
This year we had the largest number of ELL students testing "Commanding" on the 2017 NYSESLAT. This data indicates to our 
Educators that their combined intervention efforts for our ELL students is clearly making an impact on our students' learning 
and growth. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the upcoming school year, MS256 is intending to consider the following programs: 
Leveled Libraries are not a new improvement - we have recently made efforts to improve the quantity and quality of materials 
that are available to our students in our Leveled Libraries. We are continuing our efforts to seek grant funding to incorporate a 
greater amount of authentic French language resources into our Dual Language Libraries, and also diversify the materials to 
better represent the variety of Francophone countries from which our students come. 
 
ELA and Math Test Prep is conducted every year starting in January as another intervention service to help prepare our 
students for the NY State ELA and Math exams in April.  These programs are made available to both ELL and non-ELL students, 
specifically targeting students who demonstrate a need for further intervention in these two core content areas. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 
We currently have a French Dual Language (Bilingual) Program, in addition to our Freestanding ENL Program. 
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At MS256, ELL’s are given equal access to the same programs as non-ELLs when it comes to after-school and supplemental 
services. Fliers are translated into French and Spanish. Should any students with other home languages need translated copies, 
we can arrange to have fliers copies using the Translation & Interpretation Unit’s services.  
  
For example, we work collaboratively with the "Roads to Success" organization to provide a wide array of after-school 
programs to all of our students who are interested and obtain the proper permission from parents/guardians. Roads to 
Success after school programs include: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

  
MS256 offers a CHAMPS sports program that includes: 
  
MS256 also offers after-school test prep classes to assist students to improve proficiency and, in turn, improve performance on 
NY State exams. 
  
ELLs at MS256 are invited to participate in any of the above-mentioned activities with proper parental permission. We find 
that our ELL students are eager to participate in the wide variety of programs offered at MS256 through our collaborative 
organization "Roads to Success." Throughout the day, ELLs are welcomed by their non-ELL peers and assimilated into their 
overall classroom settings by fellow students, teachers and staff.  
 
With 2016/2017 Title III Funding, we conducted an After-School Reader's Theater Program that specifically targeted our ELL 
population.  This program met three days per week for approximately 90 minutes per class and ran from January through June 
2017.  
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials specifically geared to our English Language Learners include:  
Title III funds were used to purchase one set of Reader's Theater Fluency and Comprehension materials by Benchmark 
Education Company.  Other materials specifically targeting our ELL students include: English/French and English/Spanish 
Oxford Picture Dictionaries; English/French Larousse translation dictionaries. 
 
Educators at MS256 are very resourceful at finding a variety of bilingual materials online to use when scaffolding individual 
lessons; or they create many materials by themselves.  Particularly in our French DL Program, our Educators have found it very 
challenging to find authentic French language materials that address American History for Social Studies. In turn, they create 
most materials themselves. 
 
In Science, Educators will also translate many materials from English as we often do not have funding to purchase materials in 
French and/or Spanish. 
 
In Spring 2017 MS256 received local funding to purchase and install state-of-the-art Smartboards in all classrooms. Teachers 
incorporate videos, interactive activities, and powerpoints in most lessons to incorporate the growing interest in and 
availability of technological resources in our classrooms. 
 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Dual Language program: 
  
French dual language classrooms and are equipped with a variety of materials that support the development of language 
acquisition and content skills, such as: 
In our French Dual Language classrooms we also provide a variety of written texts in the Home Language (French), along with 
teaching aids, manipulatives, and scaffolding materials that allow students of various levels the multiple entry points required 
for the Target Language. These "enrichment" strategies allow for fostering of target language development with instruction by 
a native (and/or highly proficient) speaker (Ms. Leboeuf and Ms. Nickerson) practicing instruction in both French and English. 
Ms. Leboeuf uses the specific process of "cooperative and process writing instruction" making connections between the Home 
and Target languages at all times. 
 
Classes are "departmentalized" by content area and by classroom teacher. There is a school-wide understanding of this type of 
"enrichment model" towards Dual Language instruction that provides continuity from what students have learned previously 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

in elementary school that enhances effectiveness and allows for future expansion and growth. There is also a concurrent focus 
on "biliteracy" in both French and English through the collaborative support of the NY State Common Core Learning Standards. 
 
ENL program: 
 
Freestanding ENL classrooms are filled with a variety of visually appealing and relevant charts, cognate translation boards, 
word walls, sentence/question stem charts, and materials that provide native language support as a means of scaffolding for 
our ELLs when support is necessary. Students are provided with glossaries in the Home Language to help support content 
knowledge; electronic dictionaries are made available to help support writing comprehension; content books in Home 
Languages are used to support literacy; peer support by students who speak the same Home Language provide help with 
second language acquisition; and teachers who speak the same Home Language are available for intervention when necessary. 
  
Also in our ENL program, instruction is given in English using the Home Language as a means of supporting and scaffolding 
lessons and concepts when necessary. Grade level Home Language libraries are openly displayed and readily accessible to 
students in every classroom. 
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

To ensure that all required ENL services/resources are age/grade appropriate in order to effectively support our ELL students, 
Educators solicit resources that are either at, just below, and/or just above age/grade level to provide multiple entry points to 
information to students at a variety of learning levels and styles.  
 
Grade level texts are either edited, abridged, or segmented for targeted comprehension use with our ELL students. By sourcing 
materials at a variety of age/grade levels, students at multiple levels of learning can gain access to content-specific 
information. 
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We share our building with two other DOE schools; however, all three schools act autonomously and do not interact, aside 
from sharing the gymnasium, cafeteria, auditorium and other public space.  
 
We share a gymnasium, cafeteria, and auditorium with the two other schools in our building. All of our students, ELL or non-
ELL, have access to both of these facilities. As our ELL and Special Ed students are integrated into each classroom, no students 
are denied access to any particular space, such as the gymnasium, cafeteria, or auditorium. 
 
When it comes to the academic, linguistic, and socioemotional needs of our ELLs (and non-ELL) students, it is the responsibility 
of our Educators and Administrators at MS256 to address these needs specifically for our entire student body. 
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
MS256 conducts a “New Student Orientation” every July and August for all new incoming students. During this orientation, ELL 
students are provided oral translation in French and Spanish by MS256 staff members who are proficient in these languages. 
For any other languages, MS256 makes arrangements to have documents translated into the parent’s preferred language(s) 
through the use of the Translation & Interpretation Unit’s services. 
 
Throughout the school year, whenever MS256 receives a new ELL student, the same translation services are arranged, either 
in-house or by the T&I Unit. Our Parent Coordinator, Ms. S. Fikaris, School Secretary, Ms. E. Rangel, and our Spanish speaking 
teachers, Ms. E. Soto, Ms. M. Camilo, and Mr. R. Lanvin provide translation in Spanish. Our French Language Arts teachers, Ms. 
P. Leboeuf and Ms. M. Nickerson, and our ENL Teacher/Coordinator, Mr. G. Kilpatrick, as well as our Math Teacher, Mr. R. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

Lanvin, provide translation services in French. Any other languages that require translation services are accommodated 
through the use of the Translation & Interpretation Unit.   
 
Our Guidance Counselors, Mr. K. Greenfield and Ms. S. Finkel, provide translated services with the help of one of our bilingual 
teachers, for any 8th grade ELLs preparing for the High School application process.  Parents are often also included in these 
one-on-one sessions to inform them of the often confusing and detailed process of applying for High Schools in New York City. 
  
Whenever a new ELL students is enrolled at MS256, we make every effort to conduct daily, weekly, and monthly “check-in” 
sessions with those students. Our ENL Teacher/Coordinator, Mr. Kilpatrick works closely with our Parent Coordinator, Ms. 
Fikaris to ensure that all newly enrolled ELLs are getting the support that they need in the adjustment process to their new 
school environment. We also conduct specified parent outreach via telephone, email, and mail to inform parents/guardians (in 
their preferred language) of upcoming events, PTA meetings, Parent-Teacher Conferences, special school days, etc. in order to 
keep them informed of the many events that affect their child’s educational experience. We also encourage our ELL parents 
(as much as our non-ELL parents) to play an active role in the MS256 educational experience by attending meeting and 
events.  When required, translation services are provided in French and Spanish by in-house staff/teachers, and any other 
languages are accommodated using the Translation & Interpretation Unit’s services.  
 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We currently offer Spanish as an elective to all students (ELLs and non-ELLs) at the 8th grade level.   
 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the 
instructional day (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
  
MS256 uses a “two-way” and/or “dual language” model of instruction.  Students enrolled in the Dual 
Language program receive 50% of their core content classes in French and 50% in English. These students 
receive instruction in a “full inclusion” classroom setting (i.e. both ELL and non-ELL students who are 
enrolled in our Dual Language program receive instruction in French in two core content areas in the 
same classroom setting) where our two French Language Arts (FLA) Teachers, Ms. Leboeuf and Ms. 
Nickerson, employ a “sheltered instruction” approach that provides students with continuing French 
language development, access to core curriculum, and opportunities for classroom interaction. 
  
b. In which language(s) is each core content taught? 
 
Core content is taught mainly in English, as we have no self-contained ENL classrooms.  The only two core 
content classes taught in the Home Language (French) are FLA (French Language Arts) and Social Studies 
(for those students in the Dual Language Program). 
 
c. How is each language separated for instructions? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

  
For students in the Dual Language program, they receive instruction in French in both French Language 
Arts and Social Studies.  All other content areas are instructed in English with supports in either French 
and/or Spanish as needed by individual students. 
  
  
c. Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught 
at the same time (simultaneously)? 
  
During our dual language instruction, 50% of instructional time is in French and 50% in English.    
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In September 2016, our ENL Coordinator/Teacher Mr. Kilpatrick attended an extensive 4-day PD/Training hosted by MSQI of 
the highly regarded Orton-Gillingham based Wilson Reading System and JustWords Reading System programs. Beginning 
immediately after the training period, Mr. Kilpatrick began implementing both systems with two target groups of English 
Language Learners and has continued these programs throughout this academic year. In February 2017, Mr. Kilpatrick was 
selected by MSQI to host an all-day "Intervisitation Session" in which approximately 50 teachers from all five boroughs of New 
York City came to observe Mr. Kilpatrick implement both the Wilson Reading System and the JustWords Reading System with 
his ELL classes.  The day was co-planned with MSQI and involved a variety of session focused around using these two phonics-
based programs in the classroom. 
 
In Winter 2017, our ENL Teacher/ Coordinator Mr. Kilpatrick partnered with our ELA Teacher Ms. Camilo to attend a two-day 
PD entitled "Scaffolding Grade Level Text with Emerging and Entering ELLs." This PD used an 11-step model designed by the 
NYC DOE in conjunction with AIR (The American Institutes for Research) to tackle the often-challenging task of using grade 
level texts with lower level ELLs in an ELA classroom.  Both Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Camilo turn-keyed their findings from this PD 
to the entire MS256 teaching staff during our mandated PD time. 
 
In Spring 2017, our ENL Teacher Coordinator Mr. Kilpatrick once again partnered with our Science Teacher Ms. Salazar to 
attend a two-day PD entitled "Using the NGSS to Plan Curriculum That Addresses the Language Needs of ELLs in the Bilingual 
Classroom." This PD focused on rolling out the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) while specifically supporting English 
Language Learners in the Science classroom. 
  
Our two Guidance Counselors, Mr. Greenfield (mandated SPED counselor) and Ms. Finkel (whole school at-risk intervention), 
receive specific in-house professional development that targets our ELL students’ need, e.g. scaffolding for ELLs, assessing ELL 
curriculum needs, intervention for ELLs, etc. They also participate in outside professional development opportunities that 
specifically related to ELL student and parents make the transition to high school. 
  
Our school secretary, Ms. Rangel, and our Parent Coordinator, Mr. Fikaris, both long-standing NYC DOE employees, 
continually participate in a variety of professional development trainings each academic year. Every September, our ENL 
Coordinator/Teacher Mr. Kilpatrick conducts a mini-training for Ms. Fikaris and Ms. Rangel to review any revisions to the CR 
Part 154 compliance requirements that specifically address ELL reporting and compliance.  
  
All teachers servicing ELL students at MS256 are encouraged to attend ELL-specific professional development opportunities. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

We are connected to the Department of English Language Learners and Special Services (DELLSS), as well as our Manhattan 
District 3 Office, through email alerts to inform staff of new and upcoming ENL and Dual Language specific professional 
development opportunities. Specific professional development opportunities taken advantage of thus far in 2016/17 have 
included: 
Our calendar for in-house PD dates is as follows: Mondays, 3:10pm – 4:20pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:00am-8:35am. 
   
At MS256 we have ELL students in all seven of our classes (601, 602, 603, 701, 702, 801, 802); therefore, all teachers have 
received ongoing professional development that is focused on curriculum mapping and unit planning that is aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Through professional development opportunities (both in-house and outside) MS256 
teacher continually receive  tools and training in order to create a curriculum (from year-long maps, pacing calendars, unit 
plans, assessments, learning tasks/portfolio pieces, and lesson plans ) that are holistically aligned to the Common Core 
Curriculum.  
  
Teachers bring their background knowledge and pedagogic skills (results of what they have acquired through professional 
development) into weekly content area team meetings in order to receive peer feedback and continually reflect and make 
improvements as student outcomes are assessed throughout the year.  This specified area of professional development is 
ongoing; teacher work products are living and breathing documents that are continually reviewed for improvement, 
continuity, and alignment to the Common Core in order to build a solid foundation for future teachers at MS 256.  
  
In addition to school wide focus around curriculum planning and the implementing the Common Core Learning Standards, the 
majority of the MS256 teaching staff have worked, and continue to work, with MSQI coaches who come to our school weekly 
to develop new skills for curriculum planning and preparation specific to the needs of our English Language Learners. During 
weekly grade team and content team meetings, teachers are able to turn-key information to colleagues.  Over the summer 
break, many teachers take advantage of MSQI-sponsored, and NYC DOE sponsored, PD opportunities in areas such 
as:  Universal Design for Learning (meeting the needs of all learners in a Common Core Classroom); Restorative Justice, and 
STEM. 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Regarding the required ELL-specific professional development time as part of CR Part 154, we provide a minimum of 15% for 
all Teachers, and 50% of total hours for ENL/Bilingual Teachers. These professional development hours focus on best practices 
for co-teaching, integrating language and content instruction for ELLs, and scaffolding/differentiation techniques for ELLs. 
Agendas and sign-in sheets are kept for all professional development sessions in our ENL Coordinator’s office.  
  
In addition to our in-house schedule of weekly professional development sessions, our ENL Teacher/ Coordinator Mr. 
Kilpatrick, and our DLP/FLA Teachers Ms. Leboeuf and Ms. Nickerson, attend NYC DOE sponsored professional development 
sessions that is specifically relate to the ELL student/parent population.  These out-of-house professional development 
opportunities help to make up the required 50% of total PD hours specifically for our teachers in the TESOL and French DLP 
license areas. 
 
Examples of ELL-specific professional development opportunities that our ENL/FLA teachers have attended this year include: 
Manhattan Office District 3 NYSESLAT-specific professional development; Changes to the CR Part 154 training;  Using Grade 
Level Texts with Entering and Emerging ELLs in the ELA Classroom; Using the NGSS to Plan Curriculum That Addresses the 
Language and Content Needs of ELLs in the Bilingual Classroom. 
  
Our calendar time for in-house PD dates throughout the academic year is as follows: Mondays, 3:10pm – 4:20pm.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents of ELLs are invited to a one-on-one meeting half way through the academic year to meet with the ENL 
Coordinator/Teacher, Mr. Kilpatrick, and review each child's progress, the goals of the ENL/DL programs, and our goals for 
helping each child reach his/her maximal language proficiency. 
 
Invitation letters are sent out to all ELL parents with each child. 
 
Sign-in sheets keep record of all those who attend.  For any parents who are unable to attend, individual meetings via 
telephone or email can be arranged. 
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
MS256 encourages ELL parents to be actively involved in all ongoing activities. We evaluate the needs of our parents and work 
together to meet those needs through various resources. During the school day, parents are invited to attend monthly SLT 
meetings, and workshops presented by our PTA, as well as attend educational class trips. MS256 provides support and 
technical assistance in planning and implementing effective parental involvement activities to improve student achievement 
and school performance, namely through invited participation in the following events: 
 
To increase parental participation and involvement, parents are encouraged to take part in the following activities: 
Parents receive regular information updates via Jupiter Grades email blasts, letters in student bookbags, and telephone blasts 
regarding school events, workshops, employment opportunities, and other relevant information. Parents who have requested 
materials in their preferred language receive translated materials done by our in-house teaching staff for French and 
Spanish.  For all other languages, we enlist the services of the Translation & Interpretation Unit.  
 
To help staff support our ENL students as they transition from elementary school to middle, and from middle school to high 
school, our team of Guidance Counselors, School Social Worker, School Psychologist, and Parent Coordinator work in 
alignment with classroom teachers and ENL and Special Education teaching staff members to support our incoming students 
from elementary school in making the transition to middle school, as well as guiding our 8th graders as they prepare to move 
on to high school.  
  
Two incoming 6th grade orientations are conducted in August to help all incoming 6th graders prepare themselves for the 
rigors of middle school-level instruction. Our Parent Coordinator will translate in Spanish, and arrange to have a French-
speaking teacher available to translate in French, regarding the rules, expectations, and guidelines to help them make the 
transition to middle school.  Guidance Counselors are available to work with any students who are having trouble adjusting to 
their new school environment.  
  
Outgoing 8th graders are guided through the process of applying for high schools throughout New York City by our Guidance 
Counselors and Parent Coordinator through information sessions and outreach programs. Translation is provided when 
needed, school tours are arranged, assistance is provided when writing application essays and completing applications. Our 
Parent Coordinator reaches out to all 8th grade parents to explain the process of applying for NY City high school(s) and inform 
them of the services we provide to help them through this process. 
  
Our two Guidance Counselors, Mr. Greenfield and Ms. Finkel, through the NYC DOE Office of Guidance and School Counseling, 
receive updates on profession developments opportunities targeted at middle school students transitioning to high school, as 
well as 5th graders coming into middle school. They receive electronic copies of the Counselor Connections Newsletter, a bi-
monthly newsletter is designed to keep school counselors, social workers, and SAPIS connected to important policies,

resources and opportunities that directly impact their work with students, families, and educators. 
 
ELL parents are encouraged to attend and participate in all activities, workshops, and informational opportunities, just as non-
ELL students. We do not make a distinction as to who can and cannot participate in any school sponsored event. Our school 
philosophy is based on "inclusion" and "welcoming newcomers." We welcome participation by any and all parents/guardians 
in the variety of activities and informational events throughout the year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Brian Zager, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At MS256, a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is given to each parent registering a child into a DOE 
school for the first time, or for students who have been out of the NYC DOE system for more than two years. The 
HLIS is used to determine the native language of the child, in particular the language most commonly used at 
home.  

We analyze the RHLA (Home Language Report) from ATS periodically to identify the native/home languages 
present in our school population each year. We also obtain information from the Emergency Contact cards on 
which parents indicate their preferred written and oral language of communication. Based on the findings of the 
RHLA and Emergency Contact cards, we are able to identify the specific families and languages requesting 
translation services.  
 

 
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
