Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At Digital Arts and Cinema Technology High School, we provide a rigorous academic program dedicated to closing the 
achievement gap that prepares students to be college and career ready. Students are immersed in authentic learning 
experiences in the fields of digital art, film and technology. 

Through a specialized program that incorporates academic, creative and technical skills, students are prepared for 
post-secondary education and to pursue a career in the field of media. By maintaining a collaborative and supportive 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

learning environment, students who graduate from Digital Arts and Cinema Technology High School are persistent, 
resilient and capable of being successful in college and beyond. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
On July 1, 2016 we changed our name to Digital Arts and Cinema Technology High School (Digital Tech). Changing our 
school's name has helped us increase our enrollment and has given us the opportunity to further refine and develop 
our digital arts and cinema production programs. It has also made us expand our definition of what it means to be 
college and career ready. As of a result of these programs, our students' art work and films have been exhibited at 
various cultural institutions, and students have worked as interns at different organizations. Students have had to 
speak publicly about their work and have had to interact with professionals in the field. This prepares students for 
both college and the workforce in that it increases their ability to articulate their thoughts and ideas in a professional 
manner. It also gives them real world hands-on experiences.  

During the 2017 - 2018 school year, we were featured on Channel 12 News for our collaboration with the Success 
Academy school located on our campus, one of our students' photographs was selected by PS Art to be shown at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and three of our students spent a month in Italy because of our partnership with the 
Palazzo Strozzi Foundation. Our college partners are New York City College of Technology and Long Island University. 
We also are an Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) school and partner with OneGoal. Both of these 
programs offer college preparatory classes that provide social emotional and academic support to all students.  

At Digital Tech, we believe that when you create a consistent culture of high expectations and provide students with 
the necessary supports, they achieve success. We believe in providing students with a well-rounded education that 
allows them to develop their creativity and individual talents. This philosophy is supported by our partnerships.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We are a screened school and students that apply to us have a strong foundation or interest in the arts.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we have made the most progress in this year are Collaborative 
Teachers and Trust. Since 2016 - 2017, we had a 30% increase in positive responses for Collaborative Teachers and a 
52% increase in positive responses for Trust. This year we will focus on Rigorous Instruction and Supportive 
Environment. We received a 4% increase in positive responses since last year in Rigorous Instruction, and though 
Supportive Environment was not rated, there is a strong correlation between both elements when it comes to student 
engagement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. Our strength relevant to this Framework element is that we set high standards in every classroom so that students 
are actively engaged and thinking critically. This can be seen in the data from the School Quality Guide and in our 
credit accumulation rates. We received a 4.02 in the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide. This is a 4% increase from the 
2016 - 2017 school year. As indicated in the Student Transcript and Academic Reporting System (STARS), we also had 
high credit accumulation rates across all grade levels. During the 3rd marking period in the Spring term, the 9th grade 
had an overall 95.54% credit accumulation rate, the 10th grade rate was 91.37%, the 11th grade rate was 95.41% and 
the 12th grade rate was 98.66%.  

2. The priority need relevant to this element is to increase our Regents passing rates in English Language Arts (ELA) 
and Algebra. We need to have our credit accumulation rates align better with our Regents scores. Even though we 
scored a 3.96 in Rigorous Instruction in the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide and are above both the borough and 
citywide averages, we still only had a 54% passing rate of 65 and above on the June 2018 Algebra Regents. According 
to STARS, the 9th grade passing rate for the 3rd marking period in the Spring Term for Algebra was 82.22%. In ELA, the 
course had a 86% passing rate and a June Regents passing rate of 78%. Our action plan therefore includes using 
formative assessment to drive instruction and using the Understanding by Design (UbD) method to create curriculum 
maps and identify key standards.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
To increase our June 2019 Regents passing rates by 5% in Algebra and English Language Arts as indicated in STARS.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
In order to engage families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and the Common Core Learning 
Standards, we will offer family workshops. Topics will include the following: Understanding the Common Core 
Learning Standards, College and Career Readiness Benchmarks, How to Help Your Child with Homework, and How to 
Get Into the College of Your Choice. We will also host two Curriculum Nights - one in the Fall Term and one in the 
Spring Term. In addition during our weekly Parent Engagement Time, we will invite parents in to meet with their 
child's teachers and discuss his or her academic progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. Our strength relative to this Framework element is that we have created a college going culture where students 
feel safe and supported. This is evident in both the data from our School Quality Guide and in our daily attendance 
rate. According to the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide, we had an 87% positive response rate in the Guidance 
section of Supportive Environment; this was higher than both the borough and city average. Students feel supported 
when it comes to their college and career goals. We also had a 86% positive rate when it came to the Safety section, 
our score of 3.89 was once again above the borough and city averages. Also, according to Automate the Schools (ATS), 
our attendance rate for the 2017 - 2018 school year was 89.7% 

2. Our priority need relevant to this Framework element is that we need to have more consistency across classrooms 
when it comes to expectations. We also need to focus more on peer to peer feedback. In looking at the 2017 - 2018 
School Quality Guide, we scored lower when it came to Classroom Behavior. We scored a 63% positive rate, and even 
though it is higher than the city and borough average, it is still too low. The same holds true for Peer Support for 
Academic Work. We had a 66% positive response rate. In the Classroom Behavior section, 62% of the students "say 
that most students listen carefully when the teacher gives directions." In the Peer Support section, 67% of "students 
say that most students feel it's important to come to school everyday. " From this data it shows that teachers need 
more strategies on how to effectively engage all students. Teachers also need to be able to differentiate instruction in 
order for students to feel challenged, supported and recognized. 

3. In order to support the whole child, we partner with AVID and OneGoal. In AVID and OneGoal classes, students 
learn organizational skills, study skills and receive social-emotional support. Another goal of each program is raise 
students' college selectivity levels. Each student also receives four years of either digital art or cinema production 
classes. Each art program provides a forum for student creativity and expression. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, to increase our attendance rate by 5% as measured by Automate the Schools (ATS).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our school's strength relative to this Framework element is that we have highly collaborative teachers. Teacher 
teams meet regularly and participate in intervisitation cycles. This can be seen in how teachers responded to the 
School Quality Guide survey. In the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide, we received a 4.02 in the Framework Element 
Collaborative Teachers. This was a 30% increase from the 2016 - 2017 School Quality Guide. In 2017 - 2018, 90% of 
the "teachers say that they look forward to each working day at their school." In the 2016 - 2017, only 65% of 
"teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they usually look forward to each working day at their school." In addition in 
2016 - 2017, 59% of teachers "agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend their school to other teachers 
as a place to work." In 2017 - 2018, 85% percent of teachers would recommend their school to other teachers.  

2. Our priority need relevant to this Framework element is to vertically align the curriculum so that each grade level 
builds on the next. Teachers will collaborate and identify core standards and key skills that students need to graduate 
and plan backwards from there. According to the 2017- 2018 School Quality Guide, 60% of students say they feel 
challenged in their classes. This coupled with 84% of teachers saying that "students feel challenged" shows that there 
needs to be a clearer alignment across grades and within departments. Aligning the curriculum from grades 9 -12 will 
ensure coherency and ensure that coursework becomes increasingly complex as it builds from year to year. This will 
increase our students' ability to think critically and our college and career readiness scores. In June 2018, 48 % of the 
students that took the ELA Regents received a college readiness score of 75 or above, and 39% of the students that 
took the Algebra Regents received a college readiness score of 70 or above.  

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will have a 5% increase in the number of students that receive college readiness scores in the ELA and 
Algebra Regents.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

PD time will be devoted to vertically aligning the curriculum. 
Teachers will spend time on unpacking what students need to 
know and be able to do at each grade level. Using the UbD 
method, teachers will plan backwards from the Essential 
Questions and Enduring Understandings of each discipline.  

Performance tasks will be designed to assess if students can 
transfer the big ideas they learned into new situations. 
Strategically designed performance tasks have various access 
points for ELL's and SWD's. They also allow high performing 
students to extend their knowledge. PD time will be devoted to 
making sure performance tasks align with the stated goals of the 
units.  

Rubrics will be designed for the 21st Century Skills we want our 
graduates to possess. These rubrics will be used schoolwide to 
design performance tasks and create daily activities. Teachers 
will assess student performance using the criteria of these 
rubrics and analyze the results during grade team meetings.  

Each department will design discipline specific Transfer Goals. 
These goals will build in complexity from grade level to grade 
level, but also be evident in every class that is taught.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our strength relative to this Framework element is that teachers' observation ratings have improved. This means 
that teachers are getting meaningful feedback on their teaching and improving their practice. According to the 2017 - 
2018 School Quality Guide, we had a 6% increase in the Effective School Leadership category from the 2016 - 2017 
school year. With a score of 4.21, this is our highest rated Element. Also according to the Advance Rating System, 76% 
of our teachers had an Effective Measures of Teacher Practice (MOTP) rating in the 2017 - 2018 school year. 4 out of 
17 teachers received a Developing MOTP rating, and 2 out of those 4 teachers were first year teachers. This is up from 
63% in the 2016 - 2017 school year.  

2. Our priority need or goal in this Framework element is to increase the level of questioning and discussion across all 
classrooms so that it is more student driven. In the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide, only 68% of teachers said that 
students build on each other's ideas during class discussion. In addition, according to the Advance Rating system 
Teacher Performance Overview, teachers received the lowest rating in component 3B: Questioning and Discussion. 
The highest score on the Danielson Rubric is 4 for Highly Effective. The lowest score on the Danielson Rubric is 1 for 
Ineffective. The average score for teachers in 3B was 2.59. 7 teachers received Developing ratings for 3B and 6 
teachers received an Effective rating in this component. Having teachers be more effective in questioning and 
discussion will increase their ratings, and it will also increase the number of opportunities we give our students to 
think critically.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, to increase the overall number of teachers being rated Effective in 3B: Questioning and Discussion in 
Advance by 5%.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

School leaders will conduct more frequent observation/feedback 
cycles, identify actionable next steps, and have planning 
meetings with teachers.  

Part of our UbD work is creating indicators around 21st Century 
skills we want our graduates to possess. At the end of the 2017 - 
2018 school year, we created a rubric around the following 
indicator: Students will collaborate and communicate effectively 
by incorporating multiple perspectives. Grade teams will use this 
rubric to plan lessons and inform instruction.  

Content coaching cycles from the consultants of Metamorphosis 
will focus on questioning and discussion. Teachers from all 
subject areas will be work with the coaches.  

Schoolwide PD will be led by teachers proven to be effective in 
questioning and discussion. Peer Collaborative Teachers will also 
lead schoolwide PD in addition to scheduling inter-visitations.

strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
As a CEP goal, teacher improvement in questioning and discussion techniques will be reviewed at every School 
Leadership Team (SLT) meeting. These meetings take place once a month. In addition, questioning and discussion will 
be part of our instructional focus next year and will therefore be discussed during our fall and spring curriculum 
nights.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our strength in this element of the Framework is our strong family ties. Families feel welcomed and supported by 
the entire school community. According to the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide, we received a 3.44 score in this 
element. This was up 29% from last year. Also, 93% of the families say they feel well informed and 100% of the 
teachers say that staff regularly communicate with families about how they can help students learn.  

2. Our priority need in this element is to take more advantage of the community's resources to improve the 
experiences of our students. This is also evident from the data in the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide. 33% of 
families stated that we needed stronger enrichment and after school programs. One of our goals last year was to 
increase the number of partnerships we had and for these partners to provide our students with internships. This not 
only increases their level of college and career readiness, it gives them on the job training. During the 2017 - 2018 
school year we had 25 seniors, and 16% of those seniors had internships with outside partners. One senior who 
worked at a virtual reality company was also offered a paid position there over the summer.

with Pratt Institute. Teaching artists from these organizations will 
provide instruction in our classrooms and outside venues for our 
art exhibits. The arts provide hands-on activities, multiple entry 
points, and various forms of assessment. The arts also provide 
our students with disabilities, English language learners and 
other high-need student subgroups with alternate ways to 
express their thoughts and ideas. These partnerships will also 
allow our students and our teachers to network with 
professionals in the field.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Currently, all teachers are considered highly qualified. Teachers are programmed within license area, and when 
possible, within grade level preference. In order to retain highly qualified teachers, teachers are given leadership roles 
within the building and are supported when pursuing administrative certification. Teachers are also provided with 
ongoing professional development so that they can continually improve their practice. Each year, all teachers are 
given the opportunity to attend the week long Summer AVID Institute. In addition, teachers are encouraged to attend 
outside professional development offered by some of our partnerships. This helps retain teachers because they are 
always offered opportunities for professional growth. It also helps us recruit teachers because they not only know 
that they will be offered support right from the beginning, they know what the school's expectations are. In addition, 
new teachers are recruited by school based committee members to ensure all new hires are qualified and can 
contribute to the school community. Ongoing professional development is led by the Principal, the Assistant Principal 
and the coaches from Metamorphosis. Professional development is also led by our AVID site team and therefore also 
increases our retention efforts.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Ongoing professional development is embedded in the process of aligning the curriculum. Teachers focus on the 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and making sure that they are embedded in their curriculum maps. Professional 
Development at the beginning of the school year is devoted to designing rigorous instruction, rigorous assessments 
and on planning backwards. Baseline and beginning of the year assessments are used to identify standards that 
students need to focus on and data inquiry work is spent on identifying strategies that enable all students to the meet 
those standards. Teacher teams meet weekly and unpack the data after every end of unit test. School leaders and 
data team leaders meet monthly to analyze the data and develop next steps for individual teacher teams. Teachers 
use the online program Datacation to track the mastery of standards and to identify how to support individual 
subgroups including ELL's and SWD's. This process is repeated during the entire school year with the results from unit 
tests, periodic assessments and content specific Measures of Student Learning (MOSL). Paraprofessionals are part of 
the data team meetings and learn how to leverage the results of the data meetings to support their individual 
students. The principal and assistant principal also get support from our superintendent. Teachers attend trainings

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Periodic assessment decisions are made in collaboration with teacher leaders from every department. In addition, the 
MOSL committee, made up of teachers and administrators, collaboratively make MOSL selections. Departments plan 
curriculum maps and unit assessments together and use the data from these assessments to drive their instruction. 
The coaches from Metamorphosis work with teachers in order to support their data analysis. Teachers in every 
department learn how to analyze the data in a meaningful way and how to identify the key learning standards needed 
to support their students. The data results from each unit test are reflected in teachers' curriculum maps. Ongoing 
professional development is provided on how to create quality curriculum maps and staff developers from Datacation 
provide on site professional development on how to use the software program to disaggregate data. Curriculum maps 
are therefore consistently being revised and revisited based on student performance.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Digital Arts & Cinema Technology High School, in compliance with the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Digital Arts & Cinema Technology High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Digital Arts and Cinema Technology High School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Every Student Succeeds 
Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will 
share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At Digital Tech, we use Achieve 3000 at the high school level to assess ELLs reading level and literacy skills.  Additionally, we 
use teacher-created assessments to determine ELLs writing, listening and speaking skills.  We use this data to inform our 
schools' instructional plan by determining students' strengths that need to be built upon and students' weaknesses that need 
to be improved. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures we have in place to support this effort are opportunities for teachers to common plan by department and to 
meet by grade level to ensure students are being supported in meeting standards and gaining content knowledge to be able to 
perform on course assessments. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At Digital Tech, we use NYC Performance Tasks and Mock Regents Exams to measure student progress in their courses.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers meet as data teams to identify standards that are met, gaps in the data 
and next steps in our instruction and planning to close the gaps. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At this time, Digital Tech does not use RtI.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to our NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data, students continue to struggle with organizing and developing their writing 
skills.  As per the assessment, students were asked to read a passage and develop a specific type of writing (narrative, 
informative, etc.)  The majority of students struggled with developing each type of writing.  In addition, students struggled 
with the speaking section because they: did not understand the question asked, did not have enough background information 
to articulate their ideas and/or did not speak clearly.  Students did better with reading comprehension, but it will need to 
continue to improve their ability to answer text-dependent questions as well as inference questions.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Digital Tech uses the push-in model so that the ENL teacher, Ms. Miller, may work in small groups with ELLs to support them in 
their content classes while further developing their literacy skills.  In addition to best teaching strategies for ELLs, the ENL 
teacher uses home language tools, such as the interpretative services to translate class documents and differentiates tasks and 
assessments so that students may demonstrate their knowledge of content. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At Digital Tech, based on a students' proficiency level, students will receive both stand alone ENL and/or integrated 
ENL/ELA/Content Area courses.  In the integrated courses, the ENL teacher and content area teacher will co-teach and 
work collaboratively to implement high quality differentiated instruction for all students, especially ELLs.  In the stand 
alone ENL course, students will work in a small heterogeneous group with the ENL teacher to explicitly develop 
literacy skills in English.  In order to fulfill the regulations implemented by CR Part 154.2,  students' proficiency level 
will be considered when programming students for stand alone ENL and integrated courses.  A student's proficiency 
level will also determine the amount of minutes.  Students home language will be supported and utilized in the 
following way: through the use of native language textbook components, the push-in model and interpretation 
services.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 Digital Tech ensures that ELLs receive the mandated number of instructional minutes by having the programmer, guidance 
counselor and ENL coordinator collaborate to make sure ELLs are appropriately placed in a stand-alone and/or integrated ENL 
course.  Digital Tech has a free-standing ENL program model, thus, as per CR Part 154.2, the ENL instructional minutes are 
delivered in the following way: 
•     Entering and Emerging (6-8): Receive 360 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/ELA 
•     Transitioning (6-8): Receive 180 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/Content Area 
•     Expanding (6-8): Receive 180 minutes per week of integrated ENL/ELA 
•     Commanding (6-8): Receive 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL/ELA 
•     Entering  (9-12): Receive 540 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/ELA 
•     Emerging (9-12): Receive 360 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/ELA 
•     Transitioning and Expanding (9-12): Receive 180 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/Content Area 
•     Commanding (9-12): Receive 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL/Content Area   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Our students are placed in mainstream content area courses including: Math, Science, ELA and History/Social Studies.  All 
courses are delivered in English, however scaffolds and differentiation strategies are part of daily instruction to ensure that all 
students are engaged in learning the course material.  For example, a newcomer or entering student will be paired with a 
bilingual peer during partner and group tasks.  The bilingual peer is a supports the ELL student by providing information, 
directions and clarification in the ELLs home language.  Additionally, teachers will use visual aids, audio support, tactile support 
and graphic organizers to ensure that ELLs are able to make the material comprehensible and help the student develop 
academic language.   
  
At Digital Tech, we follow the workshop model for reading and writing.  We focus on developing all language domains 
fostering academic language by utilizing a variety of materials.  The materials used are aligned to the Common Core Standards 
are provide rigorous learning for all students.  Teachers create literacy-based classrooms by displaying student work, using 
word walls and anchor charts that illustrate reading and writing strategies used in the classroom. ELLs have access to academic 
language and literacy strategies at all times, which allows them to develop their language and make the material of the course 
comprehensible. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year by: 
•     Being provided the Spanish Lab as a newly registered student and if Spanish is identified as the home language. 
•  A periodic assessment will be administered and analyzed each quarter.    
Having entering and emerging students take the New York State Mock Regents Exams in their home language.  This will 
provide benchmark data for content area teachers to determine how well students will do on the Regents Exams (other than 
ELA). 
•     School developed culturally non-biased assessments 
   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

d.     Long Term: Students may receive graphic organizers, visual aids and sentence stems.  Students receive a reference sheet 
for speaking prompts. 
e.     Former ELLs: Students will be provided with graphic organizers for writing and note taking.  Students will be provided 
guiding questions for texts.  Students will receive these additional services for two years. 
Students will receive appropriate testing accommodations such as extended time, translated assessment, interpreters, etc.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional strategies and grade-level materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 
content areas and accelerate English language development are: 
•     Achieve 3000: Provides leveled texts and tiered questions that promotes critical thinking about a text and builds academic 
vocabulary. 
•     SMART board technology is used to make learning more interactive for students. 
•     Read Aloud/Think Aloud: Is used to guide students thinking about a text and allows the teacher to model fluency. 
•     Pre-teaching Vocabulary: Use of bilingual word wall, Vocabulary Study and Vocabulary Self-Collection strategy  
•     Visual Aids and Realia 
•     Accountable Talk 
•     AVID strategies: Quotation Analysis, Cornell Notes, Graphic Organizers 
The assistant principal, Ms. Blakley reviews students programs to make sure services indicated on the student's IEP are being 
met. 
Additionally, the IEP coordinator, Ms. Strycharz and the ENL teacher, Ms. Miller collaborate to ensure that these students are 
being appropriately and effectively accommodated.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The goal for ELL-SWD students at Digital Tech is to endure equitable standards-based ENL educational services for culturally 
and linguistically diverse special education students and their families.  Instruction for ELL-SWD students includes: 
•     Use of the Common core Learning Standards as the base for ENL, ELA and content area instruction in the least restrictive 
environment 
•     Increase use of multi-cultural materials and resources 
•     Use of instructional and adaptive technology 
•     ICT classes and ESL push-in model in content area courses 
•     Ongoing professional development and collaboration between the ENL teacher and special education teachers for best 
instructional practice for both ELLs and students with disabilities 
•     On going review of students’ IEP goals and ATS data to inform instruction and appropriate scaffolds and differentiation 
The SIT team, Ms. Blakley, Ms. Strycharz and Ms. Seltzer Bianco meets and discusses the needs of all students.  The team 
ensures that Digital Tech to meet the mandates of the students' IEPs.  We provide flexible programming to ensure students 
needs are being met.

For the 2017-2018 school year, Digital Tech will implement a more structured and strategic plan for intervention specifically for 
Long Term and Developing ELLs.  The plan will involve consistent and close collaboration between the school leader, ENL 
teacher, parent coordinator and content area teachers.  The ENL teacher will consistently work with the parent coordinator to 
increase parent outreach and involvement in the target students’ language development.  The ENL teacher will provide 
students with an after school course specifically designed to offer further support for students in courses for which they need 
to pass a regents exam to graduate.  This support will involve developing students’ academic language in that course, 
developing writing skills by referring to student-friendly rubrics and developing speaking skills using the Accountable Talk 
protocol.  It is our goal to have these target groups test-out of ENL as well as pass their regents exams.  It is also our goal to 
help students feel more confident about participating in class activities that involve speaking and listening to peers.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

At this time, there are no programs or services that will be discontinued for ELLs.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At Digital Tech, we have created enrichment and extra-curricular activities to further engage all of our students.  Our extra 
curricular activities include: Student Government, BRIC, NYU Advisors, AVID, OneGoal, Peer tutoring, Yearbook Committee and 
various clubs created and facilitated by teachers.  ELLs receive information about these activities explicitly from the ENL 
teacher who also acts as an adviser to encourage students to participate in at least one activity that interests them.  Our target 
ENL students are provided with a period 9 class that uses small group instruction to provide students with further support in 
their content area courses.  Ms. Miller, the ENL teacher provides students with fliers to invite them to school clubs and 
events.  The invitations are provided in the native language when necessary.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
•     Achieve 3000: Provides leveled texts and tiered questions that promotes critical thinking about a text and builds academic 
vocabulary. 
•     SMART board technology is used to make learning more interactive for students. 
•     Bilingual Glossaries, Longman English Dictionary 
•     Document Camera (ELMO): used to project graphic organizers and texts 
•     Lap tops and IPads: used to measure student lexile level 
•     Bilingual digital math curriculum 
•     Brain POP and Duolingo 
Textbook components provided in native language 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in Digital Tech's ENL program through the use of bilingual glossaries and bilingual word 
walls.  Newcomer and SIFE students are paired with a student who is literate in that students’ home language during class 
activities, which will help the student continue to develop their home language as well as make the material comprehensible.

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

At Digital Tech, our classes are grouped heterogeneously, which promotes differentiated instruction.  As a staff we collaborate 
to make sure that all services and resources provided to students correspond to the students’ ages, grade level and proficiency 
level.  For example, teacher will create leveled/ varied texts so that students can access content. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
•     Achieve 3000: Provides leveled texts and tiered questions that promotes critical thinking about a text and builds academic 
vocabulary. 
•     SMART board technology is used to make learning more interactive for students. 
•     Bilingual Glossaries, Longman English Dictionary 
•     Document Camera (ELMO): used to project graphic organizers and texts 
•     Lap tops and IPads: used to measure student lexile level 
•     Bilingual digital math curriculum 
•     Brain POP and Duolingo 
Textbook components provided in native langauge  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In order to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the year, a school leader facilitates a new student orientation in 
late August.  The school leader and parent coordinator present all the opportunities students will have at Digital Tech including 
extra curricular activities such as clubs and sports teams.  The ENL teacher will coordinate a mentorship program in which a 
newly enrolled ELL student will be paired with a peer mentor (preferably a peer who speaks the students’ home language) who 
will provide the student with information about the school and help the student feel welcome.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Spanish as our foreign language elective.  When we have enough students, we plan to implement a Native Language 
Arts elective class.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable.   
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As of the 2016-2017 school year and as per the requirements of CR-Part 154.2, ELL personnel at Digial Arts and Cinema 
Technology High School will receive ELL-specific professional development at off-campus workshops and training.  The ENL 
teacher will turnkey the information learned at the workshop or training to the staff.  As mandated by CR-Part 154.2, 50% of 
the ENL teacher’s professional development will be ELL specific.  Additionally, the Data Inquiry team will turnkey their review 
of ELL performance on content area assessments.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

At Digital Tech, teachers of ELLs will work collaboratively with the ENL teacher to support ELLs as they engage in the Common 
Core Learning Standards.  The ENL teacher will meet weekly with grade teams during common planning time to support 
teachers in developing activities and using strategies that will best support ELLs in meeting standards.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  The ENL teacher and the staff will discuss individual student needs as they transition including appropriate programming and 
additional support students may need in their high school courses (i.e. resources, learning style consideration, etc.)  
As of the 2016-2017 school year, Digital Tech will meet the professional development requirements of CR-Part 154.2 by: 
•     Having the ENL teacher turnkey training in strategies and best practices for supporting ELLs to the staff.  Of the staff’s 
yearly professional development, at least 15% will focus on integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. 
•     The ENL teacher will attend workshops or training on best practices for supporting ELLs.  Of the ENL teacher’s yearly 
professional development, at least 50% will be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction for ELLs. 
Teachers participated in learning appropriate instructional strategies and modifications to help ELLs access content area 
material.  Teachers were shows examples of how to appropriately differentiate assessments to determine ELLs knowledge of 
content.  Teachers learned ways to incorporate building academic language into their daily planning and instruction.  Some of 
the strategies teachers learned were how to use and differentiate AVID strategies in their instruction. 
Ms. Guinta, the People Personnel Secretary will store agendas and attendance to make sure Digital Tech reaches the CR- Part 
154.2 mandates.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At Digital Tech, the ENL teacher works closely with the parent coordinator to support and reach out to parents of ELLs.  The 
ENL teacher will contact parents or guardians of ELLs via phone to schedule annual individual meetings (in addition to regularly 
schedules Parent Teacher Conferences and Parent Information Night).  The ENL teacher will arrange for an in-person 
interpreter or an interpreter via phone conferences (as needed).  The ENL teacher will keep a portfolio of student work as well 
as track assessment data to record and determine a students’ language development progress, language proficiency 
assessment results and students’ needs.  The ENL teacher will share this data with the parent/guardian of the student and 
explain how the ENL program at Digital Tech will help to support and enrich the child’s language acquisition.  The ENL teacher 
will also ask at least two content area teacher (preferably a course in which the child has shown the most improvement in or 
still struggles with) be part of the meeting with the parent so that the parent/guardian will be informed of their child’s 
progress and needs in that course.  We will use the DOE interpretation services. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At the beginning of the school year, parents will participate in an Initial Parent Orientation, which offers parents the 
opportunity to learn about our school and the programs it offers.  During this initial meeting, we inform parents of the services 
mandated by the state that will be provided to their child as well as the three program choices.  Parents will be provided with 
important documentation and information in their home language and will be given the opportunity to ask clarifying questions 
or express concerns.  We will use interpretation services to ensure that all parent voices are heard.  An ELL Parent Conference 
will be conducted in the spring prior to the administration of standardized exams to review strategies parents can use at home 
to help their child prepare for the exams.  This year we will hold parent workshops (bi-monthly) that will encourage parents 
and guardians to participate and organize school events.  The Parent Coordinator will ensure that all event fliers are sent home 
to parents of ELLs in their preferred language and will also collaborate with the ENL teacher to reach out to parents to ensure 
they have the opportunity to attend school events.  We will use DOE interpretation services.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dawn Meconi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

For current students we use the Adult Preferred Language Report from ATS (RAPL) and for new students we use 
the DOE Parent/Guardian Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). We enter parent program preferences on 
the ELPC screen on ATS. Emergency contacts for students are listed on the blue cards collected in the main office. 
Report updated regularly with parent language preference. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
