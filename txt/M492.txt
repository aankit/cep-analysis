Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 
The primary mission of the High School for Law, Advocacy & Community Justice is to create a climate that promotes 
excellence in learning. Our goal is that students will develop into persons who are intelligent, critical thinkers, and 
supportive members of the communities. This is accomplished by everyone working collaboratively to meet the needs 
of students within the confines of a smaller, more personal learning atmosphere. We develop a special culture from 
the onset that celebrates success with high expectations for students as well as adults. The students will be immersed 
in the study, inquiry, and advocacy of law, requiring their involvement in community service, thus enabling them to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

realize their individual potential throughout the greater community. Our hope is that students view themselves as 
pioneers of the new millennium, and we expect them to be counted among the great success stories of tomorrow. 
  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The staff, parents and students have been involved in a series of conversations around assessing the current state of 
the school and setting a direction for its short-and long-term development. The substance of these conversations 
have ranged from increasing familiarity with the CCLS and citywide instructional expectations, to a review of what our 
current data tells us about students’ achievement in our school, to discussing desired characteristics of our 
classrooms and implications for teaching and how we can increase the quantity and quality of parent involvement. 
Our school goals were set in the context of these conversations, and the CEP is a reflection of their outcomes. The 
various constituencies involved, and the formats of the meetings in which these conversations were held are as 
follows: 

1. SLT: During SLT meetings, the CEP was developed and new goals were set for this year. These goals 
represent the voices of all constituencies and were informed by discussions with students, parents and 
teachers.  
2. During bi-monthly faculty meetings, department meetings, Circular 6 meetings, and PD days, staff and 
school leaders work to further develop goals, work towards meeting them and review student performance 
data in order to get some insight into whether or not their strategies show promise. 
3. During periodic student assemblies, and weekly student council meetings, student leaders also give 
feedback regarding the effectiveness of school practices and work with school staff to identify improvements 
and areas of concern for attention. 
4. During PTA Meetings and Parent-Teacher Conferences, parents are given opportunities to give direct 
feedback to teachers and school leaders regarding school goals, strategies and practices. 

The CEP includes feedback from all these constituents, and will continue to develop as the school grows. 

With an average English proficiency of 2.3 and an average math proficiency of 2.2 more than 85% of our students 
graduate each year with a college acceptance letter in hand. From day one we instill in students and parents that we 
hold high expectations for each student and it is expected that every student will strive towards becoming College 
Ready within a 4-year period. Although it is not a requirement each student is expected to take four years of math, 
four years of science, and a College Prep course (College Summit)-this includes Students with Disabilities (SWD’s) and 
ELLs (English Language Learners), and we expect all students to work towards acquiring an Advanced Regents 
diploma.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 20% of our population consists of students with disabilities. We service push-in and pull-out SETSS and 
ICT. Over the last 3 school years we have continued to see an increase in the number of ICT students. We are still 
struggling to find teachers that hold a dual license in special education and a content area. Content knowledge of a 
push-in ICT teacher is critical in increasing achievement levels for SWD's. We have been very successful in moving 
students from Self-contained classroom settings to less restrictive ICT classes. We continue to work closely with this 
population of students to increase scholarship levels and Regents level diplomas as well as college and career 
readiness.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Over the last two years we have made great strides in: 

-Improving our Regents passing rate in College Readiness Courses. 

-We have increased the number of Advanced Placement courses from 5 classes to 7 classes which include AP English 
Literature, AP Spanish, AP Environmental Studies, AP World Studies, AP Psychology, AP Computer Science Principles & 
AP US History.  

-We established a competitive Debate Team that placed four of our students in the top 5% in the overall citywide 
competition. With this new notoriety, students have been requesting placement in our school to compete in teh 
Debate team.  

 

-Our school survey illustrated gains in Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership and 
Trust. 

 

We will continue to build on the gains we made during the last school year as we build on strategies that were 
successful and continue to develop and implement new ideas as we gain information from the data we gather. 

 

Data Sources: Learning Environment Survey, Regents Results and College Board AP scores. 

 

Our key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year are: 

 

-Increase the level of rigorous instruction across all subjects to increase the number of students that are college ready 
by graduation. We will also add additional College Now courses and an additional AP course. 

-Additional class time to improve reading and math levels: Struggling with low reading and math levels we need 
additional instructional time to meet the needs of our students. After collaborating with parents, students, teachers 
and network personnel we decided to expand our teaching periods to 1-hour long. We now operate on a trimester 
schedule and classes are 1-hour long. Teachers teach 4-periods per day as opposed to five. Additionally, all 9 th grade 
students take a double period of English and a double period of math each trimester. This additional time in English 
and Math class allows us the opportunity to build vocabulary , literacy and math fluency skills that are transferable 
across all subjects.  

-Building a strong foundation for 9th grade students: All 9th grades students are scheduled to take a Humanities class 
that focuses on academic as well as social skills. Students learn: time management, organizational skills, study skills, 
annotation skills, research skills, Respect for ALL strategies, pros and cons of social media, development of self-
esteem and how to handle bullying/cyber-bulling. They also learn about support groups that are available and the 
importance of involvement in school activities and sports as they build their resume with a focus on a 4-year college.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Standards establish the levels of performance that students, teachers, and schools are expected to meet. To succeed, 
and meet the level of College readiness, all students will need to perform to high standards and acquire mastery of 
rigorous core subject material. All students will also need to gain the cognitive and social skills that enable them to 
deal with complex challenges. It is essential that a full range of content and skills be integrated explicitly into 
standards, assessments, curriculum, instruction, professional development and the learning environment. 

 

During the 2017-2018 school year every teacher at LACJ received professional development in the area of CCLS. The 
results are unit plans and assessments that are rigorous and aligned to the CCLS and are modified to meet the needs 
of SWD’s and ELL’s. We pride ourselves on the fact that all our students, including ELL’s and SWD’s, have access to the 
same curriculum and are held to the same level of expectations as the general education students. With the 
collaboration of special education teachers and general education teachers we are able to provide differentiated 
instruction that includes multiple entry points. By using a variety of instructional strategies and resources to respond 
to student’s diverse learning strengths, needs, and prior background knowledge, teachers offer more than one entry 
point into the curriculum making the complexity and depth of any subject matter accessible to a range of students. 
Our cycle of inquiry provides the avenue to: continuously look at student work with a lens to surface the gap between 
where students are and where we would like them to be, consistently review formative and summative data to 
inform instruction, and make modifications to instruction and assessments to meet the academic needs of our 
students. We pride ourselves on the fact that all our students, including ELL’s and SWD’s, have access to the same 
curriculum and are held to the same level of expectations. 

 

Data Trends: Our English regents scores as well as Advanced Placement scores have continued to increase each year. 
Our biggest increase this year was in our level of Mastery on the English Regents which speaks to an increase in the 
area of College and Career Readiness . We have also seen a consistent increase in the number of students enrolled in 
College Now courses and the number of students achieving grades of "B" or higher in those college courses.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Strengths: Unit plans and curriculum maps, across all subjects, are aligned to the CCLS and emphasize rigorous habits 
and higher-order skills. Based upon a constant analysis of data from multiple sources unit plans are consistently 
revised and updated to meet the needs of our students. 

 

Priority Need: 

-Ensure that curricula and tasks consistently provide supports for the lowest level students as well as provide 
extensions for the higher level students. 

-Ensure vertical and horizontal alignment/connections within common subject areas 

 

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

By June 2019, we will effectively increase the level of rigor across math classes, as evidenced by a 3% increase in 
the average number of students demonstrating college readiness on the Algebra CC math Regents exam from 
50% to 53%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

We are committed to working collaboratively with parents, teachers and students, to improve student achievement 
and ensure that every child graduates from high school prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, 
critically thinking adult. Our class periods are 1 hour in duration so that students have the opportunity to engage with 
the content to improve understanding of the content and to improve core skills. In the classroom teachers instruct 
students to conduct close reading of texts, design questions to assess understanding and push thinking, and engage 
students in writing and discussion around the content. 

-Our PPT team meets bi-monthly to discuss students who are struggling academically and/or behaviorally, and/or 
have attendance issues. During these meetings we design action plans to address the student’s individual issues and 
follow up bi-monthly or sooner on the student’s progress and take further action if/when needed. During these 
meetings we also discuss school wide trends in the areas of academics, behavior and attendance and how to best 
address these trends (ex. high failure rate of ICT students and avoidant behavior/attention seeking behavior many of 
our students express). 

-Case-Conferencing is another tool we employ regularly to support our students. If a student is struggling 
academically, behaviorally, or is facing a personal or social issue we hold a case conference where the student is 
present as well as his/her teachers/guidance counselor, dean and other related support staff depending of the issue. 
During these meetings an action plan is designed with the student and parent to best help the student succeed in 
school and if additional help is needed (counseling, evaluation, conduct sheet) that is put into place as well. 

-Crisis Team is called upon when a student/family is facing personal issues that are impacting the student at school. 
The Crisis Team works with resources here in the school and out in the community to support the student and the 
family. 

 

Data Trends: 

-Our attendance has dropped slightly this year. We are currently reaching out to students/parents of incoming 
students who have demonstrated attendance issues in middle school. Focused meetings with these families will take 
place over the summer to proactively identify and resolve issues that could have caused attendance problems.  

-We tend to struggle with our LTA population, and SPED population in the area of attendance. Our attendance 
teacher and guidance counselors have made a concerted effort to make consistent outreach to the families of these 
students and involve outside agencies to combat family and social issues that impact attendance. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18 

 

-Our rate of student suspensions has decreased. Our most frequent occurrences tend to be verbal threats/cyber-
bullying. At the conclusion of a suspension we work with the student to address the issue(s) and to transition them 
back to their classes. Every student engages in a post-suspension guidance conference before being placed back in the 
classroom. 

 

Priority needs: 

 

-School culture is a major area of focus/concern: It is a core belief of ours that if students “want” to be here, if they 
feel supported and welcome, grades will improve and incidents will decrease. We are working toward creating a 
school wide environment of respect and rapport and encouraging and cultivating these interactions among students 
as well as working with the staff on how they respond and interact with students. Through advisories, introduction of 
more after-school clubs and activities, and the introduction of an after-school tutoring programs we are beginning to 
see progress in this area. 
-To increase communication with families and to increase parent participation we hired a full-time parent coordinator 
this year. 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On the School Quality Guide (2016-2017) our score for Collaborative teachers increased from 3.83 to 4.41. Teacher 
team work has resulted in established school-wide practices that have improved overall teacher ratings and student 
performance. Teachers utilize leadership roles in order to engage in peer-to-peer collaboration to improve pedagogy 
and student achievement. 

 

Teacher teams and distributive leadership are supported by various structures at LACJ. Our basic organization is the 
following: 

 

The school day has purposely been designed where all students in the school go the lunch at the same time during 4th 
period (11:00-11:45 AM)-this is the time when all circular 6 (C6) meetings take place. Having all teachers available at 
the same time allows us flexibility in the configurations of our teacher teams. Circular 6 time is, with the exception of 
a few positions, entirely devoted to team work and co-planning. Each department has a team leader. Teachers belong 
to a grade-level team and a department team. Grade-level teams and department teams meet during designated 
times. All teams follow a cycle of inquiry and provide administrators with weekly C6 minutes to keep us abreast of 
what is happening during these meetings. 

 

 

Administrators meet with grade-level teams weekly. During these meetings, team leaders and teachers share work 
and also provide feedback about department and/or grade-level needs. In this way, professional development needs 
are identified. For example, the agenda for the Nov 4th PD Day was agreed on and workshops developed to meet the 
prioritized needs expressed during these meetings. By working collaboratively with supervisors, teacher teams can 
influence and help shape the professional work of the school while maintaining a coherent direction towards common 
school goals. 

Data Trends: 

Teacher teams also spend a good deal of time interpreting data. Teachers use various forms of data to inform and 
improve student achievement. With common formative and summative assessments we are able to depict trends and 
patterns across class, subject and grade levels. For example, common end-of-units assessments allow teachers to 
analyze results by content and skill and provide targeted instruction accordingly. Students are provided with student 
feedback sheets at the end of each unit that delineate progress by specific skills and standards. Data trends 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

demonstrate that over the past two years we have continued to increase the passing percentage on the majority of 
Regents Examinations and our Advanced Placement examinations. 

 

Over the last 2 years we have continued to see an increase in teacher practice as evidenced by increases in 
performance in the Danielson rubric in the following components: questioning, assessment and student engagement 
we have also decrease the number of teachers on teacher improvement plans from 4 to 0. 

 

Priority need: 

Our priority is to improve collaboration and communication between general education and special education 
teachers that co-teach. In-turn this will work towards increasing the overall scholarship rate of our special education 
students in our ICT classes (Integrated co-teaching). Trends show that the scholarship rate for these students tend to 
slag behind the general education students. 

 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 

By June 2019, teacher teams will collaboratively analyze student performance to develop targeted supports, as 
evidenced by a 2% increase in SWD's scoring at or above passing rate on all Regents Exams.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

On the School Quality Guide (2016-2017) the score for Effective Leadership increased from 2.98 to 3.75. 

As School leaders the Danielson Rubric serves as our guide to improve and refine teacher pedagogy. The Danielson 
Framework forms the basis of conversation during the Initial Planning Conferences, and throughout the observation 
cycles. At the beginning of the year school leaders and teachers review observations from the previous year and 
choose components from Danielson that they would like to develop and/or refine. The Initial Planning Conference 
focuses on movement from one level of the rubric to the next, and components to develop are jointly selected by 
teachers and supervisors.  
With the Danielson Framework as a guide and with knowledge of our students’ academic needs we developed our 
instructional focus: 

- Close-reading with guided questions 
- Writing with a focus 
- High cognitive, Critical thinking questions 
- Ground reading, writing and discussion with evidence from text 
- Social Learning/Student Engagement 

Working towards highly effective practices is rooted in creating opportunities for students to build proficiency in 
analysis, reasoning, argumentation, proof and interpretation of increasingly complex materials. A focus on precision 
and accuracy underlies these proficiencies, and we work to instill in students a sense of intellectual openness and 
curiosity so that our students may be equally interested in identifying problems as they become proficient in solving 
them. Classroom practices aligned to these beliefs manifest themselves in classroom practices in the following ways: 
● In classroom discussions, students are routinely asked to provide evidence that support their assertions, to 
counter an opposing view, and/or to provide reasoning for their position. 
● Teachers work to approach content in ways that engage and interest students 
● Students are asked to interpret, to predict, and/or to hypothesize. 
● The complexity of the content increases as students move through the grade levels. 

 

Data: 

We have concluded through learning walks, classroom observations, a review of assessments, and the data in 
Advance that teachers need to improve in Questioning and Discussion and Assessment. Improvement in these areas 
will result in more student engagement and participation and student acquisition of knowledge and skills. It will also 
result in aligning assessment to targeted learning objectives. Although data indicates that from June 2016-June 2017 
we made improvements in this area we would like to continue with the momentum we have built.  
From June 2016 through June 2017, as indicated by Danielson ratings, teachers demonstrated progress in the 
following components: Questioning, Student Engagement and Assessment. 
As of June 2017 we reduced the number of teachers on teacher improvement plans from four to zero.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28 

 

Priority-To build teacher capacity in developing Depth of Knowledge Questions that lead to inquiry and student-led 
discussion.To strengthen alignment between student learning objectives and assessment. To continue to build 
student capacity to delve deeper into the text and clearly articulate evidence to support their claims.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

By June 2019, school leaders will build teachers' capacity to use differentiated questioning and discussion

course/student expectations and up to data academic information via Pupil path. 

3. Based on survey information the School Leadership Team will collaborate with the PTA and school leaders to 
conduct monthly meetings to: inform and educate parents about the various ways they can become engaged in the 
school and support their son/daughter, familiarize and educate parents on what rigorous instruction looks like, 
provide guidance on what each parent should be doing at home to support and reinforce what is happening at the 
school level and reinforce the importance of ongoing and constant communication with teachers and school

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Improving strong family and community ties is one of the initiatives we chose to put a strong focus on last year. After 
conducting an analysis of parent involvement and community ties, we determined that we would make a concerted 
effort to not only increase parent involvement but to also to increase the quality of programs, workshops, and 
teacher interactions with parents. As a result of collaboration with SLT, Parent Association, guidance counselors and 
teachers our goal is to implement the following: 

  An open house for incoming students to familiarize new students and parents with school and campus 

policies, school curriculum, Advanced Placement and Honors classes, electives, Law classes, trimester course 
sequence of the school, etc. 

  Grade level assemblies and grade-level parent meetings to introduce resources and programs that are grade 

specific such as Humanities class for 9th grade students, Advisory for 10th grade students, College Summit for 
11th and 12th grade students.  

  Curriculum nights for parents at the beginning of each year to allow parents to see life through the eyes of 
their son/daughter. Parents will follow their child's schedule and visit each class for 20 minutes-the bell will 
ring to signify the change of classes. Teachers will familiarize parents with the curriculum, pacing calendar, 
assessment schedule, and required readings and projects for the school year. 
In collaboration with parent conduct a Celebration and Awards Ceremony every trimester. 

 
  Case-conferences for at-risk students. Conference will include teachers, administration, guidance counselor 

and parent coordinator. 
Introduce parents to extra-curricular events and sports teams and encourage parent participation. 

 
  Personal phone calls to parents for invitations to monthly PA meetings, family get-togethers, field trips, and 

scheduling of Parent Teacher Conferences. 

  Partnership with St. Luke’s to promote emotional well-being and mental health of students and their families. 
  Based of feedback from parent surveys conduct workshops based on need. 
  Teacher provide up-to-date information regarding academics and attendance on PupilPath so parents and 

students can have constant access to student information and progress. 

Data trends: 

 

NYC school survey shows a slight decrease in Strong family ties from the 2016 to the 2017 school year.  

 

Priority: To increase the quantity and quality of parent involvement.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  

By June 2019, we will deepen our partnership with families, as evidenced by a 5% increase in parents who 
attend workshops and parent meetings, from 27% to 32%.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
There is ongoing and collaborative work around aligning standards, curricula and assessments. The work of our 
department teams is centered around defining what we teach, how we assess what we teach, and how we can use 
these assessments to make some determination of our effect on student achievement. For example, 

● Base-line assessments are administered at the beginning of the year in every subject. This information is 
used as a starting point to inform instruction and gauge individual student’s strengths and weaknesses. 
Additionally, each 9 th grade teacher is provided with a copy of their student’s NYSED Student Report that 
indicates math and English scale scores, performance levels and content standards. 
● At the start of the school year teacher teams conduct an item analysis of the previous Regents Exam to 
assess student knowledge of content and skills. This information is used to modify current unit plans and 
assessments.  
● In developing assessments a Table of Specification is used to ensure assessments are aligned to the CCLS as 
well as ensuring that questions are allocated across the DOK spectrum. This process ensures that all essential 
standards are assessed as well as assessing various levels of rigor.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● In all subjects, end-of-unit exams are uniform so that teachers are able to analyze data for their class and 
across the grade. The findings from the analysis are used in teacher team meetings to analyze trends among 
each class and grade to inform unit planning, modifications to instruction and determine next steps.  
● Teacher teams consistently analyze data from classroom assessments and end-of-unit assessments to 
create a picture of individual students’ strengths and weaknesses, determine level of scaffolding, determine 
student groupings and identify areas that need additional focus. This information is used to modify future 
units and to inform daily instruction.  
● After each end-of-unit assessment each student is given an individualized student feedback sheet that 
informs the student how well they mastered each standard as well as how well they performed on each 
specific skill. Each student is now armed with specific information detailing what areas he/she must focus on 
to become proficient and eventually reach the level of mastery.  

Additionally, the focus on the use of rubrics and review of student work informs ongoing formative assessment in the 
classroom and aids in helping students build capacity to self-assess and peer-assess. Teachers use a variety of 
techniques for ongoing assessment, including exit slips, homework checks, use of student writing as exemplars and 
use of student test analysis to build understanding of expectations, notebook checks, classroom questioning, student 
surveys and conferencing.  
This ongoing professional work across all departments is an integral part of the professional culture at our school. To 
inform their work, teachers review curricular materials from city, state and national sources. Teachers here strive to 
find multiple ways to assess their own effectiveness in order to move students to higher levels of achievement. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. LACJ , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support 
of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, 
Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

LACJ will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

To increase parent participation at the Parent Association meetings and school activities by implementing multiple 
methods of communication. 

● A newsletter at the end of each trimester will be sent to parents. 
● The PA agenda will be sent a week before each meeting. 
● At least two phone blasts will be sent prior to each event to inform parents about school activities before 
they occur. 
● Flyers will be sent home to promote events.  
● School Website communications.  
● PupilPath to keep parents informed of academic performance, behavior, and attendance. providing 
materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,

and decision making in support of the education of their children; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 
● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the 
school year; 
● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-
Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 
● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

  

 

 

LACJ , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded 
by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share 
responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 Our school uses data from the NYSITELL exam, NYSESLAT exams , uniform unit assessments, in-class assessment of the 4 
modalities as well as teacher created assessments to assess the literacy skills of our ELL students.  Our ELL population tend to 
not be literate in their own language which effects their English literacy skill development.  The data shows that vocabulary 
acquisition is essential to literacy skill building.  Students are emersed with the English language in all of their content area 
classes.  This helps our students to develop their English skills in all 4 modalities as well as communication skills in English. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Use of DDC in Pupil to keep track of data to illustrate areas of strength and areas of weakness. Each end-of-unit is analyzed to 
generate student feedback and determine next steps. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Paste response to question here:   We use scholarship reports, Regents data and data from the NYSESLAT Exams to evaluate 
our ELL program and to plan for next steps to improve our program. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ELL teacher, Mr. O'Donnell meets with the administration to put action plans in place to address student skill/content area 
deficits. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:  n/a  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data shows that most of our student do progress in levels especially in the speaking component.  Over the past few 
years,  more students have scored Proficient on the NYSESLAT exam.  The data reveals that our ELL students struggle with their 
reading and writing skills.  Poor reading comprehension leads to poor writing in pieces that require textual evidence and 
analysis.  Reading and writing skills are necessary in all subject areas, however the type of reading and writing skills 
differ.  Students struggle with academic specific reading and writing tasks.  Our students struggle with academic vocabulary 
skills and analysis skills this effects course and Regents Exam grades.  The NYSESLAT and NYSITELL Exams show that reading 
and writing are the skills we need to foucs on with our ELL population. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Student feedback sheets aligned to rubric and progress reports. The ELL teacher, Mr. O'Donnell and the supervising A.P., Ms. 
Muscolino meet with teacher teams to discuss the data and data analysis.  They share strategies and plans to address the 
content/skill deficits. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  SL instruction is aligned to NYS Learning Standards for English as a Second Language which include Common Core 
State Standards for each grade level. All of our ESL instruction is self-contained. Student are programmed by grade 
not by proficiency level.  Teachers use texts, textbooks (Shining Star, Cause and Effect),  reader- writer notebooks, 
leveled/abridged fiction, dictionaries, glossaries, internet (including a large projection screen), laptops, Rosetta Stone 
software, audio/visual devices such as SmartBoards, Elmo, graphic organizers, pictures, manipulatives, music, posters, 
maps, primary documents and much of the above generated by students. ESL classroom teachers use ESL strategies 
such as the Point of Entry Model; Content-Based ESL, which uses content as a means to give students English skills; 
and Balanced Literacy, which includes interactive writing, guided reading and writers’ workshop to deliver academic 
content area instruction and provides additional support for our students. Classrooms are print-rich, employing word 
walls, in-class libraries and publicizing student work. As per CR Part 154, the native language is used 25% of the time 
to access students’ transferable skills. Academic rigor is valued and expected.  A fully certified ESL teachers provide 
supplemental instruction to ELLs. This supplemental instruction includes a 45-minute tutorial each week (period 4) to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

support ELLs by reinforcing work from regular classes, helping with vocabulary in homework assignments and acting 
as liaisons to the mainstream teachers in articulating academic difficulties experienced by the students. The teacher 
employs various manipulatives to aid students to attend to decoding and message-making skills to build literacy. 
Native language materials such as books, newspapers and CDs are available in classroom and campus libraries.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 All instruction is aligned is aligned to the Common Core ELA curriculum.  All ESL students are programmed in a 2-hour block 
class where the ELA content is delivered.  This block corresponds to the same pacing calendar as our general-ed ELA classes. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Students are tracked through their content area subjects by the ESL teachers. Content area teachers are given support and 
materials to scaffold content for ELLs. Examples of these supports include leveled content texts, word walls, native language 
texts and alternative assessments. ESL teachers also provide information about cultural differences and learning styles of ELLs. 
Teachers have common planning time to discuss students, student data and strategies for success, particularly with regard to 
SIFE, Special Education ELLs and long-term ELLs.  homework help is programmed and matched to facilitate specific content 
needs. All students take electives in content-rich and experiential art, forensics and constitutional law classes. Effectiveness of 
instruction is assessed by classroom instruments, teacher and student self-assessments as well as standardized tests such as 
the ELA and subject area Regents and the NYSESLAT, both of which are addressed explicitly through Regents and NYSESLAT 
prep lessons and a general “test sophisticated” classroom culture. Teachers use Datacation and SESIS to access program-wide 
data on student performance.We base instruction primarily on grade-level Common Core Standards and differentiate among 
ELL subgroups according to English proficiency level, academic preparedness and years of service. All lessons are differentiated 
through teacher-student conferences, graphic organizers, leveled texts, use of the native language and alternative 
assessments.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:   Long-term ELLs typically struggle with graduation and Regents requirements. Many are 
under-credit and overage 11th and 12th graders. We are therefore particularly concerned with their completion of a four-year 
graduation. Teachers differentiate instruction to address long-term ELLs’ needs. We also offer these students peer-to-peer 
mentoring, PM school, homework help and Regents task attack strategies. We also partner closely with guidance counselors 
and the college advisor as these staff members work closely with students on students’ plans for graduation and beyond.   All 
of the 12th grade students complete the college application process and participate in College Access for All, a program that 
assists students with college selection and the application and financial aid process.  We feel that this is a good leverage point 
for these students. A college-going culture is maintained and bolstered for long-term ELLs. Castle Learning is used to support 
test prep and assist teachers with assessing content area skills and knowledge. Students are made to understand that the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

same standards and expectations are in effect for them as for other ELLs.  A college-going culture is maintained and bolstered 
for ESL and ESL/SPED students.Special Education students are programmed into period 8th period and/or resource room. The 
ESL and resource teachers inter-visit and debrief students’ needs and progress. Students receive instruction and intervention 
according to their language and academic needs with regard to learning style, personal interests, and all information contain in 
the IEP.  The ESL teacher contributes to, reads and maintains on file IEPs for all Special Education ELLs. Special Education ELL 
students fulfill the same standards and expectations as all ELLs. A college-going culture is maintained and bolstered for Special 
Education ELLs.Former ELL's are tracked by their guidance counelor to make sure they are succeeding in general education 
classes.  If need be, tutoring is set-up to support their learning needs.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here: All students including ELL's follow our hortizontal aligment of curriculum.  Alternate texts, 
modified texts, and supplemental texts are used to support ELL students.  Students are tracked through their content area 
subjects by the ESL teachers. Content area teachers are given support and materials to scaffold content for ELLs. Examples of 
these supports include leveled content texts, word walls, native language texts, nylon graphic organizers, sentence strips, 
glossaries, dictionaries, scaffolded text for formal assessments and alternative assessments with extended time and 
translation. ESL teachers also provide information about cultural differences and learning styles of ELLs. Teachers have 
common planning time to discuss students, student data and strategies for success, particularly with regard to SIFE, Special 
Education ELLs and long-term ELLs.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All ELL and Special Eduation ELA classes follow the same curriculum, however these student receive modifications based on 
their IEP such as extended time, separate location, questions read aloud.  Students are also given an additioanl 8th  period 
Resource Room if determined at the IEP meeting and in the IEP to help achieve established goals and English proficiency.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELL teachers meet daily with ELA teachers to collaborate in aligning the curriculum and texts. Our focus is on student writing, 
particularly identifying relevant themes and generating cogent theses from them.  In all of the ELA classes the teachers follow 
the same grade level curriculum and unit plans with modifications made where appropriate, such as modified texts and 
extended unit time. Students are given the same periodic assessments. We use the information from the assessments to drive 
instruction. It is important that our ELL students are held to the same standards as the rest of the student body since they 
must pass the English Regents Exam in order to graduate.    As with ELA, ELLs are expected to follow the same Common Core 
Curriculum as general education students. To aid them with this effort, ELLs are grouped together with a dedicated social 
studies, math and science teacher. Their content classes, while reaching the same skills and performance indicators as general 
education classes, are scaffolded for learner language and programmed for extended time. Grouping ELLs together for these 
content area classes allows teachers to see patterns of misunderstanding and areas for focus. It also allows for native language 
use and risk-taking in a low stress environment for the ELL.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Targeted Regents preparation as an additional pull-out for 11th and 12th grade ELL students.  Using end of unit data more 
efficiently to inform instruction.  Also to include more speaking and listening tasks on unit assessments.

Policy and Reference Guide, I, Doreen Conwell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting.

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Home Language Survey and the Parental Choice survey are mandatory documents that must be completed. Once 
the documents are completed the student and parent/guardian are interviewed by the Guidance Counselor. The 
information regarding home language is entered into ATS. As needed, written and oral communication is 
translated to parents. If we do not have a staff member in the school to provide the translation, a translator or 
translation is requested from the translation unit at central.
