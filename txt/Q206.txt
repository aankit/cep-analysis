Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 206 The Horace Harding School is an elementary school that is located in Rego Park, New York. We have adopted 
the nickname ”The Little Red Schoolhouse." We are truly the little red school house located directly on the service 
road off the eastbound Long Island Expressway. PS 206 The Horace Harding School has been in existence for sixty five 
years.. We are truly a community school. We are proud of the fact that generations of families have attended 
elementary school at PS 206 The Horace Harding School. Our school has a rich tradition of academic excellence and 
community in the heart of Rego Park, New York. 

Our school has a student population of 620 and growing. We are a pre-kindergarten-grade 5 school. Our school has an 
integrated co-teaching model for students with disabilities in grades Kindergarten - grade 5. We have three small 
special education classes that are designed to meet the needs of our special education students as per their 
Individualized Education Plan. We provide related services in the areas of speech and language therapy, occupational 
therapy, physical therapy and mandated guidance counseling services. 

The Rego Park area of New York is a melting pot of New York City. We are very proud of the diversity in our school 
building. We have approximately 180 students in our school who are English Language Learners. We implement the 
stand-alone English as a New Language (ENL) instructional model and the integrated co-teaching model based on the 
regulations of CR Part 154. The integrated co-teaching model emphasizes content with language function. Our school 
uses zero period from 8:05 pm to 8:35 pm for targeted support services for ELL (English Language Learners) in the 
area of guided reading and strategy reading groups. Our school also offers a Title III program for our ELL (English 
Language Learner) students after school from 2:20-5:00 Wednesday and Thursday. The focus of our Title III program is 
on our entering, emerging and transitioning ELLS (English Language Learners) in grades 2-5. Our diversity is what

students are engaged in weekly lessons in science, technology, theatre and visual arts. 

We have embraced a balanced literacy philosophy for students in K-5. Balanced Literacy encompasses all of the 
important aspects for the development of reading skills for all students. Our students participate in shared reading, 
read aloud, guided reading and independent reading during the Reading Workshop. Our units of study in literacy are 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. This methodology of teaching children to learn to read and write is 
evidence-based for literacy instruction in grades K-5. Our students in K-2 are provided an opportunity to naturally 
develop as readers through teacher created units from rich literature and research based methodology. Our K-2 
students are engaged in phonics through Fundations and Sadlier and drastic sight word instruction. They are all 
matched to "Just Right Books" to improve their reading proficiency through guided reading complimented with text 
complexity. Our students in grades 3-5 are immersed in a Balanced Literacy philosophy that uses the resource of 
Ready Gen to support their learning. In addition, teachers have created new units with rich literature as a response to 
our student data. Our students in grades 3-5 also work with their teacher in guided reading and strategy groups. They 
are matched to "Just Right Books" to ensure that they improve their proficiency. Word work and vocabulary

Newsletter. Our school became a CookShop school during the 2017-2018 school year. We will continue partnering 
with the New York Food Bank to bring CookShop to grades Pre-kindergarten-grade 2 for the 2018-2019 school year.  

At PS 206, we are very proud of the positive learning environment that is evident the moment you enter our school. 
We use a Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) program as a behavior management system that 
rewards students and improves student culture and climate. Our PBIS program is enhanced by the implementation of 
the PowerBrain and Sanford Harmony programs. In addition, our partnership with the New York City Department of 
Education's program Thrive which supports teachers, students and families in the area of mental wellness.  

Community service and giving back to the community is part of the culture of our school. Our student government is 
an active voice in our school community. They participate in different community projects such as City Harvest, Toys 
for Tots, Books and Pajamas by Scholastic. Our school also participates in the WE program which is a global 
partnership to grow leaders in our schools who will help to make our world a better place. During the Fall, our school 
participates in the Heavenly Hats Parade which is dedicated to raising funds to purchase hats for children and adults 
who are being treated for cancer. Our school Gardening Club has made the landscape of our school which rests in a 
very urban setting truly magical.

Our school hosts two after school programs. The first program is the Queens Central Y M & YWHA program which is 
state funded through 21st Century. This is program for 150 students in grades K-5 from October 2018-May 2019. Our 
second program is through Thinking Caps. This is a program for a fee for students in pre-kindergarten-grade 5. Both 
programs highlight academic support and homework help as well as enrichment activities through the arts. 

The Parent Coordinator works closely with the Administration and the officers of the Parent's Association Executive 
Board to increase parent engagement. Parents participate in Meet the Teacher Night, Bagels with the Principal 
events, Middle School Information Sessions, Nutrition Workshops, Cookshop Workshops, Safety Workshops,. Working 
Lab Sessions on completing Lunch Forms and opening their student school account, Daddy Doughnut Day, Family 
Bingo Night, Family Movie Night, Science Fair Week, Art Fair Week, Family Game Night, content area parent 
workshops, Internet Safety sessions, Preparing your Child for the NYS ELA and Math exams, English as a Second 
Language Family Support and more. Our school has a website ps206q.org which is up dated regularly with messages 
from the administration, advertising for upcoming events, helpful links and monthly up dates from each grade. Our 
families also use Remind as a way to stay connected to our school and what is taking place. 

Student teachers are the future of the education system. Providing a lab site for future teachers to work with 
experienced teachers to learn curriculum and grow in practice is a commitment that our school has made. We enjoy 
and welcome our partnerships with Queens College, St. John's University and Touro College. 

Based on the 2017-2018 Principal Practice Observation, an area of celebration for PS 206 is indicator (1.1) Curriculum, 
(1.3) Resources Allocation, and (1.4) Learning Environment. Our teacher teams meet weekly to work collaboratively 
during the school year. On Mondays they create curriculum maps in all subject areas to meet the needs of all learners. 
Teacher teams make adjustments to these maps throughout the school year based on student data, class data, grade 
data and school data. We are a Title I school but our resources and ability to do different things are challenging. We 
were able to secure grants to increase technology in our building and allow all students to have access to the internet 
and its resources. We also create a schedule that allows teachers to provide different interventions and enrichment 
for targeted students in the school. Our school community has been recognized for creating an environment of 
mutual trust and respect. This is evident in the many ongoing collaborations among our staff, parents and students 
alike. We have a safe and welcoming environment that provides the setting for student achievement, meeting 
students' social emotional needs and making the students sufficiently comfortable to take the academic risks required 
of them.  

Based on the 2017-2018 Principal Practice Observation, the areas for improvement are indicators (1.2) Pedagogy. 
Teachers will be trained in the use of different tools to bring critical thinking and an increase of the level of rigor to a 
level of maintenance and consistency in the school. Teachers will receive professional development in different 
thinking maps/organizers and other strategies to assist students in formulating and organizing ideas and making their 
thinking visible. Teachers will work toward looking for ways to accurately assess progress to ensure that they are 
properly addressing the necessary skills and level of rigor in units of study planning to ensure that the lesson 
objectives are geared in the right direction. The school learning community will look for ways to consistently use data 
to make curriculum and instructional decisions.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The special student population that the school has identified is our English Language Learner population. This group 
has been identified due to the size of this population and how it is rapidly growing with the school community. The 
specific needs for this group encompass a wide range of areas. Students must be provided with appropriate rigorous 
tasks that have multiple entry levels to ensure success. In addition, they need to be immersed in a highly effective 
English as a New Language Program to support them in language acquisition. The general education teachers requires

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

When reflecting on the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, PS 206 The Horace Harding School made good 
progress in the areas of Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, Collaborative Teachers and Trust. We 
will continue to grow in these elements as they are essential for looking at the big picture of a great school. The two 
areas that we will focus on for the 2018-2019 school year are: Rigorous Instruction and Strong Family and Community 
Ties. As a school community, we will continue to monitor, refine and reflect on all of these elements so that PS 206 
The Horace Harding School will continue to be a great school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Rigorous Instruction on the Framework for Great Schools continues to be a high need area for the school community. 
Currently, 35% of the students in grades 3-5 are proficient in ELA based on New York State test results. This is below 
the city level and the cohort level. Currently 36.1% of our students are proficient in math based on New York State 
test results.. In addition, Rigorous Instruction scored a 3.18 which was below the city average on the Learning 
Environment Survey. However, 3.18 is a 0.5 improvement from 2017-2018 results.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will engage students in rigorous math tasks which measure: conceptual understanding, 
application and fluency. These tasks will be supported through scaffolds, thinking maps, problem solver organizers, the 
use of the tool SOLVE, use of manipulatives, and technology resulting in a proficiency increase in math of 10%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We used Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) to address the social and emotional needs of our 
student. PBIS assisted us with behavior management however the needs of many children were not fully met. The 
success of PBIS may also have been hindered as it was not practiced with fidelity by all staff members. To address the 
social and emotional needs of all of our students we will mandate a morning meeting time in which teachers will 
utilize practices from Sanford Harmony and Power Brain. Sanford Harmony aims to create a classroom where 
students are empowered to: communicate, cooperate, connect, embrace diversity, and resolve conflict. It is a social-
emotional teaching program that cultivates strong classroom relationships between all students. Power Brain utilizes 
an exciting combination of physical, emotional and cognitive exercises to tap into our infinite brain potential. This 
program aims to empower children and adults to improve focus, confidence, memory, creativity and emotional 
wellness while reducing stress and anxiety. Students will arrive at school each day and be able to check in with 
someone that they know cares about their well being. Having this emotional needs met will ensure that students are 
ready and present for learning. Teachers will also be encouraged to use practices from both Power Brain and Sanford 
Harmony throughout the school day to address students' needs as they may arise. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

By February 2019 75% of the parents community will log in to their child's Engrade Pro account. 

 

By February 2019, sign-in sheets for school celebratory events will be reviewed to determine the number of families 
that have attended each event and an average will be generated. Based on this review of data we will determine if 
attendance has a minimum average attendance of 20 families. If 20 or more families average attending these 
celebratory events we will continue with the practice as described herein. If the average number of families attending 
these celebratory events is less than 20 families we will have to analyze the data, such as the theme/title, time and 
date, family feedback, and student participation to determine our next steps.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 206, The Horace Harding School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community.

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
PS 206, The Horace Harding School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

     The population of P.S. 206 reflects the diversity of the surrounding community.  Within our 
targeted population of ENL students we will offer an after school program for 100 students in a 
range of grades 2-5.  The language of instruction will be in English with all of the appropriate 
scaffolds in place.                
Many of our English as a New Language students arrive with no or little  prior schooling.  Others 
come from war-torn countries where their education may have been compromised.  Still, others 
have their learning interrupted by mid-year or extended summer visits to their native lands.  To 
address the unique needs of these children,  our school mission encourages the designing of 
programs that meet the potential of all students.  Therefore, one important goal is to provide and 
implement a curriculum for these English Language Learners..  
There was a total of  190  English Language Learners who took the New York State English as a 
Second Language (NYSESLAT) given in the Spring of 2018.  The results from Spring 2018 
were very positive.  Twenty-one students tested out of services and are now commanding.  Four 
additional students scored level 3 on New York State ELA test and are now commanding.  All 
students moved a minimum of 2 proficiency levels..   
We, therefore, propose the following Title III program: 
For 2018-2019  TItle III ELL After school Program will be developed for students in Grades, 2, 
3, 4, and 5.  We will invite 50 English Language Learners - of all levels to attend the program on 
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  Each class will commence at 2:30 pm.  Students will be 
dismissed at 4:30.   The program will begin on November 14, 2018 and end in April on a date to 
be determined later.  There will be a supervisor on site supervising teachers and students..  
The school has purchased the software program Imagine Learning for our technology 
lab.  Students will work in the technology lab for one full hour to receive customized instruction 
through Imagine Learning to address their weaknesses and to support their strengths.  Upon 
completion of the hour long lab session, students will work directly with a licensed ENL teacher 
in small groups targeting specific areas identified through Imagine Learning and the 
NYSELAT results from 2018. 
The  three specialists will work together as a team with the knowledge of using  necessary 
techniques and scaffolding  for ELL learning.   Teachers will focus on the specific modalities of 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing in language acquisition.   Staff members will develop 
lessons during  the allotted planning time. 
 The staff members will be simultaneously working on areas aligned with the 
NYSESLAT.  Teachers will plan various ESL strategies and activities to be used in the balanced 
literacy model.  We will concentrate on inter-active read-alouds, model reading, shared 
and  paired reading, and shared, paired, and interactive writing.  Academic rigor and content 
vocabulary will play a tremendous impact in vocabulary identification and development. 
Students' strengths and weaknesses will be assessed, and interventions and academic support will 
be planned accordingly.  Assessment will be ongoing through the work in students' portfolio and 
continued conferences.

We are fortunate to have the Queens South Borough Field Support staff as well as the District 28 
superintendent's office.. This year Borough Field Support Center  provided support in the use of 
data when planning and scaffolding instruction for ELLs.. The ENL Team attends these sessions 
and turn-keys the format to the rest of the staff during  teacher team meetings,, Staff 
Development Days,  and during the Professional Development on Mondays.  We want to assure 
the needs of ELLs are addressed.  In addition, our assistant principal attend the ENL Leadership 
Series.  The information is shared with the instructional cabinet and professional development is 
planned for the stakeholders in the school.  The school has partnered with an organization called 
"Consortium" which provides targeted professional development to teachers who provide 
instruction to English Language Learners.  In addition, the facilitator works in the classroom and 
coaches the teachers on their practice and the impact that it has on student 
outcomes.  Professional development is also provided through Imagine Learning so that our 
teachers know how to most effectively implement the program that the students will be using 
during technology lab time. 
  
 
  
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

 Imagine Learning will provide professional learning to the families of our English Language 
Learners.  Since the program the students are engaged in holds a site license, children are able to 
access the program from home and continue to grow and make progress.   
  Another goal for Parent Engagement is to give families effective resources to build literacy and 
knowledge at home.  A Parent Engagement workshop will introduce Read-Home family

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Involvement kits from Benchmark for  grades 2 - 5.  This family kit has informational books  in 
the areas of science and social studies.  The Home Guide to family involvement helps improve 
language arts and content understanding.  Students' reading response journals  encourage 
students to respond to text, extend learning experiences, and practice writing skills.  Both ELLs 
and family members are engaged in literacy activities.  The date is to be determined later. 
To also support the parent community parents/caregivers willl receive dictionaries in their native 
language in order to transition smoothly from their native language to the new English language.  
Another connection for Title III parents and other members of the parent community encompass 
the school sponsored activities.  For example, Family Bingo, Reading By Twilight, Sports Night, 
Visit the Arts Night and  Math Night bring diverse parents and their children together in a 
learning and fun environment.  These dates are to be determined later.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I,           , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and 
staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At the time parents register their child at P.S. 206 Home Language Information Survey is a necessary document in 
the packet. HLIS is a major starting point for collecting data regarding language(s) spoken at home. Entered by the 
Pupil Accounting Secretary, this information allows the school's parental translation and interpretation to be 
addressed. In addition, we can view our Home Language Report via ATS to assess which language translations our 
parent body may require.

School Year 2017-2018 

Our school gives out important 
information about education and

languages. All letters are translated 
through google language and they are 
proofread by our parent coordinator 
(Spanish) and our ENL teacher 
(Russian). In addition, all other 
communications sent home through 
the Chancellor's Office are in the 
native language.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

When the school year opens, our teachers are given a copy of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 so that they are aware 
and knowledgeable about their role in ensuring that all parents have access to the school and its activities. In addition, 
teachers work with the ENL teachers to identify the preferred languages of their families. This information is captured 
on a school contact form which all families complete and all teachers have a copy of. Teachers know that they can ask 
for translation when necessary and it will be provided. Teachers also utilize their i phones for technology support with 
translation.

information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

As stated, all communications go home in the families preferred language. Signs in the lobby and when you enter the 
school inform parents of their ability to receive translation to help them at the school when they attend the different 
events that we host.           
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

      We obtain feedback from parents when they come to the school for their mandated ENL training session and 
through the work of our parent coordinator.
